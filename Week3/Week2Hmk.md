# Homework for Week 2
---
## Question 1

Last week as part of the requirements gathering you had listed down a few applications which you think would be helpful to students. Pick one application from the list and design an User Interface using paper and pen. Take a picture of the UI, upload to google drive and share the link in Discovery tool.

My list of requirements

1. Module Planning can be a headache - academic 'paths' should be created as a visual aid.
2. Linking todo list with luminus uploads, allowing for easy progress tracking.
3. Career pathways - scrapping of linkedin to give undergraduates a better understanding of their trajectory.
4. Application to check if a room's light is on - if it is being used.
5. Peer to peer helping for lower level modules in return for knowledge sharing / other incentives.


For the homework, my selected requirement is idea 5 - a peer to peer service.
Here is an image of the User Interface:
