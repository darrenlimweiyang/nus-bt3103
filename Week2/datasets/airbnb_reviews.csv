2515,198,13/10/08,2603,Jenny,Stephanie was a wonderful host! Her apartment was beautiful and extremely clean. We had a very nice (and affordable!) stay in the city with private room and own bathroom.
2515,859,8/3/09,8455,Roland,"Such a wonderful place and very close to the metro station on the line 1 2 3. She was awesome with us, it was a pleasure to stay in her appt. she's french, so last word ...
Merci encore stephanie pour ton hospitalité. On a passé un super séjour avec toi. Très disponible pour nous avec pleins de conseils, je vous recommande particulierement cette adresse qui plus est pour un prix raisonnable. Le metro est juste a 1 bloc de l'appartement et la ligne 1-2-3 est la plus centrale et la plus pratique de NYC. son quartier est vraiment tres sympa en plus !!! Allez y les yeux fermés."
2515,1083,25/3/09,9759,Cem,"I just got back from a trip to NYC during which I stayed at Stephanie's appartment. The bedroom and private bathroom that comes with it were both kept very clean and are spacious so that I could unpack my stuff and put my clothes away in the closet. I didn't have to live out of my rucksack for ten days which made me already feel comfortable.
The appartment is situated right at the north end of Central Park in Harlem and very close to different subway stations. I could either start my day with a morning stroll through the park and into the Upper West or Upper East Side, or catch the subway to get to Midtown, South Manhattan or Brooklyn in no time. So from a geographical vantage point the appartment is perfectly situated to discover the city.
But apart from all these facts it was above all Stephanie with her warm and welcoming nature that really made me feel comfortable during these days. It is very nice to come ""home"" in the evening, tired after a long day's strolling around, and end the day with a little chit-chat about one's experiences before falling into bed and, with thumb-in-mouth, sleep blissfully through till the next morning.
NYC, I will be back, and I know where I'll be staying! Thank you, Stephanie!!!"
2515,1107,27/3/09,9193,Holly,Stephanie's offered all the most important things: a warm welcome into a comfortable home; a comfortable bed in a quiet room; fresh & clean towels & blankets; and easy access to Manhattan.  Finding myself travelling to NYC in the future I feel I already have a open invitation to make home away from home through Stephanie's generousity.
2515,2175,9/5/09,7048,Alessandra,"Stephanie was really nice, ftiendly and helpful. The room was perfect and it was very easy to go around the town from there. :-)"
2515,2889,20/5/09,12521,Michael,"I was pleasantly surprised with my whole stay at Stepahnie's place. She is the most warm hearted and interesting person and her family is the same.
The whole place is clean aand as described in the ad. I'd go there again any time and thank Stph again for the wonderful stay.
Thanx"
2515,3213,27/5/09,5889,Becca,Stephanie's apt was great. Very convenient to anywhere in NYC you would want to go. Subway stop a block away. I would highly recommend staying there if you get a chance. 
2515,3313,30/5/09,15342,Sarah,"my husband and i had such a great time staying with stephanie! we stayed at chez chic for 3 nights and felt right at home the minute we walked in.  the room is a perfect size, plenty of room for the two of us and a good sized closet for our suitcases, everything was immaculate, clean towels and linens, and the location is great.   not only is stephanie a great hostess, she is also a great resource for things to do in the city which made our stay even better.  i would recommend stephanie to anyone traveling to new york and we cant wait to get back to nyc to see her bed and breakfast!"
2515,7144,10/8/09,26899,Maria Luisa,"When I first arrived at Stephanie's, she was very welcoming! I had no problem finding my way from the subway at Central Park North and I never felt unsafe walking from the subway to the apartment (a 5 min walk)When I got to the apartment complex at 7th ave (Chez Chic)there was no elevator but there was a really friendly neighbor that helped me carry my luggage up the stairs. I met Stephanie's very nice husband and her two beautiful children and they were never a bother! And she even let me use her laptop so I can check my email and keep in touch with my family.
I was free to come and go anytime I wanted to and having my own bathroom was a bonus! The bed was REALLY comfy, the air conditioning was a relief and the closet was spacious.
 Not too far up the street there was a 24 hour market that was awesome with a lot of great stuff to choose from so I was always able to make my own breakfast, lunch and dinner!! Going to and from uptown to midtown Manhattan was very easy and convenient with the subways running 24 hours (only a 25 min ride to Time Square) and there was always people around so you never felt alone!!
Over all I really enjoyed my stay at Chez Chic and New York was a great city! I recommend any place Stephanie has available!! 
Enjoy your time in New York!"
2515,7350,13/8/09,26718,Greg,awesome couldn't have been better.
2515,8463,29/8/09,6407,David,"It was a great week at ""chez chic"". Stephanie and her family were really friendly and she gave us some advices to visit the town. The room was comfortable and the flat was really well situated (5 minutes from subway). We would recommend this place to anyone!"
2515,11177,24/9/09,21062,Linda,"My friend and I stayed at the Chez Chic for ten days. Stephanie was a great host and has such a cute family! She was very easygoing and gave us nice advices going out in harlem so that we loved this place! Her apartment was nice, so that we really enjoyed our sojourn time and would come back any time. tahnks!"
2515,11651,27/9/09,39004,David,"Wonderful hostess, kind, willing to help and offer advice.  We stayed at Chez Chic and enjoyed the premises and felt safe.  Great value as well. I would highly recommend her to anyone.  The site is close to the subway and you can move about the city very easily.
Dave and Denise"
2515,14145,18/10/09,45184,Lizzie,Stephanie was the perfect host... welcoming and generous with her time.  She clued me in to some terrific local cafes and restaurants offering delicious food at reasonable prices and venues for jazz as well.  She even helped my son find the best and safest route to an event he had planned on attending with his college friends.  Overall very professional and accommodating.    
2515,14349,20/10/09,35090,Aris,"I was pleasantly surprised to see a clean room, elegantly decorated in a quiet flat within walking distance from Central Park. Stephanie is very helpful and her house deserves the title Chez Chic. "
2515,16302,5/11/09,44089,Robert,"What a great location and welcome from Stephanie and her family! We arrived late on Friday night and Stephanie was there to welcome us. She provided excellent local information and also directions to downtown, which proved vital on the day of the marathon. The room was excellent and the bed was very comfortable, was also great to come home to a warm house very night! Living with Stephanie and her family added to our New York experience and we would recommend it to anyone.

Thanks Stpehanie!"
2515,25151,31/1/10,68057,Niloufar,"Wow..It was one of my best trip ever. My husband and I had an amazing time in Stephanie's Place. We stayed 3 days at her place. It was a super clean apartment and we had whatever we need in the apartment, like TV,Telephone,Internet,the clean towels and well equipped kitchen. I would definitely recommend the place and the Stephanie as a host. She is so nice and very helpful. Stephanie gave us a map of NYC and great tips on where to go. 
Thanks a lot dear Stephanie! You made our trip!"
2515,25500,5/2/10,1470208,Katie,Stephanie was such a wonderful host! We were familiar with the NYC area but she went out of her way to make sure we knew how to get around her area in particular and had tons of suggestions for things to do and places to go. Everyone there was wonderful and she made us feel right at home. We had a great time and would consider her again when visiting New York City. 
2515,28524,7/3/10,76069,Angelica,"It is an excellent place to stay! Clean, quiet, warm, everything is close, the park, the subway..
We had a great time there!"
2515,28930,10/3/10,80901,Ariel & Sam,What a wonderful apartment and room! We stayed for two nights at the Chez Chic and it was lovely! Stephanie and her family were away on a trip so we had the whole apartment to ourselves -- which was incredible! Her wonderful friend Sophie helped us get all set up and keys and gave us a warm welcome. We will totally stay here again next time we are in the Big Apple and hopefully we'll get to meet Stephanie and her lovely family.
2515,40150,5/5/10,24048,Jessica,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Chez Chic and it was absolutely fantastic! Stephanie is a very welcoming, open, and accommodating host. The neighborhood is lovely and picturesque. Stephanie has a sophisticated taste for interior design and art. (She also has the cutest kids!) 
The serene Central Park is down the street and the efficient subway is a block away. Our first-time stay in New York would not have been complete without this ""local"" experience.  We definitely recommend her to everyone and hope to cross paths again in the future.  :D  5 stars! Thank you, Stephanie!"
2515,46980,28/5/10,71663,Alexandra,
2515,51242,9/6/10,116704,Alice,"Stephanie and her family are warm and welcoming, offering assistance and advice without being at all intrusive. The place is clean, in a dynamic neighborhood and close to central park and transport. People who have difficulties with stairs might wish to avoid this place as there are five floors to be negotiated to reach the front door."
2515,59526,1/7/10,70724,Betty,"It was the 1st time my boyfriend and I were going to NYC!Our stay at stephanie's was just amazing!!!!We arrived late in the evening but stephanie was there to welcome us and give us lots of useful tips about New York!Her family is so friendly and her little son is so funny! The neighborhood is really pleasant!Her neighbors called her as we didn't have any service on our phone ! The apartment is very close to Central Park North and Harlem Meer (just a few steps to get there!)and also close to subway and bus station!
She always asked us if we needed anything!
You can go there with complete confidence you won't be disappointed! Trust me!

Some advice if you arrive at JFK and you don't want to spend too much money in transportation:Take the airtrain to Jamaica Station and then take the A line(subway)to Manhattan.Change at 42th Street Times Square to C line uptown and stop at 110th Street Cathedral Pkwy. Then you'll just have to walk 5 or 10 minutes and you'll be there!

2515,64294,13/7/10,140772,Steve,"Stephanie was a great host and the apartment suited our needs perfectly.
Thanks very much for being so kind and considerate on our first visit to the big apple!
Steve and Amanda "
2515,66624,19/7/10,138191,Tammy,"My husband and i stayed with Stepanie and her family at the Chez Chic Private Room for 4 nights.  The accomodations were wonderful.  Stephanie was a fabulous hostess.  We had so much privacy that it felt like we were in our own apartment most of the time.  Stephanie was great with giving us directions and recommendations of places to eat and visit.  Everything was absolutely wonderful.  The room is very quiet and clean and comfortable.  Everything is exactly as Stephanie advertises.  My husband and I left the city with a new found appreciation for Harlem thanks to Stephanie and her family.  We absolutely cannot wait to stay with Stephanie again.  We would recommend her to anyone coming to NYC!!!!!! We already have multiple times.  Thank you Stephanie, for everything!!!! :)"
2515,74208,5/8/10,182441,Jennifer,We had a wonderful experience with Stephanie!  Thank you!  We had our 11 mth old baby with us and she enjoyed it a lot as well.

2515,95059,12/9/10,68468,Olivier And Ingrid,Nous avons passé un agréable séjour chez Stéphanie et sa famille. Encore merci pour tous ces conseils et astuces! 
2515,100036,19/9/10,69604,Cyril,Stephanie is a very welcoming host. All the family was very nice. It was a wonderful experience in NYC!
2515,109011,1/10/10,119293,Sabrina,"We spent a very pleasant stay at Stephanie's apartment. Everything was just perfect: the room, the bathroom and her welcoming family! The location of the apartment is also a strength (5-min walk from the subway - main lines and from Central Park). My sister and myself recommend you this place for your future stay in NY, you won't regret it ! =) Thanks again to Stephanie !!!  "
2515,137500,12/11/10,185050,Gerry,"We stayed at the 111th Street apartment with Stephanie and her family. As an alternative to staying in an ""Overpriced"" New York tourist hotel, I'd recommend it to anyone. I'd stayed in NY a few times before and while this was the furthest Uptown I'd stayed, the access to transport is so easy (Ensure you buy an unlimited travel card) so no matter where we wanted to go it didn't take too long. If it's your first time in NY, Stephanie is able to advise on places to go and see."
2515,142514,22/11/10,232860,Flavia,Stephanie and her family are friendly. They respected my privacy and the room was as I expected. The location of the apartment is very good for public transportation and the apartment is clean. I had a calm and pleasant stay there.
2515,158502,26/12/10,202714,Katharina,We had a great time at Stephanies apartment - everything was perfect. The apartment is very well located. The subway is just around the corner and you can get fast to the Times Square. Stephanie and her family are very friendly and helpful. We recommend you this place for a stay in NY.
2515,164671,3/1/11,329733,Corinne,"It was the firts time we used airbnb and we are very happy of this experience.  Stephanie really made us feel welcome from the first second.The house is clean, warm, very quiet and the bed is extremely comfortable. Stephanie is a very helpful and informative host. As this was our first trip to NYC we were not sure which neighborhoods would be safe to stay in. Stephanie's home is in a quiet building and my boyfriend and I both felt very safe. We highly recommend staying in Stephanie's home. 
What can we say? All in our stay was great and we would definitely recommend Stephanie's places to our friends and to anyone. Much better than a hotel, and probably cheaper!   It's New York a great city and Stephanie is a perfect host. 
Thanks Stephanie. We will come back soon."
2515,173011,21/1/11,41756,Katrin,"Best host I ever had - Stefanie and her family are very kind, helpful and accommodating - you will feel at home here immediately. The place is very nice, clean and you can't beat the access to both the B and C as well as the 2 and 3 subway lines, both each 1.5 blocks away! Will definitely come back!"
2515,175677,28/1/11,352151,Bailey,"I had an extremely comfortable stay in ""chez chic guest room #1.""  Stephanie and her family are very nice and hospitable folks.  It was nice to feel at ""home"" while in NYC. "
2515,186455,22/2/11,353829,Beatriz,"It was very nice staying at Stephanie's place with her and her family. The room is confortable and the shared spaces as the kitchen and the bathroom were clean. 
The communication was excellent, very close to Central Park, the subway and buses. A perfect location to visit the museums: Guggenheim and MET are very close with the M4, M2 and M3 buses that take you through the 5th avenue, it’s a beautiful ride.
Thanks!
"
2515,203685,20/3/11,382310,Aleksander,"We had a wonderful time staying at Stephanie's and her family. To room was clean and provided anything we needed for our stay. We had our own shared bathroom and could also use the kitchen supplies. 
Stephanie and her family were very open to our questions and offered suggestions on things to see in New York.  
The area was perfectly located near two subway stations and close to the Harlem nightlife as well as Central Park. We can only recommend Stephanie's for any New York visitor."
2515,219657,7/4/11,375654,Joris,"Nous sommes restés 5 nuits chez stephanie et sa petite famille. l'expérience était trés enrichissante et le logement était pratique, proche de toute commodité (2 stations de métro à proximité).

Coming from South Africa where there is little or no public transport, we found it so easy and accessible and we felt totally safe.Stephanie and her family made us feel so welcome and at home and we recommend this accommodation to those who are looking for a short or long stay.

Pour nos amis Français, et pour tous ceux qui comprendront ce message,  qui hésitent encore  de voyager vers cette ville mystérieuse de New-York, n’hésitez plus en tant que hôte de Stéphanie. Sa gentillesse, sa disponibilité, son attachante petite famille, tout cela en préservant votre intimité vous raviront. Stéphanie n’est point avare de bons conseils et la situation de son hébergement facilite grandement la découverte de la « ville qui ne dort jamais » : un bloc de Central Park et  5 minutes du métro qui vous enverra  vers Manhattan et au cœur de Harlem (quartier très sûr).
Encore une fois, avec Stéphanie, votre séjour n’en sera que plus agréable et nous la remercierons jamais assez.
Karine et Ludo.

She knows a lot about the city and gives good insider tips. They provided us with maps of the area, the Metro and more. Also, towels, an adapter and an umbrella were present. We felt very welcome and can recommend a stay with Stephanie a lot."

L'appartement est exactement comme dans la description, joliment décoré et bien situé, à deux pas du métro. Stéphanie nous a donné plein de bons conseils durant notre séjour, et c'est sans hésiter que nous choisirons à nouveau de loger chez eux lors de notre prochain voyage à NY ! Merci pour tout..."
2515,392546,24/7/11,617787,Clémentine & Thomas,"Très bien accueillis par une amie de la famille. L'appartement est très propre et bien situé. Nous avons pu être parfaitement indépendant et bien profiter de NY.
(Heureusement la chambre était climatisée parce qu'il a fait une chaleur difficilement supportable.)
C'est un très bon séjour.
Très envie de revenir vite!!"
2515,519749,11/9/11,379695,Eric,"The room was nice and clean and conformed exactly to the description on airbnb. It was calm and the closet offered a lot of space to put away all my belongings. The kitchen and the living room can be used generously. And to have a bathroom of your own, sometimes shared with guests from the other room, is very agreeable. To be so near to Central Park and the Subway is wonderful either. And Harlem has its own special charm: It is a very varied sort of village within the Big Apple.
For the lovely opportunity to enjoy this fascinating city, I'm very grateful."
2515,564350,25/9/11,363433,Tom,"We stayed at the Chez Chic budget room for a week. Stephanie was a great host, she respected our privacy and she provided us with information about the neighbourhood. The room is quite spacious en very clean. The bathroom is shared with other guests, but although the other room was constantly occupied, we practically never had to wait for the bathroom to be free. The wireless internet worked just fine, just as the television with digital channels. 
There are two subway stations at approximately 4-5 min walking distance. Lines 2,3, B and C depart form these stations. We felt safe in the neighourhood. Overall, we would definately recommend to stay at this apartment!"
2515,637557,17/10/11,1138528,Nils,"I went by Stephanie's place with my mother and she set up everything for us when we arrived, better than a hotel! we didn't spend much more time with her as we were visiting a lot. She make us feel being independant which is nice. We could use the kitchen in the morning. It was simple, clear efficient, close to the metro. The place is quiet, there are not so many bars around, but we went to the bier restaurant nearby which is good and serve quite late, passed 10:30pm! "

2515,760569,3/12/11,1358563,Katherine,"Stephanie made us feel right at home! The week we were there, another couple was renting the room across the hall, but we rarely saw them. My fiance and I spent a week here for multiple different interviews in the city, and we had no problem getting anywhere from this location. There was easy access to multiple subway lines. "
2515,771287,8/12/11,916462,Gloria,"Felt very welcome, comfortable and safe since our arrival.  The place was very clean, the bathroom was clean and spacious.  The room has a useful big closet and it was very quiet.  We could use the kitchen any time in the day to make tea and coffee. Being a block from central park was a real treat.  The neighborhood was interesting although there were some streets that looked rough but we didn't have any problems at all.  There are plenty of good restaurants and bars in Harlem if you want to explore the area.  I would definitely come back to stay here and I will recommend it to my friends.  "
2515,994854,13/3/12,1029701,Mark,great location. great host. 
2515,1013855,18/3/12,1789177,Nicole,"Spent two nights and it was perfect!  Close to several subways/bus stops and a nice, quiet neighborhood.  The room was huge and bathroom very clean (even while sharing with guests in another room).  Stephanie and her family were very kind and welcoming.  I can't not say enough wonderful things about my experience!  The only thing is beware that the building has no elevator and is a bit of a climb to the apartment.  It isn't too bad since you're not in NYC to stay in your room :-)"
2515,1195487,29/4/12,1285603,Caroline,"The appartment was great, in a really nice location and we had a great time there. The room was big, clean, and well decorated, we really enjoyed staying there! "

Stephanie was very patient - my plans changed multiple times; and she and Sophie were both very quick to respond to the couple of problems that arose during my stay.  Getting there by the M60 and M2 buses was fast and easy.  The location is great.  Although I didn't have a chance to go into Central Park, it was wonderful to have that greenery so close by.  There's a corner grocery store right across the street.  "
2515,1340850,24/5/12,2148108,Lauralee,"Stephanie and Sophie's place was great! Our schedules didn't end up lining up so we didn't get to meet them in person but they were very prompt and helpful when answering questions before our arrival. The room and apartment were very clean, comfortable and quiet! Being right next to Central Park was fantastic too. I'd recommend staying here!"
2515,1437748,8/6/12,2178425,Said,"This is a great place to stay when you are visiting New York. The rooms are tidy and tastefully decorated. Our room had a TV and plenty of space to store our luggage. We also had access to a fully equipped kitchen which is great if you want to cook, although you probably won’t because you will find great restaurants and markets in Harlem and in the Upper West side nearby. The subway and Central Park are both one block away and the neighborhood is safe to navigate even at night. Columbia University and the Riverside Park are just blocks away and definitely worth a visit. "
2515,1495779,17/6/12,1675171,Nico & Claire,"Superbe appartement. En revanche, attention, la description ne correspond pas tout à fait. En effet, il s'agit d'un appartement dont toutes les chambres sont louées et non pas d'une chambre d'hôte chez l'habitant. L’ambiance est donc dépendante des autres colocataires. Sur ce point, nous n'avons eu aucun problèmes. 
L'appartement est idéalement placé, à 5min à pied des métros, de Central Park et de nombreux commerces. Le quartier est aussi très bien, contrairement aux idées reçues, l'atmosphère y est très agréable.

Nous reviendrons sans problème :)"

 Дом имеет удобное расположение, находится рядом с центральным парком, недалеко есть 2 станции метро.
В квартире есть все что нам было нужно - кухня, ванная, спальня, интернет. Летом в Нью-Йорке душно, спасал кондиционер. В целом - все понравилось, спасибо хозяевам. "
2515,1923033,8/8/12,2484431,Alba,"I recommend everyone to stay in Stephanie's house. If you have any doubt... Just send me a message! It was my best choice. Very clean, place to put your food in the kitchen, the family is awesome!
Subway very near.

2515,1972956,13/8/12,3057783,James,Lovely simple room and comfortable bed. Very clean. No view but excellent aircon! Great location for exploring manhattan and walks in central park. Stephanie was charming and very helpful. Excellent value for money.
2515,2213042,6/9/12,2382063,Mélanie,"Nous avons vraiment adoré notre séjour chez Stéphanie. Tres accueillante et qui a su prendre le temps de nous donner de nombreux questions. Toujours disponible.
Le logement est tres bien situé, au calme et avec toutes les commodités nécessaires. Si nous devions retourner à New York, ce serait inévitablement chez Stéphanie. Mélanie & Anthony"
2515,2230438,8/9/12,3150890,Bruno,"We had such an amazing experience staying over stephanie's place. We didn't have a specific time to arrive because we came from abroad, but she was very flexible with this. Arriving there, she was very kind by giving us a map from the subway and all the restaurants around and giving us tips about New York. She showed us the house and made us very comfortable staying there. 
We could use the kitchen, the fridge and the phone. We had wi-fi that worked normally (thank God!!!)
The room was perfectly clean and organized, with AC, TV, towels, clean sheets, fan, etc.  The bathroom was very clean too. 
Not to mention that there are two subway stations less than a block away, which makes everything so easy. We bought a 7-day pass and in 10 minutes from the place, we were downtown. 
In a nutshell, I don't have anything bad to say about the place at all. Actually, the opposite. I deeply recommend staying there and if I have to go to NYC again, that's the place I will stay. "
2515,2258554,10/9/12,3491796,Christina,"Stephanie and her husband are very friendly, open minded people. They have a lot of experience in hosting people, you can check in in no time and they have all the information about the room, apartment and also the neighbourhood ready, as well as a city map. They helped us a lot with useful tips!
The room is very comfortable and looks chic and nicely decorated. Stephanie provides towels and the bath room is tidy and quite clean.
They are very nice people and I would stay there again anytime."
2515,2824866,7/11/12,3538770,Juan Pablo,"Stephanie and her family were excellent hosts. They helped us a lot with their hints (were to go at nights and were to buy good food at low cost). They were very kind and  the apartment were we stayed at was great. It is close to the subway and buses, and only 2 blocks away from Central Park. It was a pleasure to stay there!. It's been really a pleasure to meet you. Thanks a lot."

They answered all my questions... gave directions, maps, etc. The apartament is very cozy and the neighborhood is friendly. I really recommend stay with her!! 

Ficar na apartamento da Stephanie foi uma experiência a parte. Ela e sua família são muito legais.... me ajudaram com tudo que precisei. Até informações específicas sobre locais  ela conseguiu encontrar para mim. Eu recomendo 100% ficar no apartamento dela.... não irão se arrepender. Eu ficarei novamente lá da próxima vez que eu for a NYC."

2515,3603301,22/2/13,1562913,Marina,"I was staying in this apartment only for 3 days. It's really good place to stay in NYC. The apartment is big enough and very comfortable. Only 3 min walking to subway and Central Park. The father of a family with a small lovely child took me so warm! He was really fan and glad to help me.
Room furnished pleasantly and has everything. Bathroom is shared but I have never encountered someone because they have another bathroom.
I did not use the kitchen but Abdul showed me where I can put my stuff. Because of the big size of apartment no one bothers to each other and I didn't hear any noise. 
I recommend this apartment for your travel!"
2515,5370427,26/6/13,6545626,Kevin,"My wife and I stayed at Stephanie for 3 nights. We haven't met our host as we were out most of the time. Our stay was fine. The location of the apartment is good as being very close to main metro station and front of Central Park and the neighborhood is quite. The room is of a correct size (we are in NYC) and was clean at our arrival; just to mention that the a/c is noisy and despite the a/c and the fan in the room, we felt somehow hot (during summer). The bathroom is fine but to share with another room."
2515,5613012,8/7/13,6837286,Arjun,"It was a decent location. People who want to visit n do touristy stuff, I suggest live closer to lower west side of manhattan. 

Although no complaints about the place or stephanie. The place is really close to blue and red line subways. You get your own set of house keys, so you can come in and go out anytime you want.

Very comfortable stay"

The only thing was that was an inconvenient was that the AC made a lot of noise the first night but worked perfectly fine the second. I would surely recommend this place to others.

C'est un grand et bel appartement fonctionnel et décoré avec goût. Tous les critères pour passer de bonnes vacances sont réunis : chambre et salle de bain spacieuses et équipées, ménage impeccable. À moins de 5 minutes à pieds des lignes de métro 2,3,A,B,C,D : un bonheur pour découvrir la grande pomme.
Je recommande fortement cette location quelque soit votre situation (seul, en couple, entre amis en famille).
Stéphanie et ses proches vous accueillent chaleureusement et vous donnent pleins de conseils avisés pour passer un excellent moment.

Steph also gave us some lists about the great places to eat and hangout nearby. but in NY, i think we better not go home late coz its not very safe out there at night. anyway, we enjoyed our stay and we love Steph's place and her family."
2515,10664279,2/3/14,11077861,Patricia,"Stephanie and her family were always available, helpful and nice to us. Eventhough the bedroom and the apartment were a little smaller than they appeared in the pictures, they were still very nice looking, clean and cozy. The bed is fantastic - you'll want to sleep a bit more! We found the neighborhood safe, but some nights, when I came home late and alone, some men did bother me on the street from the subway to the apartment. Nothing serious, though - just a little annoying. Apart from that, the location is very good. We found everything we needed within 5min of walk (dining, laundry). There are two subway lines also within 5min of walk. One of them is express and takes you to Times Square in 15min.  It is also very nice to be so close to the Central Park and to take walks over there sometimes. Overall, staying with Stephanie and her family was a very nice experience. We recommend and would definetely stay there again if we come back to NYC!"

Had maps and coupons and restaurant/shopping guides for us ready to use, very helpful :) Good AC in the room which was fantastic! Apartment was pretty full of people, so if you want a more private stay, might not be the best, but everyone was respectful and your room was a very private space. Would recommend staying here :)"

En cuanto a NY sin palabras , es una ciudad increíble y siempre queras volver a ella, solo que ahora sentimos que tenemos un lugar donde siempre podremos llegar que es donde Stephanie! "

Her children are very cute and playful, a heart-melting sight :)

The room is nice and clean, there's a master double bed as well as an auxiliary single bed that doubles as a sofa. A pleasant surprise was that there was a safe in the room we could use as well as we could lock the room doors. While we had felt secure and safe in the apartment, it's nice to have a safe to leave stuff in instead of hauling it across the city.

There is a guest bathroom that is shared with one more guest, clean and pristine!

The neighbourhood is great, very close to central park and the subway as well as near to plenty of good restaurants.

I'd definitely recommend staying at this place and would certainly stay here again when in in NYC."

I must say we were very excited to get to the beautiful place few meters close to the northern central park after having a long flight from the south of States. She got in touch with us in the early morning of our arrival day and was absolutely in time at home waiting for us to come. We got the keys from our room and appartment, listened to the short, but highly valuable how-to-use instructions and peacefully enjoyed our trip for all the days left.
Thank you very much, you are all amazing

I also really like how the room is located right next to the front door so I could come and go without feeling like I was disturbing anyone.

Stephanie, su marido y sus hijos han sido muy amables con nosotros. Nos han ayudado en todo lo que hemos necesitado y han contestado todas nuestras preguntas.

And of course the central park right outside the door is just amazing, especially in the summer. Clean towels were available and we had our own bath room.

2515,67227407,27/3/16,61961333,Stephanie,"Everything was great! Being our first time in New York City we immediately felt welcomed before our arrival and once we actually arrived. We took an early fight to NYC on Friday so we could have the whole day to explore and when letting Mizi know this before booking our flights she was more than willing to accommodate us this early. How many hotels can you check into this early? Not many. This option and Mizi's flexibility to work with us allowed us to make the most out of our time in NYC since we were only there for the weekend. Mizi just let us know to text her when we were leaving the airport so that she could be ready for our arrival. A plus is that the LaGuardia airport was only 15 minutes away! We arrived to Mizi's around 8:45am and she welcomed us with open arms. 

Mizi was great and the hospitality was superb. When we first arrived she informed us of our accommodations and was kind enough to sit down with us an explain where everything was located in the city. She was very helpful and directed us to the closet metros, gave us a map, told us where Times Square was, assisted us with local dining questions, and overall made our time memorable. Even though there were other people occupying other spaces within the home even they were nice! Everyone was willing to give advice and showed us a great time. While she had a family everyone was still extremely respectful and pleasant. 

Mizi made sure that we had an extra key to the apartment which was great in case we wanted to come in and out as we pleased. The rooms were positioned at the front of the home, so it was easy to come in without disturbing the family. We made sure our noise was limited as we respected the host's wishes, but she made sure that we were also having a good time; she even invited us to an event she was hosting in NYC!!!

The neighborhood was close to many things and local restaurants were only blocks away. Harlem Tavern, which was only blocks away, is a nice place to go eat and is fairly priced too. Harlem Tavern stays open late, has a great selection of food, and has a wide variety of music that they play in the restaurant; Mizi recommended it and we gave it a A+. If we ever visit NYC again we will definitely say with Mizi. 

The hospitality was great and could not have been better elsewhere! The room was spacious enough for two people, had closet space, a tv, chair, trash can, etc and the apartment had Wi-Fi!!! The room and bathroom space were always clean as well!!! If you are looking for something cost efficient, in a good location, and has great hospitality check this Chic living space out!!! Thanks Mizi!!! :)"

Tiene las lineas de metro 2, 3 (Website hidden by Airbnb) unos pocos minutos. 
La habitación estaba limpia y tenia todas las comodidades (mesa con TV y espacio para el portátil, wifi, butaca, armario empotrado y una estantería muy práctica). También tuvimos toallas limpias y un secador de pelo. El baño lo compartimos con otra pareja pero esto no fue un problema en absoluto. 
En cuanto a la cocina, es familiar y acogedora (incluso un día había flores naturales!). Tuvimos acceso a ella por completo y también nos ofrecieron café para desayunar. 
Aunque conocimos a Mizi unos días después de alojarnos en su apartamento porque se encontraba de viaje, el primer día su compañero nos recibió muy simpáticamente. Ambos en todo momento nos hicieron sentir como en casa y respondieron todas nuestras dudas sobre el transporte y la ciudad. También nos recomendaron supermercados y bares con música en vivo.

O bairro é SUPER tranquilo e seguro, estações de metro muito próximas!!
Compartilhamos o banheiro com outros viajantes de outro quarto. 
Eles demoravam apenas para trocar o lixo do banheiro e repor papel higienico.. De resto, tudo perfeito! (:

Her family is superbly lovely and the place is very easy to find and so close to different lines on 110th street that allows us to do so many things in the 3 days we are in NY. I would highly recommend this place and would love to be back for my next NY trip!"

Central Park is a Minute away and there are many Bars and Restaurants in this area. Mizi was a very welcoming host and helped us with whataver we needed. We would definitely come back next time!"
2515,100943858,11/9/16,22336430,Paolo,"The room was not the same as showed in the room page, smaller and with a small size bed. The shared bathroom was not that clean, partly caused by the other guest who were sharing it, that left dirt and their used belongings and towels everywhere all the 4 days I stayed there (despite house rules were very clear about it). Host is friendly and kindly provided informations and services needed, but I advice little more care about the accomodation for the future. All the many others positive reviews could not be mistaking, so I hope mine was just a ""not so lucky"" situation."
2515,106592697,7/10/16,18258773,Olivia,"The apartment is under some renovation work (painting, rearrangement etc.) during our stay. The room is not exactly the same as the pictures. Overall is acceptable. And Stephanie is willing to offer help. My friend was sick at the beginning of our trip and feels better after having some food and drinks from Stephanie. She is a nice host."

The room and bathroom were clean and the house has a great location. Central Park is just across the street and there are several subway lines nearby. The neighborhood seemed like a safe place when we walked home around 3 AM. If you plan a trip to New York this is an excellent place to start your adventure."

La estación de metro y autobus quedan cerca, lo cual es muy conveniente. La habitación es realmente cómoda y tiene todo lo que buscábamos. Mizi fue muy amable con nosotros cada vez que la vimos. Muy recomendable!"

The room, however, looks different from the photos provided. The bathrooms  oils be cleaner. The sink has dust all over it and the trash can is almost always full. Had to write messages to the host so they could take out the trash and replace the toilet paper. Went a night without toilet papers. But the hosts are nice and the home is pretty good. "
2515,136888717,12/3/17,110121147,Nadine,"Ich habe den Aufenthalt bei Stephanie sehr genossen. Aus Umständen kam ich leider erst um 11 Uhr abends an, aber Stephanie hat auf mich gewartet und mich herzlich empfangen, trotz dass es so spät war. Da ich ihre Nummer hatte, hat die Kommunikation super geklappt. Da ich während meines Aufenthalts sehr viel Sightseeing gemacht habe, war ich nur abends im Apartment. Aber ich hatte Ruhe und konnte mich dort nach dem langen Tag gut entspannen, auch wenn man vom Flur Stimmen oder Schritte hört. Das Zimmer und Apartment ist kleiner, als es auf den Fotos scheint, doch ist sehr gemütlich und heimisch. Das Zimmer und Bad war sauber und schön eingerichtet. Die Matratze war für mich ein bisschen zu hart, trotzdem konnte ich gut schlafen. Auch dass ich das Bad mit anderen teilen musste, war kein Problem. Es war immer frei, wenn ich es benutzen wollte. Stephanie ist eine sehr liebe und sympathische Frau und auch ihr Mann und Kinder sind sehr nett und respektieren die Privatsphäre ihrer Gäste. Ich denke, sie sind es schon gewohnt Gäste zu haben. Meinen Koffer durfte ich bis zu meinem Rückflug, auch wenn ich ausgecheckt hatte, im Apartment lassen. Ich kann sie nur empfehlen! "

We became very helpful information about food stores that sell fresh and healthy food and the subway system which has to nearby stations but is a bit confusing at the beginning.  The room had enough space and the bed felt very comfortable. We would defenetly book here again!

2515,227644627,15/1/18,100270998,Jeremy,"Misi’s place is very close to Central Park. You have access to the kitchen and share a bathroom with the other guests. I only saw the other guests like twice, but they were very nice. Mizi was really nice and gave us information about places to eat in the area, where we could do laundry, what subways and busses we can take, and where the nearest library was so my wife could do some homework on a desktop. She always kept the TP stocked up and provided a hair dryer. Her place is close to the Seinfeld restaurant (if your a Seinfeld fan), so we had Sunday brunch there (it was packed), but the food was reasonably priced. Our favorite place in Harlem was a small coffee shop called Monkey Cup. We went there because we thought it would be fun to have monkey faces on our coffee, but we were very impressed with the taste as well. Best coffee we had on the whole trip. Mizi also told us about the restaurant right across the street, we ate there on taco Tuesday. They were 3 bucks a piece. We ordered the fish, pork, and steak. They were all great."
2515,229237630,22/1/18,145240513,Majo,"Mizi's place is GREAT! She and her family are very kind, they take care of very little details that make the difference. I arrived to her house and left her place in the middle of the night, both times, but she waited for me awake the first day, and she ensured I had an appointment with a taxi service on the day of departing. The neibourghood is beautiful, excellent location and pretty quiet at nights, but safe enough. I walked alone through its streets at late hours and I can guarantee that. The bedroom is even better that it's shown in the pictures, it's absolutely clean and cozy, and so is the bathroom. This is the perfect shelter for a stay in the Big Apple, regardless off the length of the trip."
2515,234063490,11/2/18,168600521,めい,"駅も近く非常に快適。夜も比較的安全と言われ、夜12時ぐらいに帰ってもそんなに危険な感じはしなかった。ただ周りにお店は少ないので、朝食をニューヨークの素敵なお店で食べたい場合は最終日の飛行機を遅い時間するのがオススメ。
ラガーディア空港からバスで大体40分、地下鉄最寄の駅は徒歩2~3分ぐらいで、最寄の駅につくのはExpressの電車なので、ダウンタウンへの移動も早い。
値段も高くなく、ホストもとても優しい方。

Was zu erwähnen wäre ist höchstens noch dass sich die Wohnung im dritten Stock befindet, das Treppenhaus etwas eng ist und kein Fahrstuhl vorhanden ist. Das Bad teilt man sich eventuell mit anderen Gästen, also Pech falls jemand anders duscht und man dringend ins Bad muss. Ansonsten kann man sich wirklich nicht beschweren bei dem Preis. Die billigsten Hotels in NY sind doppelt so teuer."

Die Wohnung und unser Zimmer waren sehr schön eingerichtet und wir hatten genügend Platz um uns auch mal zwischen den Sightseeingtouren auszuruhen.
Das eigene Bad, welches wir uns mit dem anderen Paar teilten war sauber und schön. Mizi hat uns super herzlich empfangen und uns tolle Tipps rund um New York gegeben und uns Restaurants in der Umgebung empfohlen.
DI Lage ist mehr als perfekt, da man in 10 Minuten mit der U-Bahn am Times Square ist und auch die Gegend rund um das Appartement sehr schön und vorallem sicher ist.

The room itself is a great space with a super-comfy bed and lovely traditional ceiling fan. The street is pleasant, tree-lined and quiet and the townhouse is located a short, convenient walk from the F train, which has been perfect for getting to my office here.

It's easy to see why John's a Super Host and I look forward to staying with him again!"

Nous avons apprécier L'appartement qui est très bien situé. Agréable, propre et bien soigné. C'est idéal pour une famille de 3 ou 4 personnes.
Petits soucis en arrivant il y avait personne pour nous recevoir, et il manquait le savon pour la douche, le liquide vaisselle, nous les avons reçu de surlendemain. Il y a aussi le bruit du Métro de NY, donc une première nuit difficile si on est pas habitué. Jennifer est correcte le remboursement de la caution était très rapide.

A big spacious room with a pointy roof, which really makes you feel like staying in a castle. The location is perfect. It is just a few steps from Macy's Time Square and Theatre District. Everything worked just perfect with the keys etc. Thank you so much Jennifer, we had a great time in New York.
Attention: it's on the 4th floor without a lift :-) but definetely worth it!"

Midtown castle is a beauftiful and tastful place, Jennifer and Tori relaxed and friendly hosts - thats why we - the three Berliners - recommand that place! Good to have WiFi and a little kitchen too!"

Would say our greatest compliments to Jennifer, the host of Midtown Castle. We spent in this lovely apartment in the heart of Manhattan one month (April, 2012) and will remember this time as ours best.
The apartment is pretty spacious and great located - the 5-th Ave right around the corner. There is everything you can need during your short or long stay. Jennifer is very friendly, vigorous and very responsible host. Thanks her and highly recomend this apartment for everyone who are looking for a quiet place right in the center of the boiling Midtown!"

Thanks !"
2595,2022498,18/8/12,2124102,Melanie,"This apartment is like a real castle old and unique. The age- related stains on the bathroom floor and dark discolorations in the carpet too indeed indicate that the building was built a long, long time ago. 
We weren’t happy with the way the apartment was cleaned. Jennifer, the host sent in a cleaning lady right the next morning and therefore did everything she thought was appropriate to make our stay comfortable. She let us know that guest satisfaction is important to her.   
After we found out that the key for the main entrance was missing by locking ourselves out in the middle of the night she was so kind to bring us the missing key within an hour. 
We had to leave the apartment a few days earlier because we suffered from an allergic reaction (which has never happened before and never after) related to the air conditioner as our doctor told us. 
The apartment is located in a great area! Subway stations are just two minutes away! The area seems quite safe although there are “special” adult video stores located in the same street nearby.  
A deli/grocery store is next to the building, a 24 hours open pharmacy is across the end of the street!

Although she could not meet with us herself, she had a friend meet with us to give us the keys and more information when we arrived. She was also very accommodating with our flight schedule and check out. 

The apartment was great overall, although just a little smaller than we expected from the pictures. Our favorite part was of course the skylight and dart board she had hanging. The apartment was in clean condition when we arrived, which is always a good thing!

The location was amazing, close to everything, a great place to stay for our first visit to New York.  It is on the top floor, so we definitely got our workout in going up and down those stairs each day! 

We had a blast!

She supplied books and notes with all sorts of information about NY, the flat and the area. The flat is in the perfect location, not more than a 10 minute walk from Times Square and about the same distance from Penn station. The apartment itself is just as described, great for one or two people. I highly recommend the apartment and will surely use it again next time I'm in NY!"
2595,69547296,11/4/16,16512817,Gary,"Jennifer was an unbelievable host! Great communication and made sure I was all set for my big weekend with my college age daughter.

I love all parts of NYC, but if you want Midtown, this is just about perfect. The place is sunny and bright and surpisingly little noise from the street on Friday and Saturday night. Plus, we felt very safe.

Size wise, 1-2 people is probably perfect. Any more may feel a little cramped.

Lastly, most Airnb places I stay feel liked they have been furnished by a recent college grad. It's clear that Jennifer lives here and was so accomodating opening up her home to us."

She also let me have a late check out at no extra cost, which was very kind of her. 5 stars for that! On the negative side, it was rather cold in the room. I stayed there for 6 nights end of November, beginning of December so the central heating should be on, but it only worked occasionally (this is a building from 1890 and the amenities are a bit worn and probably never have been updated). There is an extra heater but it is not sufficient to heat up the room cause the ceiling is high and the glas roof is not a good insulation. Consequently for the majority of the time the temperature inside was between (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) C) which was disagreeable. Second point was the noise from 3 construction sites in the street, one just opposite the building. They started work early and the clearing of rubble was sometimes done past midnight and very loud. Once the heating problem is sorted out and the construction is done it will be a nice place to stay."

2595,223658531,1/1/18,66056138,Blake,Great place. Would definitely recommend! Jennifer is really sweet and easy going.
2595,258747537,29/4/18,128182033,Natalie,"We really enjoyed our stay at Jennifer’s apartment. She was very hospitable and answered any questions we had promptly. The hike up the four flights of stairs with the luggage was a challenge. 
The location was amazing. Central to everything, 5 min walk to the subway, close to time square. There was a bit of noise at night from all the construction happening around the apartment but Jennifer supplied us with ear plugs which worked a treat. Would highly recommend her apartment"
2595,265850774,18/5/18,11496712,Peter,This apartment is convenient and functional.  The huge skylight makes it feel open and airy. And it is located smack dab in the middle of Manhattan.  Highly recommended.
2595,269561173,27/5/18,76998885,Laura,The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city.  Truly a sanctuary with everything you need. Little touches of nature and beauty throughout. Waking up with the sun from the skylight was amazing. 
2595,273575493,6/6/18,115721479,Sara,"Jennifer is very nice and responsive. The location of the apt is great. However 
- the bed was small and smelly. The apt also smelled weird. We had to sleep on a mattress on the floor
- the building is very old. 
- the apt is not clean and due to construction it was very noisy. 

However. We do appreciate the stay and the location"
2595,283276097,29/6/18,51923495,Fabiola,"Jennifer es un anfitrión increíble. Siempre estuvo comunicada y dejó listos todos los detalles para que mi estancia fuera perfecta. Me sentí como en casa.
El departamento es maravilloso, con mucha luz y una sensación de tranquilidad, además de una ubicación inmejorable, justo en el centro de Manhattan!! A unos pasos del Empire State. Totalmente recomendable!!"
3330,23062,4/1/10,25341,David,"I haven't met Julia but her place is very nice and comfortable. The location is great - just a 15 min train ride to Manhattan. Within walking distance, there are many shops, restaurants and supermarkets. The busy main street of Williamsburg (Bedford Avenue) is just a few subway stations away."
3330,41260,9/5/10,114532,Francesca,Julia's room is lovely. Very light and bright. Jae made us feel very welcome and it was really cool to sit out on the roof and enjoy the view. Fantastic transport links into Manhattan. We'd definitely stay again!
3330,61416,5/7/10,153167,Giovanni,"We had a confortable stay. The room is really nice and bright. The location is perfect, not to busy as in Manhattan but only few stops away from the living areas. It's only 5min from Bedford av. (nice bars, restaurants and shops) and a few minutes more from Manhattan. Jae made us feel welcome and gave us good suggestions. We hope that next time we will have more time to see you and have a drink.
Thanks again."
3330,113729,7/10/10,213554,Amaury,thx J & J for having us. it all worked out just fine. looking forward to see the Ugly Original colection on-line btw :-)  hope to meet you 2 next time! ciao for now. Amaury & Giovanni
3330,141726,20/11/10,250953,Denise,"Julia and Jae are the loveliest hosts I've ever had.
Me and my boyfriend spent a few weeks in their apartment and it felt like we had known each other forever. The place is clean and tidy. We were free to use the living room and the kitchen. Our room was very tidy and clean upon our arrival. There was clean sheets on the bed and some freshly washed towels. The bed is super comfy. You can do your laundry downstairs in the cellar. If you're the kind of person who likes to have your privacy you will be very happy here since the hosts are at times barely at home and if they are they won't throw big parties and they will respect your privacy. However, if they are at home they will be happy to give you advice on getting around in NYC and tell you about lovely restaurants and other things to do and places to visit. The apartment is located very close to the L train so it only takes about 10-15 minutes to get into Manhattan. Jae took me to some lovely restaurants and bars in the neighborhood. We've become good friends with Julia and Jae and we'll definitely stay in touch. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING JULIA AND JAE!!! We hope to see you soon again. D&S"
3330,207792,23/3/11,397302,Rachel-Nicole,The host canceled my reservation 7 days before arrival.
3330,210675,28/3/11,380321,Anna,"My boyfriend and I spent 6 days in Julia's apartment. The apartment is really pretty and clean, as is the room; the bed super comfortable, lots of space in drawers to put away clothes etc. The subway is only 3 mins away (great!), the housemate really nice - 5 stars to ""Ugly Original"" - just a shame we never got to meet Julia herself!! Everything went very smooth, from booking to getting there to receiving keys. We highly recommend this place, and hope to hear from Julia if ever she comes to Sweden/Denmark :)"
3330,833806,3/1/12,993316,Maya,Julia's BK Lodge was wonderful! Great apartment in a great location. The place was clean and comfortable. We didn't see Julia during our stay but we met Julia's roommate and her dog - who we rarely saw as well. I would definitely consider staying here again to take advantage of their rooftop patio. It was a great place to call home for a week. Thanks Julia!
3330,15188638,4/7/14,4265869,Jeff,Awesome hosts. Awesome apartment. My own private rooftop deck overlooking Manhattan.  What more could you want?
3330,18669281,30/8/14,19158719,Mike And Kathryn,"Julia's place was as advertised; comfortable, in a good location, and with an outstanding rooftop. There is plenty to see/do in the surrounding neighbourhoods (e.g. great street art, excellent food) and getting into Manhattan is quick & easy.
Didn't see much of Julia as we were coming and going at different hours but she was a friendly & courteous host. "
3330,22061861,29/10/14,14579449,Laura,The host made me feel very welcome when I arrived at the apartment. The place was really clean and the room itself was wonderful. I felt very welcome and truly enjoyed my stay there. I would recommend staying at this apartment to anyone. The area is really nice and the subway literally right round the corner! Great shops near by too. Thank you for having me for my 2 months!
3330,24890239,3/1/15,25128121,Daniel,"Julia and company are great hosts! The apartment is in a good location, convenient to mass transit as well as the Williamsburg bridge to Manhattan.  The room is a good size, the light from outside is lovely and the bathroom is clean with a nice bathtub/shower."
3330,29310974,6/4/15,2192515,Tina,"Julia's apartment was exactly like in the ad.  Her apartment was located in a friendly neighbourhood in Williamsburg, a few minute walk from the subway.  Julia provided clear directions to get to her place as well as some recommendations of local favourites. 

Julia's room was on the second floor of the apartment, with its own bathroom and access to the rooftop.  Her room was clean and decorative.  Julia was out of town the weekend we stayed over, but she was helpful and checked in on us even while she was away.

 My friend and I really enjoyed our three night stay at Julia's place.  We would definitely recommend staying at Julia's place."
3330,30348643,20/4/15,8859564,Jamie,"Staying at Julia's place was pretty wonderful: super spacious and clean space, amazing rooftop view of city, and a still authentic part of Williamsburg with some neighborhood gems (vegan doughnuts, artisan coffee, and a few hip neighborhood cafés/bars). Easy access to the city (metro or urban hiking), and a 24 hr. organic convenience store around the corner."
3330,31183185,3/5/15,16869818,Sharon,"Julia stayed in constant contact with us before we arrived at the apartment and was super friendly and helpful.  The room was exactly as described on the site and we had amazing views of Manhattan from the roof-top balcony.  We felt like it was our own private apartment as the room was quite spacious, we could make use of the balcony for breakfast and the bathroom is on the same floor and is private.  We had an awesome stay in Brooklyn and are looking forward to our next visit to NYC!"
3330,32512878,19/5/15,4057839,Becca,Julia was communicative and she lives in a great area. She was helpful and great to work with the entire time. Thanks Julia!
3330,48496996,27/9/15,22861740,Angela,Julia was a great host and she was also to show me the place before she left. The location was great and really close to the L train. The other roommates were also great. 
3330,52402859,29/10/15,1918105,Erika,"Julia and Jae are such welcoming, friendly people and their place is just great. We had an amazing time and would definitely stay there again!

The space is huge and the view is breathtaking. Everything – the room, the bathroom, the shared kitchen – is clean and fresh. Julia and Jae work a lot, but when they’re home, they’re super nice to hang out with. We had a lot of fun with them and also really appreciated the list of neighborhood gems Julia sent us before our arrival and all the cool bar tips Jae shared with us. 

We totally fell in love with the neighborhood, which feels really safe and is close to just about everything. The subway is just around the corner and the area is full of nice bars, restaurants and more. 

Both Julia and Jae were really helpful and Julia gave us all information we could possibly need before our arrival in Brooklyn. Everything just went smooth! 

Thank you so much, Julia and Jae! We hope to see you soon again!"
3330,55610780,3/12/15,24206473,Gustavo,"Unfortunately we didn't meet Julia personally during our stay, but at the moment we booked her room she was very helpful and kind. We met her roommate Adriana, who's also a great person and made us feel home.
The apartment is very clean, comfortable and quiet. We were impressed with the style.
The neighborhood is full of services and places to eat, in a few steps. 
We would love to stay there again, for sure!!"
3330,87483258,20/7/16,1918105,Erika,"This was our second time staying with Julia and once again – we loved it! The apartment is clean and just beautiful, in a cool and safe neighborhood, very close to the subway. The room is big, has a great rooftop of its own and a separate bathroom, which is perfect for us. 
Julia is a wonderful host; welcoming, helpful and really friendly. She let us both have our privacy and hang out with her, when there was time. 
We look forward to staying with Julia again!

The bedroom is big, neat and clean and has a private bathroom and a private rooftop with an incredible view. The neighbourhood is quite and has some groceries, delis and cafes nearby. I would highly recommend it! "

3330,105142183,30/9/16,13302565,Ola,"We stayed at Julia's place for 9 days. The building is like 2 min walk from L subway line. The neighbourhood is safe, we were only two girls there, everyday we came home alone around 1AM and we never experienced anything dangerous. There is a lift in the building, so you don't have to carry your heavy luggage on the 4th floor ;-) The room looks nice, exactly the same as on photos. It's quite big, clean, with clean private bathroom and entrance to the rooftop. Julia is a very nice and positive person. Even though we spent whole days visiting the city, we were in touch with her via (Hidden by Airbnb) . We highly recommend that place and the NYC! "
3330,201559935,8/10/17,96059360,Bea,"My boyfriend and I spent a wonderful week in NYC for the first time and we decided to stay in Julia's house because the good location but, above all, for the greats reviews of the previous guests but was better than we expected!!
For the first time, she was really helpful with us both before and during the us stay. 
The house is very nice with a great location in a cute area of Brooklyn with easy connections to go anywhere with the L train and with plenty of places around to have some breakfast (like bagles in ""Bread brothers bagel cafe"" or donuts in ""Dunn Well"", (recommended by Julia and very appreciate cause was delicious!) or launch and dinner. 
The bed is super confortable and the room so spacious and has a private bathroom. It has a terrace as well, from where we could enjoy the lovely views of the skyline of Manhattan. 
We felt extremely fortunate to have found this place and definitely, if we repeat NY at destiny, we will choice Julia's house again!!"
3330,204081092,16/10/17,23300977,Mathieu,"Une semaine magnifique à New York chez Julia. Les indications qu’elle nous a laissé par mail avant notre arrivée étaient détaillées, complètes et nous ont permis de passer un agréable séjour chez elle. A noter que nous avons eu l’occasion de la rencontrer que le dernier jour, au moment du départ, lorsqu’elle rentrait de ses vacances à l'étranger. Nous n'avons pas rencontré son autre colocataire, mais avons fait la connaissance d'un couple qui louait pour la semaine la 3ème chambre de l'appartement. Même si nous n’avons pas utilisé la cuisine, celle-ci semblait fort bien équipée. Le salon est petit et joli. On accède à notre chambre par le petit escalier en fer dans le salon. Il s’agit d'une pièce accueillante et propre, grande (bien assez de place pour poser plusieurs bagages. La chambre donne directement sur un rooftop, que nous avons beaucoup utilisé le soir en rentrant ou pour boire un café le matin. Une salle de bain privative avec baignoire se trouve également à cet étage. Le quartier est très sympa et proche de Manhattan. L’appartement est à 3min à pied de station la station Montrose de la ligne L. Bref, on recommande chaudement. Sauf peut-être pour les personnes qui souhaitent se réveiller au milieu des buildings ;)"
3330,218427914,12/12/17,110890166,Caitlin,"If you’re looking at this place; book it! Julia’s place was such a great spot! Julia was so lovely and communication was second to none! She was extremely helpful and answered any and all questions! The place was in a great spot, super close to the subway (<5mins walk), close to great food and bars/everything you could ever want/need! The place was clean and fully equipped with everything! Couldn’t recommend this place enough and will be staying here next time I’m in NYC! Thanks so much Julia :)"
3330,247196451,27/3/18,27710096,Stella,"I spent 3 months in this amazing accomodation. Julia is a lovely, helpful and caring person. The apartment is really nice, new, clean. As well as the building. The area is the best one in the whole City of New York. Really young but also quite and safe. It is close to Union Square, that it is the center of the world, and the train stop is 3 minutes walking far. You can find everything around there: good and fashion restaurants, cheap places to get brunch, lunch or whatever with good food, groceries, shops, vintage markets. But the apartment is quite, you can get the best sleep ever, thanks to the silence and the comfortable pillows and matressess. The apartment has 3 rooms. 2 downstairs with a nice bathroom, and one (penthouse) upstairs. This one, that I rented, is huge, well decorated, with its own private bathroom and, the best part, it has an amazing view thanks to an huge terrace. Julia provides everything for your need and she is always in touch for any need. Wifi free and very fast, the living room is very nice and comfortable. The kitchen is full of everything you might need to cook.  It's impossible to leave a negative comment about her and her place. If this happens is because of dirty or unpolite guests. Because this is Just perfect.

I am looking forward to come back to Nyc soon and I will stay there again. I've been more than  once in Nyc and I can tell you that this is an awesome solution for a comfortable and unforgettable stay. Thanks Julia! Love you! And I am missing you and your room already! See you soon"
3330,252439365,10/4/18,135657248,Priscila,"O apartamento é muito bom! Não poderíamos ter feito uma escolha melhor para nossos 13 dias em Nova York. Quarto grande, limpo e confortável. Ótima área externa com uma linda vista de Manhattan. Cama super confortável, excelente pra descansar depois de um longo dia de caminhadas por NYC. Super bem localizado, a linha L fica a 1 minuto de caminhada do apartamento. Várias opções de delis e pizza por perto - não posso deixar de recomendar o mercado Azure (sanduíches muito bons com preços justos). O bairro é muito agradável, seguro e silencioso. A Julia foi uma host maravilhosa, nos deu um excelente suporte durante todo o tempo mesmo antes de confirmarmos a reserva. Nossa primeira experiência com o Airbnb foi sensacional graças a ela. Sem dúvidas recomendamos o apartamento e adoraríamos ficar lá novamente!"

The room is great with the most comfortable bed we ever slept in, a private bathroom and a big rooftop deck to yourself with impressive views. The area around the apartment is very nice , it's right next to a subway station (1 min walk) and only a few stops away from Bedford Avenue and Manhattan. Julia was great, helpful and responsive at all times. We would totally recommend this place !!"

3831,22232975,2/11/14,6050386,Monica,"The best thing about this place is the location! You're right in the middle of Clinton Hill with easy access to restaurants on Franklin Avenue and in Fort Greene. You're also close to the C and G trains, so transportation is easy. 
The space is clean and neat, if spare. It really is much more of a one-floor apartment than a private room, as you will only have interactions with the family on the shared stairs and stoop. There is, however, no door at the top of the stairs so sounds travel from the rest of the house. Lisa-Roxanne was kind and accommodating, and the children are adorable!"

There were a lot of thoughtful details as well, like spare toothbrushes, coffee, creamer etc. One of the things I was worried about in NYC was parking, and there was plenty of on street parking. There was a market on the corner. The house is currently being renovated so chances are you will find it even better when you go. My wife and I had a great time, she especially loved her surprise! "

But the place is very clean and tidy, the bed sleeps wonderful and LisaRoxanne and her husband are wonderful people doing all they can to make you feel comfortable. Special plus for us: We had our one-and-a-half-year-old kid with us and that was no problem whatsoever. If you go to NYC, stay there - you are in the best hands!"

The space was clean and neighborhood felt safe.  On-street parking was plentiful on the weekend.  She and her family were there throughout the time we were there and being on the top floor there was enough separation and privacy that it was not a problem.  She was very accommodating and gracious when we had a last minute addition, needing an additional bed.  Great value --  I highly recommend!"
3831,53807846,13/11/15,40990450,Maria,"Neighborhood was safe, close to subway, space was great and just what we needed.  It was way better than a small hotel room.  Lisa Roxanne was very accommodating for our group of 2 adults and 4 children, even provided extra air mattress.  Would definitely stay again.  "
3831,56589139,15/12/15,8741356,Martin,"I quickly felt at home in Lisa Roxanne's home. The top floor is part of the house but I always felt that I had privacy and could get on with what I had to do. Anything that I felt missing in the kitchen was quickly organised as soon as I asked for it. Lisa responds extremely quickly to any message on AirBnb and helps with the issues that comes up. She did call me a car service this morning for me to go to JFK. Very helpful!
The area is up and coming and has good restaurants and a nice vibe. I would live there again without hesitation.
"
3831,56859865,19/12/15,14401938,Meg,"We enjoyed our brief stay. Lisa was wonderful, answering messages and accomodating our arrival even when we were several hours later than anticipated. We would definitely stay here again"
3831,57282004,24/12/15,1321528,Sandy,"We enjoyed staying at Lisa Roxanne's place. The place was spacious, clean, and easy to find. Lisa Roxanne was extremely accommodating, allowing us to store our bags before check-in time. The bed was very comfortable. It was a very good experience all around."
3831,57395293,25/12/15,32710523,Scott,"Arrived Dec 24th around 4:30pm which we had just finished visiting the Jehovahs Witnesses Head Quarters. The location to the Airbnb was very easy to find as well as the parking which is on Gates ave. Lisa was a very kind and hospitable person she greeted us at the door and showed us to our room as well as gave us directions to the nearest subway (G On Lafayette and Classon Abe) and restaurants which are really close walking distance even. The accommodation was perfect 2 beds and a comfy cot which fit 3 people in the top floor of the 3 story brownstone, there was a kitchen which included a stove, microwave and refrigerator as well as a dining table to sit and eat. The bathroom was very clean and Lisa provide us with towels, toothbrushes and toothpaste as well as soap and shampoo in the shower which was very thoughtful. The neighborhood was fairly quiet and safe. If the subway is not your thing there are city bikes a few blocks up on Lexington ave. Overall we are deeply appreciative of Lisa's hospitality, we would totally recommend this place and we hope you have a wonderful stay. Thank you."
3831,58117165,1/1/16,36381492,Ciara,This was my first time using Airbnb and we had a wonderful time staying with Lisa! The neighborhood was as described and I never felt unsafe walking around at anytime. Lisa also gave us a guidebook of restaurants and bars to try in the area that proved to be very helpful. We met new people at most of the places we went to. Manhattan is about a 40 minute subway ride so plan for that if you do decide to stay here.
3831,58851986,5/1/16,35253952,Matthew,"The location is great, 6 blocks to two different subway stops/trains that's less than 30 mins to Manhattan. Neighborhood is pretty quiet and many places being updated in the area. I was a little apprehensive about the arrangement of sharing a house but the layout of the house is such it's not an issue. This is a great value with the kitchen. Lisa made sure we had directions from the airport, which were perfect. I'd recommend staying here. "
3831,59155937,7/1/16,29384335,Hayden,"Had a wonderful time, very cosy and warm compared to the freezing temperatures outside. The host even baked us an amazing red velvet style cake with a picture of us printed on, such a shame we weren't able to finish it. 

Great and simple connections into Manhattan, and even better into Brooklyn and Williamsburg.

Roxanne was lovely, assisted us in directions from Airport and into New York, and she gave us a great time at our flat. Go for it!"
3831,59539298,11/1/16,35220968,Janet,"This good spot is accurately described by a wonderful host. We found ourselves hosted in the heart of the Brooklyn scene with easy access to everything-- great restaurants, public transit, etc.  The space was bright, spotless, and can work for a quick overnight or a longer stay too-- really a nice, peaceful discovery in a bustling and hip corner of New York. "
3831,59908007,17/1/16,39080435,Michelle,My boyfriend and I stayed at LisaRoxanne's place while visiting Brooklyn for the weekend. We had a very nice time. The apartment is clean and we enjoyed the privacy of upstairs. Parking was easy. We walked to to subway a few blocks away and checked out some nice places in walking distance. LisaRoxanne was a great host and was always available by text if we needed anything. Would definitely consider coming back in the future :)
3831,60181560,19/1/16,31838543,Kaylyn,"LisaRoxanne and her husband were great hosts! Very accommodating, and the apartment is located in a great part of town. Thank you so much for having us!"
3831,60327559,22/1/16,22587015,Anibal,I had a relaxed stay at LisaRoxanne place which is what I was looking for. It was easy an easy commute to Manhattan. The area feeled safe. Thanks for letting me stay there.
3831,60464084,24/1/16,45722529,Amalie,"The apartment was just as described, clean, private, and very peaceful! This family is super friendly, offered to help with directions, and made sure I was alright during the blizzard! Highly recommend :) "
3831,60774583,27/1/16,13859280,Peter,Great host!  Great place and plenty of space. Will come back for sure. 
3831,60925349,29/1/16,680798,Ganj,"LisaRox was a fantastic host and both her and her husband were very accommodating. My friend and I arrived late (after midnight) due to unforeseen circumstances, but they were still very welcoming. LisaRox was a wonderful person to talk to, and she helped us find what we were looking for in New York."
3831,61013083,30/1/16,37088111,Ignacio,"Estuvo todo perfecto! El barrio es muy lindo, seguro, con un acceso fácil a todos lados gracias al subway y el alojamiento es muy amplio y cómodo! Estuvimos solo un día, pero Roxanne se preocupó por saber siempre como estabamos. Muy recomendable!"
3831,61130599,31/1/16,56361770,John,"I was made very welcome and the accommodation, comprising the whole top floor (kitchen, bathroom & bedroom), was nice & private.  The bathroom & kitchen were very well-equipped.  The neighborhood had a great bohemian feel - my exact impression of what Brooklyn would be like.  Great bar, restaurant and convenience store a few minutes walk away."
3831,61429629,4/2/16,17844697,Ana Luísa,"The place is small but the room was spacious enough for the three of us. It was also good to have enough space in the kitchen to cook and sit down to eat - we cooked a few times during our stay and the kitchen was simple but had the necessary utensils. Lisa was really helpful during the whole stay, with useful advice about public transport and even getting tickets for a Broadway show. It was overall a good experience!"
3831,62235718,13/2/16,4009741,Daisy,My parents and I visited NYC for 9 days. Lisa was very helpful prior our visit and also during our stay. The place is clean and spacious for three people. And you get the whole 3rd floor for usage so privacy is not an issue at all. Location is convenient. Feel safe even when it's midnight. Recommend!
3831,63373562,22/2/16,21780270,Caroline,"LisaRoxanne was very prompt to get in touch and was very flexible with my arrival time.  She was friendly, welcoming, and helpful with figuring out how to get to the airport on the subway. The apartment was spacious and comfortable and is located in a quiet and convenient  neighborhood. "
3831,63637721,25/2/16,23661247,Pascale,"Super séjour à Brooklyn. L'appartement est bien décrit et très propre. Lisa Roxane à pensé à tout, même à un éventuel oubli de brosse à dents! C'est une hôte gentille, sympa et très disponible.
Pour les bons marcheurs, le quartier est proche de Manhattan par les ponts de Manhattan ou Brooklyn.
Very good trip at Brooklyn. Fit to the description the appartement is very clean. Lisa Roxane is a kind and helpful person."
3831,64501238,5/3/16,20433034,Edwin,"Brilliant host who made us feel welcome without being intrusive. Lisa had a good local knowledge of how to get around the city. The flat was basic but perfect for those who aren't too bothered about luxuries. The kitchen is well stocked with plenty of utensils. The neighbourhood is cool with lots of bars, restaurants and cafes and easy access to the subway. There are also Citibikes located nearby, which are a great way of getting around whilst keeping costs down."
3831,65313439,13/3/16,899646,Nati,"Lisa was very nice. The apartament was just like in the pictures, comfortable and clean. I would stay here again."
3831,65782494,17/3/16,53216926,Nick,"This was my first time using Airbnb and it was a very pleasant experience! Lisa was a great host, with some wonderful food recommendations near her apartment. The apartment was nice and all necessities were provided. You share a common stairway with the rest of the house, but the top floor is very private and secluded. I would definitely recommend Lisa's place to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in NY. Look forward to staying again sometime! "
3831,66362016,22/3/16,50050762,Oscar,"Brilliant host, clean and comfortable apartment in a good location. Cake was great too!"
3831,66710754,24/3/16,56773005,Elizabeth,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and she was extremely helpful from day one. The room was extremely nice and she was willing to give us pointers on where to eat and how to get to some of the places we wanted to go. Definitely would recommend. "
3831,68291711,4/4/16,49019892,Mark Stephen,"i had a pleasant stay at Lisa's place. its very silent, comfortable and clean. it has easy access to many places.  Lisa gave me a cake for my bday. she is very open to questions and always ready to help. "
3831,69193192,10/4/16,48390970,Michelle,"L'appartement est tel que décrit , propre et agréable. Pas très loin du métro , dans un quartier tranquille .
La chambre est assez spacieuse pour trois personnes, la cuisine fonctionnelle, la salle de bain également ( Lisa a même pensé aux brosses à dents!!)
Notre hôte, LisaRoxane a été charmante, discrète et accommodante pour notre départ tardif.nous avons pu laisser nos bagages et nous changer avant de prendre un taxi pour JFK.
Tout était très bien, nous avons passé un excellent sejour!
"
3831,70793307,20/4/16,47764756,Pascal,"Quartier agréable,a 20mn de métro de manhattan,nécessaire de toilette avec le plus (brosse a dents). Bien juste pour dormir,pour 3,pour 4 un peux petit."
3831,71590505,26/4/16,35284339,Françoise,Quartier très calme et agréable. L'appartement était conforme à la description avec une cuisine équipée pour se reposer des repas dehors. LisaRoxanne était très sympathique. Un petit effort de restauration vaudrait la peine pour valoriser cet appartement historique. Deux points à améliorer : le troisième lit pas confortable et la propreté générale défaillante.
3831,72977733,6/5/16,50070041,Ruth,"Dear LisaRoxanne, 
Thank you for your hospitality and your lovely cake. My daughter and I had a wonderful time in New York.  Hope to stay again at your place."
3831,73798905,10/5/16,15036895,Noémie,"Le logement est conforme aux photos et très agréable! LisaRoxanne et son mari sont adorables, le séjour d une nuit s est très bien passé!"
3831,76060282,24/5/16,45081199,Friedhelm,"We were 2 weeks to guest at Lisa Roxanne. We liked it very well. The apartment was as described. the access to the metro was very good. The quarter was safe and the people were very friendly. Supermarket and restaurants were near.
The apartment was very clean and there was coffee, coffee filter, iron and a hairdryer. Lisa Roxanne and her family are lovely people. She was very helpful and gave good tips. On our next visit to New York we will be happy to stay there again.
At birthday, there was a very great cake. it was a big surprise.
Lisa Roxanne and her family are great people."
3831,76636487,28/5/16,13380694,Sofia,"The floor is really nice, clean, very well located and has everything you need!   LisaRoxanne is very helpful, she really makes a lot for the guests and she is very flexible with the hours of arrival and departure.  "
3831,76748722,29/5/16,7039087,Kirill,We stayed only for one night and are well rested before the flight. LisaRoxanne did everything to make us feel at home. Thanks for the hospitality!
3831,77539468,1/6/16,27182932,Roy,"We had a great stay here! We had all the amenities we needed. It was a warm week in New York, but there was a fan that we were able to use to keep the space cool. The neighborhood was very nice and it was an easy walk to some great bakeries and the subway. "
3831,78602436,7/6/16,24518187,Rachel,"This place is fantastic, LisaRoxanne was an exceptional host and was very helpful with providing information including directions and recommendations for restaurants.  The private floor is essentially it's own apartment with all of the amenities you need, the neighborhood is lovely and quiet and has great restaurants and is close enough to public transportation to make everything pretty accessible.  We had a great stay and would definitely return! "
3831,80500310,18/6/16,19847715,France,"Lisa Roxanne nous a très bien reçus. Elle est très serviable et a pris le temps de nous expliquer comment aller à Manhattan. Elle nous a même imprimé des itinéraires. Il faut compter 30 à 40 minutes pour rejoindre Manhattan. Le métro est à 10 min. à pied du logement. Le quartier où se situe le logement est agréable, de très belles maisons dans le coin."
3831,81716748,24/6/16,33102130,Tamas,"We felt welcome and treated well. Neighbourhood is listed officially not very safe but we didn't have any issues with people on the streets. It's quite relaxed family oriented area, churches and schools around.
The apartment has everything one would need from such place to rent.
The bed was really comfy, even better than in most of the hotels we have ever stayed and let's face it that is the most important part.

Our discomfort was the smell of cigarettes that came up from downstairs and that the floor is only separated by stairs so the noise of the kids and constantly ongoing TV feels very present and not private at all as it makes you feel that your average activities are just as audible for your hosts as they are for you. Not romantic at all if you know what I mean...
In over all it was a good stay but only recommend it if you want to be out most of the time and you need a place that has absolutely everything for the short time you spend there in the evenings and mornings. 
4 stars from me."
3831,84175631,5/7/16,2099743,Angel,We had a good time staying at LisaRoxanne's place. We didn't spend too much time in the apartment but the stay was pleasant. She was very good at communicating and even set up the rollaway bed for my friend. The apartment is just as pictured and has all the amenities that you'll need. 
3831,85877370,13/7/16,2099230,Gonda,"LisaRoxanne was at home when we arrived and helped us with everything, including infomation to the neighborhood. The house is in a quiet street close to the subway and right next to a bus stop.
Our room (with a/c) with private bathroom (towels, toothpaste, shampoo.. was provided) and kitchen was upstairs. But if you are able (like us) to walk some steps it is the perfect place to stay. 
Since part of the subway was under construction during our stay, we sometimes took the bus to a bigger subway station (Jay or Hoyt).
Lisa Roxanne provided us the most beautiful birthday cake with pictures of the skyline of Manhanttan. Thanks again.
LisaRoxanne can organize transprotation from and to the airport. We didn't need it this time, but this can be very helpful. "

3831,90620550,1/8/16,13227965,Virginie,"Great stay at Liz's apartment. The place was clean, quiet and full equipped. Liz is a wonderful host communicating and checking if her guests are having a good time. Will come back for sure. Thanks!"
3831,91204004,4/8/16,10565650,Michael,Great place in an authentic and fun NYC-neighborhood. Public transportation is easily accessible. Definitely recommend it! 
3831,95427753,19/8/16,50099278,Sophie,"Lisa nous attendait et m'avez indiqué les directions dans le Air train. Le quartier est accessible très facilement. Il est sympa. On s' y sent bien. Loin de l'agitation de Manhattan, et proche par le métro, tout au plus 30mn. Nous avons découvert cette ville Extraordinaire qu'est New-York, également à travers ce quartier de Brooklyn. "
3831,97066031,25/8/16,22689363,Marco Franco Maria,"La padrona di casa è stata precisissimo nelle comunicazioni e veloce nelle risposte (l unico ritardo è stato causato da un problema con l app per cui io non vedevo le risposte). Lisa è sempre stata disponibile a darci informazioni e verso le nostre esigenze. L alloggio è funzionale e pulito. Si accede attraverso una scala un Po stretta,(se si hanno problemi di mobilita potrebbe essere un problema) ma noi non abbiamo avuto problemi. Il  bagno è nuovo appena ristrutturato. La cucina è funzionante con l occorrente per preparare un semplice pasto. I letti sono comodi e le stanze abbastanza grandi dove mettere le valigie e i vestiti. Lenzuola e asciugamani puliti e in ottimo stato.Per correttezza di recensione senza nulla togliere l'alloggio, nelle foto sembra migliore con rifiniture più accurate, ma ripeto pulito e funzionale. L aria condizionata funziona a dovere e il WI FI  funzionale benissimo. Il quartiere sembra un Po trascurato, ma sembra sicuro,noi siamo rientrati anche a tarda sera senza mai avere sensazioni di pericolo o insicurezza. Nelle vicinanze sulla Franklin vi sono supermercati, negli isolati adiacenti vi sono piccoli negoziati aperti fino a tardi. La metropolitana si trova a 10 minuti. Nei dintorni vi sono diverse linee di bus. Ringraziamo Lisa per l ospitalità. Ci torneremo e lo consiglierei ad amici che vogliano visitare NY senza spendere una fortuna consapevoli di non essere in un hotel a 4 stelle. Consigliato "
3831,100031098,7/9/16,69171173,Cassandra,Nice place with access to Metro bus within feet of the front door. Friendly neighborhood with plenty of places to eat or shop within walking distance.  
3831,101738201,15/9/16,34009659,Lukas,"Everything went perfect. Good room, good WiFi, no problems or anything to complain about at all."
3831,103161516,20/9/16,5642090,David,LisaRoxanne was very accommodating. We like being in a non-tourist neighborhood and this fit the bill.  Glad there is an air conditioner in the bedroom!
3831,104997515,29/9/16,52676429,Andrew,Close to subway in leafy street.
3831,106031325,3/10/16,52909749,Ed,"LisaRoxanne met us when we arrived and gave us our keys - she showed us around and then let us be, which was just great. LisaRoxanne gave us privacy and we came & went as we pleased. The neighbourhood is great with lots of local food options - however it is on the flight path & the buses make it a bit noisy. We also hadn't realised that the trip in/out of Manhatten each day was fairly time consuming - in essence it gave us a great opportunity to see 'normal' life & we would never have gone to Brooklyn otherwise - which we really enjoyed - however as 'tourists' it was a trek in/out of the city

The accommodation was perfectly adequate for what we needed - good amenities - lisaRoxanne even thought to leave us a couple of umbrellas which was well appreciated - eating in would have been really easy but with NYC on the doorstep, why would you? 

Thanks & goodluck LisaRoxanne "
3831,106175332,4/10/16,77750040,Annje,"Alles war supersauber und nett hergerichtet. Die Nachbarschaft ist gemischt, teilweise chic, teilweise weniger, aber nicht unsicher. Perfekte Lage zur U-Bahn ca. 5 Min. Guter Bäcker azf dem Weg dorthin."
3831,106737495,7/10/16,6661413,Laura,"We had a great stay at LisaRoxanne's place when we stayed for 3 nights in October. The apartment is relatively well located for the subway (less than 10 mins walk) and was equipped as shown in the pictures. Short walk to a few coffee shops/restaurants/bars. The living area had a good wifi connection, the bed was big and comfy and the bedroom was very spacious with A/C.  The only thing to bear in mind, as another reviewer has noted, is that even though the guest area occupies the whole of the top floor of the building there is no dividing wall or door for the area - other than the bedroom door.  This doesn't cause any major problems but it does mean that noise from the family living area below travels up the stairs more easily and has a feeling of the area not being completely private - although this was just a feeling as we had sole use of the top floor. LisaRoxanne was a friendly and responsive host before and during our stay."
3831,107304979,9/10/16,21232644,Steve,"Super great location for our needs
The space was wide open and offered everything we needed would stay again"
3831,107843460,12/10/16,2708447,Sandy,"Lisa was Awesome and her place was Great. We decided to spend a little time in New York and couldn't have asked for a better place. Lisa was kind enough to call us a taxi and recommend a play for us. She even took the time to find us some great priced tickets for a show. Her husband does Uber part time, so that is an extra convenience for you. 
Thank You Lisa for all you did and those homemade cookies were delicious!!!"
3831,108110432,14/10/16,84162159,Lety,"Lisa's place is very nice and clean, the neighborhood is very quiet and the subway is really close.

3831,110674880,27/10/16,23265396,Daniela,"My friend and I spent almost 2 weeks at LisaRoxanne's place and really enjoyed it. The bedroom and the kitchen are pretty spacious compared to other apartments and the bed is extremely comfortable. 
I only met LisaRoxanne twice and she was very easy to communicate with and nice. When we had questions we messaged her and she always responded very quickly. She even provided us with beach towels because we did not expect it to be so warm in October. A week later she helped us out with umbrellas.
All in all I would definitely stay at LisaRoxanne's again and recommend her to other New York travelers. We always felt safe and welcome."
3831,111815888,1/11/16,52401767,Paul,"Stopped at Here for 5 nights, loved everything about the place.
LisaRoxanne gives you as much help with all things New York, as you need. 
I would stop hear again 100% 
Many thanks ."

3831,113752495,13/11/16,2402299,Jennifer,"My boyfriend and I loved staying with LisaRoxanne. Although, we were only there for one night we thought the flat was perfect and spacious. It is located in one of my favorite neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Clinton Hill. You have access to a full-kitchen, great bathroom and very comfortable bed. I could not have asked for a better stay. One of my best Airbnb spaces to-date!"
3831,113950333,14/11/16,98835140,Ad,"We loved our stay at Lisa's, she was extreamely helpful, offered to drive my wife to her interview, helped move our car for street cleaning, saved us a parking spot. it was just more than a stay we felt like part of her extended family. Would definitely recommend Lisa's place if you are planning to stay around ny area. The place is very spacious, well lit, cozy and safe."
3831,114078229,15/11/16,91530156,Nicholas,"LisaRoxanne is a warm and helpful host, and the apartment is clean and comfortable. The price is also very affordable. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Brooklyn."

The neighbourhood is nice and there is an area of lots of shops and resteraunts in walking distance which towards the end of our trip we preferred to Manhattan. To go into the city is really easy by Train. "
3831,117267326,5/12/16,52315368,Vanessa,"Wir haben sieben Tage bei Lisa Roxanne & ihrer Familie gewohnt. Wir haben uns dort sehr wohl gefühlt. Die oberste Etage, mit Küche, Bad & Schlafzimmer hat man komplett für sich alleine & man kann kommen und gehen wie man möchte. Man bekommt zwar geräuschmäsig schon etwas von der Familie mit, allerdings hat uns in unserem Privatbereich nie jemand gestört. Zudem war bei unserer Ankunft alles sehr sauber. Zur Metro sind es nur wenige Gehminuten & von dort aus ist man in ca. 25 Minuten direkt in Manhattan. Wer also einen günstigen Aufenthalt in New York verbringen möchte & bereit ist auch ein bisschen zu fahren, für den ist es die perfekte Unterkunft.:-)"
3831,120218080,8/12/16,67566248,Karsten Swen,Gute Lage. Sehr guter Preis. Wir konnten bei der An und Abreise noch in ihrem Wohnzimmer warten da wir zu früh waren. Sie hat uns eine schöne Übersicht gegeben mit der man sich gut zurechtfindet.
3831,120323460,9/12/16,53229563,Robin,LisaRoxanne was very nice and outgoing.  She is a very pleasant person and respected our privacy while we were there.  
3831,121574204,17/12/16,52638036,Samira,"Wir haben 8 Nächte in Lisas Unterkunft verbracht. Sie war immer sehr aufmerksam und zuvorkommend zu uns, hat mehrfach nachgefragt, ob alles in Ordnung ist und irgendetwas gebraucht wird. Zu Beginn erklärte sie uns die Umgebung und gab uns Tipps zum Einkaufen und für Bars/Cafés in Brooklyn. Fußläufig sind verschiedene U-Bahn-Stationen gut erreichbar, die nach Manhattan führen.

Da sich die Unterkunft in der obersten Etage des Einfamilienhauses befindet, hat man seinen eigenen Bereich mit Schlafzimmer, Bad und Küche, bekommt aber das Leben der Familie akustisch mit. Man erreicht die oberste Etage über das normale Treppenhaus, es gibt keine ""eigene"" Tür, die den Bereich vom restlichen Wohnhaus trennt.
Bad, Küche und Schlafzimmer sind sehr sauber. Handtücher, Fön etc. stehen zur Verfügung, die Küche ist gut ausgestattet.
Für unsere Reise war die Unterkunft eine gute Wahl."
3831,121897195,19/12/16,23218875,Yann,Our stay in Brooklyn was comfortable and friendly. LisaRoxanne and her family warmly welcomed us and we had everything we needed including pancake mix and delicious coffee. We have a 3 year old son and he had his own twin bed with clean linens. She was flexible on the check in/check out times and reserved us a car to the airport. Great stay!
3831,125094225,3/1/17,30194708,Ioana,LisaRoxanne is a wonderful host and will go out of her way to make your stay memorable. The accomodation has all that you may need and the subway and shops are around 10 minutes away.
3831,125978170,8/1/17,26443839,Nicole,The stay was awesome.  Lisa was very generous with tips and information to make the most out of our stay. The place is bigger than the pictures made it seem.  It was very clean and smelled freshly scrubbed.  It's close to the subway and a nice neighborhood
3831,126653446,13/1/17,22890401,Robert,"The place was exactly as described, and great! Lisa was very helpful and communicative, and even let us check in early after a red eye flight into NYC. Well located to explore many neighborhoods of Brooklyn and get to Manhattan and Queens."
3831,129451521,30/1/17,68168880,Agustina,"We stayed at Lisa home for almost three weeks and we had an amazing time. 
The kitchen and bathroom were brand new and fully equipped (she even left new toothbrushes for us!), the bedroom had three beds and we still were super comfortable. 
She received every package we sent, some of which arrived before us, with no complaints and changed our sheets and towels every week. 
There are kids in the house. We didn't care about the occasional noise but if it's something that bothers you, you maybe should take that into account. Overall we have absolutely no complaints! 
"
3831,129803108,2/2/17,70321424,Yuanlin,"It is a nice stay. Lisa is very helpful. She recommends a good restaurant to us and print NBA match tickets for us. Highly recommend.

"
3831,130808624,8/2/17,131005,Monia,LisaRoxanne is a lovely person. However her listing description is not accurate. The set up is odd as it is actually inside their home. It is not a private apt/space and therefore should not be advertised as such. There is one key to the building's main entrance downstairs and that is it. The space does not have a front door you can lock when you leave for the day. You can hear the host family clearly as they are right down a few step (interior staircase). 
3831,131252030,11/2/17,44430509,Charlie,"Great place to stay on a budget! LisaRoxanne was friendly and accommodating. Plenty of beds and overnight materials for up to 5 guests, but know it's one bedroom and one kitchen/bathroom area on the top floor of their home, so it's not exactly the most private place to stay, but we were absolutely given our space and could easily come and go as we wished."
3831,132441463,17/2/17,29683319,Hannah,Our stay was absolutely perfect. We loved being in a fantastic area of Brooklyn. It was really easy to get into the city everyday. The apartment was spotless and we had our own little kitchen to make breakfast on a morning. LisaRoxanne was friendly and had helpfully printed us lots of useful travel instructions and local eateries. And it was easily the cheapest room available for miles! Thanks very much 
3831,133096594,20/2/17,393780,Marita,"Perfect spot for us this long weekend. We didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment, but when we were there it was just fine! The bed is comfortable and all the linens were clean. There are some thin curtains that work for privacy and do block some night street light, but not all. The apartment was clean and had all the amenities we needed. It was very quiet and we didn't see anyone except when we checked in. Private enough for us. We heard people occasionally - the family has some kids - but it was just normal living noises. The check-in was flexible. The location is good in terms of being accessible to Brooklyn and Manhatten. It was easy to get anywhere by car (or transit). We were able to get to Prospect Park very easily and it is close to transit lines, although we didn't use transit as we had our dog. The neighbourhood was pretty quiet and felt safe. Close to Clinton Hill. Great to be dog friendly for us! Would stay again. "
3831,133456752,22/2/17,20622469,Katie,"LisaRoxanne's place was just what we needed after a long flight. Comfortable, clean, close to several restaurants. "
3831,133957163,25/2/17,81668044,Dani,"We stayed 4 days at LisaRoxanne's house and it was a very good time.
The rooms are in the second floor and we had our own kitchen so if you want you can cook something, there is everything you need for it :)
LisaRoxanne was very helpfull, also for buying tickets for the bus to travell to our next station. Of course we could here the family in the first floor but it was totally okay and not too loud. We definitly would come back if we are going to new york again :)"
3831,135566583,5/3/17,73698537,David,"This is a great place to stay in Brooklyn, with a very welcoming host and family who are very respectful of guests' privacy but also helpful and available as needed. Its terrific value accommodation and effectively comprises a one bedroom flat with a largish bedroom comfortably able to sleep 3 people, nice modenised bathroom and amply equipped kitchen. All this is located at the top of this family Brooklyn brownstone, which does mean using the same front door and staircase as the family but hey this is what airB'nB is all about isn't it? Once you're upstairs you are very much in your own space and self-containned, and the house is mercifully ( we went in late Feb/early March) very warm, and has constant hot water too.
This served us very well as a base for exploring Brooklyn and Manhattan in particular as the brownstone is close to 4 subway stations the nearest two being around 6-8 mins walk and the other two, 10 and 15 mins respectively.
Like most people we tended to go out after an early breakfast and spend the whole day and evening out coming back late to this rather quiet suburban area for a welcome relax and sleep.
All in all: excellent value, great location, terrific hostess well equipped accommodationwith everything you're likely to need for a great holiday in NYC: we stayed for a week and loved every minute!"
3831,135983526,7/3/17,3691429,Kathy,"LisaRoxanne was a warm and inviting host.  The home is really best for a couple or singles who don't mind sharing a room.  The price was reasonable for what was offered, and it was an easy place from which to get around.
Thanks LisaRoxanne!"
3831,136900481,12/3/17,65033665,Michael,Stayed here for 5 nights in early March with 2 friends. For 3 people who were out and about exploring as much as possible this was a perfect home base to rest up and get back out to the sight seeing.
3831,138996462,22/3/17,15930489,Stefanie,Lisa was great! Arranged local car service from and to JFK for us. Had some easy chats during our stay. The flat is nice and clean. The family has kids - but it was just normal living noises. The location is good and accessible to Brooklyn and Manhatten - it was easy to get anywhere by transit. Neighbourhood was quiet and felt safe. Some nice bars and restaurants in this area.
3831,141317518,2/4/17,42865886,Danielle,"LisaRoxanne was a wonderful host. She was super flexible with our check-in/out times and responsive to all our questions. The location is great--easy walk to several metro lines that get you all around town and into NYC in a reasonable amount of time. It was lovely to come back to this quiet neighborhood after a day of bustle in the city. There are several sweet markets, cafes, and restaurants within walking distance as well. It was nice to have the whole third floor with a full kitchen so you can cook if you like. This was especially handy for breakfast and coffee.  You can hear their sweet kids playing downstairs. It's not intrusive--they really respected our privacy-and it's just normal happy family noise. It was a wonderful stay all around!  Thank you LisaRoxanne!!"
3831,145980375,21/4/17,29683774,Rob,"Nice place to stay, away from hectic Manhattan. The house is old but the appartment itself is in een reasonable state. Bathroom and kitchen are well taken care of and functioning as they should. The beds are comfortabel and the tv is in working order. WiFi works proper. 
Going to Manhattan is really easy from several options. LisaRoxanne is totally prepared to help you with that. It takes a short subwaytrain to get there. 
When we come back to NYC in the future we would certainly choose for Brooklyn and wouldn't mind staying again at Gates 223! 
Thank you for hosting us,
Rob en Erna"
3831,146115912,21/4/17,1030493,Fernando,"LisaRoxanne is a great host, that offers her place for a great New York experience. The neighborhood is quiet and friendly. Our suggestion: hop on the share bikes and explore the city - it takes you less than 20 minutes from Brooklyn to Manhattan. "
3831,148154612,30/4/17,76155255,Paul,"We had a nice stay. Lisa was verry helpfull with everything. 
A good place near subway, nice resteaurants an shops.

Evertthing worked just fine. "

3831,149662395,5/5/17,111051745,Chris,"We had a lovely time at Lisa's place. Our space was clean and well maintained. She provided a list of to-do, nearby restaurants, and train stations.  Oh, and the cookies were tasty."
3831,149908406,6/5/17,43350009,Danielle,The place was very clean and accurate.  Bed was comfy. I didn't fully utilize the kitchen but I really could with the amount of kitchen ware that was provided. Very clean neighborhood. Overall it was great.
3831,150718429,8/5/17,9989903,Kay,"Nice neighborhood , close to vegetarian vegan gluten free restaurant , near subway.
However there are 30+ steps to climb to get to the third floor where you will be staying."
3831,152604314,17/5/17,3705526,Amanda,"Roxanne's top floor of her brownstone is a perfect way to stay in New York without the HUGE expense of Manhattan prices.  6 blocks from the subway was great.  The leafy street and surrounding area was lovely to walk through each day.  Restaurants and food markets close by to either eat at or buy supplies to eat in.  We would recommend anyone to stay there.  Great kitchen, bathroom is good and the bed extra comfy.  Being on the top floor we didn't hear a lot of passing traffic. Highly recommend this Airbnb. Amanda"
3831,154642583,25/5/17,47481724,Jörg,"Gutes Preis Leistungsverhältnis, Bahn (nach Manhattan) gut 10 Minuten zu Fuß, Bus (Brooklyn) direkt vor der Haustür. Wohnung 2. Etage, recht hellhörig, keine abgetrennten Stockwerke (Schlafzimmer hat aber Tür)."
3831,156863569,1/6/17,87381610,Silvia,"Lisa es una excelente anfitriona. Nos dio indcaciones exactas para que pudieramos conocer Brooklyn. Muy respetuosa de nuestro espacio, Agradable y siempre dispuesta a ayudar. El barrio es tranquilo y la casa esta ubicada a 5 cuadras del subte C que va a Manhattan y cuyas estaciones tocan casi todos los puntos turisticos. Recomiwndo este alojamiento."
3831,160512691,14/6/17,49424194,Alicia,LisaRoxanne's place is such a great location for staying in NYC! We were close to the subway and her street was relatively quiet compared to the high trafficked nearby areas. She was so helpful with our questions and was communicative regarding our inquiries! I would definitely recommend her place. 
3831,161578813,18/6/17,105962523,Jamie,We stayed with Lisa for 3.5 days in June for our anniversary. Upon arrival Lisa was very quick to get to the door and was in constant contact with us. The only thing that really was a concern for us was the smell of cats. My husband and I are both sensitive to cats and it finally caught up with us the last evening/morning of staying. The room was perfect for what we needed because we spent most of our time in the city. Only thing I wished the room had was a full length mirror so I could see my outfits better for our evenings. I would definitely recommend staying at Lisa's for any type of trip. She was a great host and evening got us a bottle of wine for our anniversary. Thanks Lisa💗
3831,164853880,29/6/17,60624405,Valerie,Lisa est vraiment adorable et très serviable. 
3831,166236446,3/7/17,82900308,Yvette,This was my first AirBNB experience and honestly I don't expect to find anywhere else that gives such attention to the comfort of guests. If you're limited on luggage space you could walk in here with nothing but clothes - LisaRoxanne has thought of everything from toothbrushes to UK adaptors! The space is great and transport into Manhattan easy.  You can have privacy if you want it but they are such a nice family I can't think why you wouldn't want to interact. Her little boy Isiah (sorry if I got that wrong) is a real darling.  Can't recommend highly enough. 
3831,168465269,9/7/17,38961133,Roger,"Low-key, quiet residential neighborhood with equally low-key but excellent nearby cafés and restaurants, and if you need stores, the DeKalb-Bedford Avenue business district is a 10-15-minute walk. Six to 10-minute walk to the nearest subway lines (G, S, A and C trains), and a 12-minute walk + subway ride or 25-minute walk to downtown Brooklyn. LisaRoxanne is friendly and attentive. We appreciated her detailed recommendations on where to go for coffee and food. The apartment was clean, with a modern kitchen and bathroom and comfortable bed. If we need a place in Brooklyn again, we'll definitely be back."
3831,171721345,18/7/17,42279469,Pascal,"l'endroit est bien situé dans Brooklyn (commerces, restos,métro....), à 20 minute en métro de Manhattan .
Lisa est présente, communique bien,  est là quand on a besoin d'elle, et en même temps sait se faire discrète.
très bon rapport qualité prix, nous conseillons sans restrictions.

L’appartement est dans la même maison que Lisa mais suffisamment indépendant et Lisa est présente quand  on a besoin de quoi que ce soit. C’était un plaisir !
La climatisation est très agréable, il peut faire très chaud à new york
Le lit est confortable, la chambre assez grande pour tous les bagages, et la cuisine bien équipée
C’est un appartement que je recommande tout à fait , proche des transports publics, pas trop loin de JFK, et dans un quartier très pittoresque."
3831,178397281,5/8/17,66448764,Jean-Christophe,"Lixaroxanne nous a dépanné à deux reprises. Grâce à elle nous avons pu voyager en toute quiétude ! 
Elle reste discrète ce que nous avons personnellement apprécié !... l'appartement est simple mais suffisant pour quelques jours près de New York. 
Et avec internet vous pourrez trouver de bonnes adresses pour manger ou boire ( Donuts Dough  à deux pas et sont à tomber,d'ailleurs sont sur un Guide! )"
3831,180181567,9/8/17,137576994,Bingjuan,Lisa is a very nice host . I had a good day in her house.she told me the details of the  surrounding area and how to go to Chinatown ang time square.
3831,186197097,24/8/17,82960307,Kenneth,This was a great place to stay. Very New York brownstone in a nice street with full facilities except washing machine. Very much afamily home. Friendly neighborhood. Convenient to bus and train with access to all of New York. Really nice helpful host.

3831,189057114,31/8/17,9988828,Gonzalo,"Nos quedamos tres noches con mí mujer e hijo adolescente. La estancia fue buena, es en el tercer piso de una casa de familia con niños. Habitación con cama matrimonial y cama extra para nuestro hijo, la escalera comunica toda la casa y no es un departamento separado del resto de la misma. Para nosotros resultó muy bien, tiene todas las comodidades, baño y cocina privado y buena internet. Lo usamos solo para dormir a nuestra llegada de las visitas a la ciudad. Está a 600mts de una de las principales líneas de Subway y a 20' de Manhattan, lo que lo hace conveniente y práctico. Buen vecindario.
Roxanne que es muy amable nos ayudó con el traslado de llegada del aeropuerto JFK y con tips para nuestra salida via Newark."

3831,195188509,18/9/17,124067914,Jennifer,"There is enough space for three people. You can hear the noises of the family especially because there is no kitchen door. But this didn't bother us. 
Close to the metro and a supermarket. Lisa was very nice and helpful.
We would recommend this place :)"

3831,196258266,22/9/17,98087343,Ryan,This was perfect for our quick trip in the city. For the price the location was fantastic! Lisa was a great communicator all along and made special accommodations for our check in. We were most thankful and recommend!
3831,197500159,25/9/17,139658487,Lindsy,I highly recommend staying here. Centrally located 30 minutes by Uber and your downtown. Cafes and bistros within blocks to walk to. She was very helpful in answering questions and offering suggestions.
3831,198437069,29/9/17,74108593,Vanessa,Ms. LisaRoxanne was a wonderful host! We arrived 2 hours early and she worked with us anyway! The space was more than adequate and comfortable. Clean and besides the regular sounds of Brooklyn very quiet! We were celebrating our honeymoon and Ms. LisaRoxxane congratulated us and had made us a heart shaped cupcake cake! She is very sweet and easy to talk to! Thank you so very much again! We had a great time!
3831,198774823,30/9/17,141523393,Rita,"Meet our needs: a bed to sleep in, a place to get washed up and an eat in kitchen. Great location to Barclays and close to Manhattan. I never got to meet LisaRoxanne personally we communicated via the app."

3831,208144516,31/10/17,28170444,Roselyne,"Le logement est bien situé, il est facile de se rendre au métro (direct pour Manhattan) ou d'aller faire quelques courses. Le quartier est typique et agréable et Lisa Roxanne sympathique.
Toutefois, j'aurais quelques remarques à apporter: il faut savoir qu'il y a 3 enfants de moins de 10 ans dans la famille et que l'on entend tout ce qui se passe dans leur chambre dès 6h30 du matin / le lit d'appoint pour la 3ème personne (moi en l'occurrence) est juste un cauchemar pour le dos, partez donc à 2 ;-) / difficile de faire la cuisine car les casseroles sont dans un état lamentable (nous ne les avons pas utilisées du coup) / les sols étaient sales et collants à notre arrivée (je crois que les voyageurs s'enchaînent trop vite pour que l'hôte ait le temps de faire le ménage...
Voilà, ceci dit, nous avons évidemment adoré notre séjour, mais plus pour la proximité de NY que pour le confort du logement!"

3831,209144017,4/11/17,36057738,Natalia,"LisaRoxanne is amazing host, she provided all information and it was very easy to find place and check in. Apartments located perfectly in Brooklyn, I prefer to walk instead of tacking a metro, so Brooklyn bridge and perfect views to Manhattan skyscrapers are just in 45 minutes of walk) also metro is very close, so there is no problem to get to the heart of NYC. Also LisaRoxanne gave nice recommendations where we can eat or spend evening."
3831,212169583,16/11/17,31838543,Kaylyn,"I had stayed here once before a little over a year ago and had a pleasant experience, and whenever I saw it was open when I was back in town I jumped at the chance because it's clean, comfortable, and conveniently located to the metro and local grocery stores. Safe neighborhood, free street parking- highly recommended to other travelers. Thanks again!"
3831,214045627,24/11/17,58312158,Sara,"A good place to sleep after touring New York. Great neighborhood. Important to have your own well equipped kitchen. Just keep in mind that it is a family home, and the children get up early in the morning :). Good experience."
3831,214588688,26/11/17,72303698,Leanna,"This was my first time using an Airbnb, and I really enjoyed it! Lisa and her family were very welcoming and accommodating to our family, even with a baby and a dog. Her house is close enough to a subway stop, that we were able to go in/out of Manhattan easily and see what we wanted to see. The cake she made for us to celebrate my husband’s birthday was above and beyond. The accommodations were clean, comfortable, and she provided all the modern amenities that a hotel would provide. It was more like a home away from home. My family and I enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend Lisa as a host."
3831,215075902,27/11/17,65975673,Tyler,Had a great time. Would definitely stay there again

3831,217050393,7/12/17,101955460,Sabine,Alles wie beschrieben. Guter Ort für ein paar Tage. Ohne Stauraum für Wäsche und und Hängemöglichkeiten  für nasse Handtücher.
3831,217520423,9/12/17,2129841,Kaitlin,"Lisa’s apartment was perfect for our one night stay (for my husband, 9 month old baby, and me), and would have been great for a longer stay too, though we were in transit. 

We enjoyed the private floor at the top of Lisa’s busy, family home. The bedroom is spacious, the kitchen is fully equipped and the water is hot :) Lisa provided us with a comfy portable crib for our baby and we all slept well.

Lisa’s house is conveniently located to subways and Fulton St and lots of great eateries nearby.

If you’re traveling with heavy or much luggage, be prepared to carry it up two flights of stairs. No big deal. And plenty of space to store your things once you’re up there.

Would happily stay again! Thanks, Lisa."
3831,218000574,10/12/17,134274102,Greg,Lisa was a great host and was quick to respond with local suggestions! Highly recommended!

3831,220009571,20/12/17,43648320,Nurul,"Lisa was very warm towards us and her apartment and hospitality made us feel like we were going home instead of to an accommodation.
Everything that was needed during our stay was there and we didn’t have to ask Lisa for anything. Even when we did, eg. Towels or extra garbage bag, she was quick to respond.
The apartment was also conveniently located between 2 subways of different lines.
Lisa was also concerned about our arrival and often checked on us if we are okay. 
She also helped to coordinate our transfer to the airport for a reasonable price that we can’t possibly get with Uber."

3831,226600814,11/1/18,39717757,Sarah,Lisa Roxanne is a great host. She was very responsive and accommodating to our check-in. There is a lot of space on the upper floor and the bed was large and comfortable.
3831,227313357,14/1/18,909329,Bianca,The kitchen and bathroom were well-appointed and nice. The AirBnB space place was scrupulously clean and the bed was very comfortable. We also appreciated that she made us a special deal to reserve the place the night before to accommodate our early morning arrival because of our flight. She was a pleasant host and this is a great deal in Brooklyn.
3831,227641683,15/1/18,15911501,Allison,Loved our brief stay here. The unique space and the vibrant neighborhood give you a feel for Brooklyn. LisaRoxanne was a great host-very flexible and helpful. I wish we had more time in Brooklyn and would definitely return! 
3831,228608483,20/1/18,5905887,Ari,LisaRoxanne’s place is quiet and cozy on a beautiful block of Clinton Hill. We had to change our reservation arrival times because of scheduling conflict and she was totally flexible and accommodating. This is a great value.
3831,231100620,30/1/18,45150770,Kazue,家の近くにバスが色々通っていて、地下鉄駅からも近いです。水周りも綺麗で、旅行中でも朝食や夕食を自分たちで用意できてリラックスできました。リサさんも心のこもった対応をしてくれます。また利用したいです。

3831,235375044,16/2/18,21151850,Julia,"This place is not accurately represented by the photos and description, it is much smaller and more cramped, noisy and dingy appearing, and open to the landing where the family lives on the floor below."
3831,235677332,17/2/18,173683633,Heather,We stayed at LisaRoxanne's spot for one night. It was great for us. We explored the neighborhood and hit up some interesting bars. There was plenty of street parking and the room was clean and comfortable with a private bath and kitchen.

3831,236552541,19/2/18,1345141,Erin,"Lisa and family were accommodating, helpful and flexible with checkin and checkout.  I didn’t need much but Lisa was prepared for everything!  She really does have a nice little suite setup for guests complete with a fully stocked kitchen and appliances!  And the bed was divine :) we slept like a dream.  Thanks again, Lisa!"
3831,237108605,21/2/18,122912395,David,Nice space! Excellent suite layout with a nice kitchen with all one needs. Very clean and welcoming. Easy walk to the A/C line subway.
3831,237869205,24/2/18,8105405,James,"We didn't have much time to spend inside the apartment but LisaRoxanne was easy to deal with and the apartment served our purposes very well.  Convenient location, short walk to the C train if you're heading into Manhattan, nice cafes & bars near by. Good stay at a reasonable price!"
3831,241269623,8/3/18,126925436,Micaela,"Lisa Roxanne es una excelente anfitriona. Nos consiguió el traslado desde el aeropuerto hasta su departamento, nos permitió dejar las valijas en  su casa el día que nos ibamos ya que nuestro vuelo salía a a la noche y nos dejo una copia de las llave para poder ingresar. 

Si bien el departamento estaba bien ubicado, limpio y tenía lo necesario para la estadía (por ejemplo: toallas, cepillo de dientes, artículos de tocador, entre otros); hay que tener en cuenta que Lisa tiene niños pequeños y puede llegar a ser un poco ruidoso. 

En resumen, lo recomiendo para las personas que quieran visitar Nueva York a precios accesibles."
3831,243857997,17/3/18,168117129,Ashley,This brownstone was perfect for what we needed it for. Short walk to Barclays and shops/restaurants. LisaRoxanne was a great host and always answered my questions in a timely manner. Ample parking was also available on the street which was a plus!
3831,244762757,19/3/18,152473737,Paul,"Excellently placed for communting into Manhattan, we used RoxAnne's house as a base for just two nights. Short walk to Franklin Ave subway on the C line, with nice coffee house on route, the Daily Press, and a late opening corner shop half way from the subway back to Gates Ave. Comfy beds, well equiped kitchen and lovely host - although we didn't see much of her."
3831,245793931,23/3/18,161128121,Luis,"Lisa is nice and receptive, I love the place, the only thing is that sometimes can be a little noisy, everything else great, I really recommend this place"

La recomiendo mucho para ir con la familia"
3831,249683841,2/4/18,1489158,Heather,"The apartment is a great location, you can get to so much in lower Brooklyn. We were driving and parking was easy and walking in the neighborhood, you have a lot of different foods/places to try. We really enjoyed our stay with LisaRoxanne!"
3831,251787475,8/4/18,46176717,Gavin,"Lisa Roxanne was a great host and very accommodating.  Great communication as we asked many questions before coming, and she responded quickly to each.  She provided some great recommendations on places in the area and directions on how to get around.  There was plenty of space for the 3 of us and having the updated kitchen was very convenient.  The location is great, a few blocks from various subways.  The lines going in and out of manhattan were frequent and straightforward. Overall, a great place to stay."

3831,262041837,7/5/18,60903143,Ann,"The location is great, and this is probably the best feature of this place. The only issue we had is that the guest room is the third floor of the family home and all the noise carries up the stairs. Even with the door closed it was quite loud."
3831,262355914,8/5/18,31932955,Kenneth,LisaRoxanne’s place was great. It was super easy to get to am located by plenty of things to do.

3831,265268645,16/5/18,138574011,Alexander,"Die auf den ersten Blick einfach eingerichtete Wohnung bietet alles was man für das tägliche Leben braucht, und in manchen Punkten sogar noch ein bisschen mehr. Die Küche ist mit Gasherd, Backofen, Toaster, Mikrowelle und einer Kühl-/Gefrierkombi gut ausgestattet. Die Betten waren bequem und der Geräuschpegel überraschend gering. Die Fenster isolieren nicht viele Geräusche, da die Wohnung aber in einem ruhigen und unserem Eindruck nach friedlichem Viertel liegt war das kein Problem. Das rund 7Mbit schnelle WLAN funktionierte Problemlos, LisaRoxanne war durchgehend gut zu erreichen und hat alle Fragen gerne beantwortet. Beim Check-In und Out sowie beim Verlassen und Betreten des Hauses zwischendurch gab es keine Probleme. Auch die Anbindung an die Subway ist gut, bis zur Clinton Washington Av, von der man ohne Umsteigen zu vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten in Manhattan kommt, ist nur knapp 15 Minuten entfernt. An der Station gibt es auch einen gut sortierten Supermarkt. Wir können die Wohnung jedem Empfehlen, der kein fünf-Sterne Hotel sondern eine einfache aber gut ausgestattete Wohnung sucht."

Das WLAN funktioniert einwandfrei und ist sehr schnell.
Die Unterkunft befindet sich an der direkten U-Bahn Linie A, die sowohl zum Flughafen JFK als auch nach Manhattan zum Port Authority Bus Terminal führt.
In der Umgebung gibt es sowohl einen Supermarkt, Diners etc.
LisaRoxanne ist eine sehr unkomplizierte Gastgeberin, die wir sehr empfehlen werden.
Wer eine luxuriöse Unterkunft sucht, ist vielleicht nicht richtig, aber für den Besuch von New York war sie für uns perfekt."

4484,248421191,31/3/18,179985958,Alex,Robin’s place was great. Very spacious and we got the place to ourselves. Both her and her mom were very timely with responses when we had questions and let us leave our bags there after we checked out. The subway stop is a little far but still walkable. Overall we had a great stay!
5022,1023197,20/3/12,324326,Eduardo,Great host with a very cute apartment. Easy and quick transit to the heart of Manhattan. Very recommended!

Il est aussi facile d’accès, plusieurs lignes de Subway pour atteindre l’appartement. Les lignes de Subway sont à respectivement 5 et 10 minutes à pieds donc très accessible à n'importe quelle heure.

Je n'ai pas eu la chance de rencontrer Luna directement, mais elle a été réactive dès que j'ai eu besoin d'informations (phone et mail).
J'ai été accueilli a mon arrivé tout était parfaitement orchestré.

Quoi qu'il en soit je vous le recommande vraiment si vous voulez un appartement qui vous permettra d'être à Time Square en moins de 30 minutes."
5022,4264441,23/4/13,122168,Sabrina,"I had a great experience staying at Luna´s Place! The place is perfectly located in a very cultural area of NYC between 2 Subway stations, and a cross town bus, so it was easy getting around NYC. There is also a great Bikram Yoga studio down the street for those yogi´s visiting. For those concerned with neighborhood safety, I often came home late and felt safe. Her Apartment is a great size, a LARGE Studio for NY standards, and has everything one needs! Very comforting. Luna is also a great renter, if there was anything I needed she was quick to respond. I definitely recommend staying at Luna´s for short or longer visits!
"
5022,7113101,7/9/13,6781646,Nic & Rachel,"Luna's apartment was simple, clean, and very well located to both the green and red subway lines. My experience there was quit nice.  The neighborhood can catch you off guard if you arrive at night. But its charm really grows after spending some time walking around. Logistically, Luna handled everything very well, even though my train arrived quite late. Overall, Luna's place is a pleasant reminder that Manhattan still has some spots that don't make you feel like your in a shopping mall.     "
5022,259205818,30/4/18,6049019,Brodie,"Luna was very accommodating and extremely helpful. Check in/out were a breeze and I loved the apartment.

She's a very sweet person and caring of her visitors and we loved her cats! I would definitely recommend Tina's home to anyone!  "
5099,4107,16/6/09,13219,Kasper,My girlfriend and me had a wonderful time at Tina's place. It is so cosy and relaxed and we would recommend the apartment to anyone and definitely consider to go back again !!!

5099,6236,27/7/09,26179,Kornel,Dead cockroaches. Cat hair everywhere. Not very clean.
5099,7036,9/8/09,27403,Kelly,"What a fantastic location and friendly neighbourhood.
We walked in to town everyday and felt perfectly safe at night time.
The flat was a nice size and everything we needed was there. The air conditioning in the bedroom was especially powerful and welcome in the hot summer heat!
The only drawback for us was Tina's 2 friendly cats as I'm not really a cat lover and found it difficult to deal with. However, Tina was very clear in her advert that she has cats so that was entirely MY fault for not reading carefully!!
An enjoyable trip!"
5099,8053,23/8/09,22880,Zoee,"We absolutely loved Tina's place. It is really close to everything and bigger than we expected it to be. Plus, her cats are amazing. We didn't want to leave we loved them so much. They are both super loving. It is an older building and apartment but that's kind of part of the NYC experience I guess. I was a bit unhappy that I didn't know it was a smoker's apartment until too late but once we got there and settled in, it didn't matter at all. We'd stay there again."
5099,10255,15/9/09,33505,Louise,"We enjoyed staying at Tina's apartment. The location was amazing, easy to keep tidy, and had everything we needed in there.

Tina was there to greet us when we arrived, she was very friendly and explained everything we'd need to know very clearly, and was accessible the whole time we were there.

There were only two small downsides, the first being the cats - although they were really lovely and friendly, we were faced with cleaning up poop and vomit one day, though that's nobody's fault. If you've never had cats before you might find this a bit daunting but we got on with it and it wasn't really a problem. The other downside was the outside noise, even with the windows closed it was quite noisy (with the traffic constantly moving outside), but we were so tired every night that we slept fine anyway.

Thanks again Tina. :)"
5099,11297,25/9/09,28378,Theo,We enjoyed our stay at Tina's apt & she was an excellent hostess. The apt is centrally located & the cats were not an issue with us.

5099,14753,24/10/09,26245,Stuart & Marcus,Tina's apartment was great. It was very well situated being just 10 min walk from Grand Central Station and the Empire State Building.

Tina was very understanding when we got in later than planned due to a problem with our flight and was very helpful. Would definitely recommend. Thanks, Tina!"
5099,21244,23/12/09,56428,Natalie,"You must be in shape to visit Tina apartmant. It's a 5fl walk up a little hard after a ling walk around city. Her cats are very nice they always hungry and ask for food which some mistake for being affectionate. I bought them food and they became more mellow. Apartmant was a dusty and needed cleaning when I arrived. Cat hair was everywhere, carpet needed to he cleaned. Shower wasn't working which wasn't very pleasant. As I had to go to my local gym to take a shower! Do NOT recommend. Blaming her shower wasn't working by me putting towels in bath. Womans nuts!
Now she's suing me for ""taking her pillow"". "

The apt is centrally located. All important places within walking distance and via Grand Central you enter the whole city conveniently by metro. The M15 bus stop downtown is right around the corner.
It's a brilliant and very safe place with a great neighbourhood: Bars, restaurants, supermarkets, late night delis and much else.
Two lovely and easy-care cats - I loved it to come home and be welcomed joyously by the two pleasant cats.
I really recommend Tina's apt. Splendid hostess! Thank you Tina!"

Place is just like the pictures and was spacious and clean when we got there but make sure you like cats as they do shed quite a bit of fur. The area was great and close to everything, so if ur a visitor/tourist then this place is perfect.  I will definitely reccomend Tina to anyone as she really was great and tried to be as accommodating as possible. Thanks for everything again Tina!!"
5099,106703,27/9/10,235275,Jurgen,"Is glad to stay in Tina's Apt. the apt is just closed to the convinent store (around the corner), food (1 block away) and take another 7 to 10 blocks to times square..
"
5099,123951,21/10/10,245529,Patrick,"We recently stayed at Tina's apartment for a week.  The location is great as it is about a 10-minute walk from the Grand Central Station which with the subway can take you any where you want to go. The distance to the Airport Bus station that will take you with your luggage to the airport is also nearby. It is in a safe neighborhood.

There is fast food and restaurant within a 2 block walk which is certainly convenient.  The place is what is in the picture.  It is clean when as promised.  Do note that there is a $50 cleanup fee to be paid upon arrival.  We thought the fee should be waived or be included inside the rental fee as it is the owner's obligation to hand over a clean apartment.

Having to walk up the 5 floors has not been a problem even with 3 big luggages.  Having no wifi as advertised is also not a problem as we brought along our Apple Airport Express.

You must love cats to stay in this apartment as they shed hair all week round.  It would be good to have a vacuum cleaner or a hair remover around. The poo smell of the cats was a little strong in the last couple of days of our stay.

Tina was very friendly and had to leave the town for a few days.  She did leave an email to inquire if everything was alright.  That was thoughtful of her.  She also helped with maps of NY as well as advice about transport back to the airport for us which came in handy.

Overall, a good place to stay in place of location and accessibility.  Thanks Tina, for your help."
5099,575470,27/9/11,1148802,Norma,"The apartment has an excellent location, you can go wherever in Manhattan by subway. The Central Station is within 5-10 minutes walking. The neighbourhood is good as well, you have some restaurantes nearby like subway, mcdonalds, sushi etc. There is also a mini market next door  where you can buy food and drink and the supermarket is 2 blocks away.
Tina gave us a NYC guide and it was really useful, she left many brochures from restaurants also to order food at home.
The cats aren't bad but they aren't clean at all, we found poop on the kitchen table once and we had to clean vomit like 4 times because one of them seemed to be sick. Because of this we didn't like to cook or even to eat at home and we didn't use the sofa because we found vomit there also.
The windows have no blinds or dark curtains, so the neighbours can see you at any time in the bedroom and the kitchen.
It is a 5th floor without elevator, it wasn't a problem for us but you should be aware of it.
I do recommend Tina's place if you are looking for a well located place to sleep, but not to spend much time there."
5099,645201,19/10/11,1164044,Tomas,"it was a pleasure to meet tina and to be gast in her appartement. the appartement is really close to grand central station and 5th avenue and also there is a bus station in front of the house that brings you downtown to 2nd avenue 1st street where is a good spot to go out for dinner and drinks. the appartement is in the 5th floor and directly under the rooftop which is a nice place to go up and pause a second.
we really enjoyed the stay!

Tina is a great host, she was very understanding about our flight delay and helpful in giving us some hints concerning best places to visit. The apartment is in a very conveninet location, close to Grand Central, midtown is within the walking distance. The apartment itself is very comfortable and neat. Only drawback is that it can get really noisy because of the morning traffic. The neighborhood itself is very comfortable with many convenient stores, bars, pubs and diners. We really enyojed our stay!"
5099,8115792,16/10/13,4874364,Lyndel,Tina is a lovely host. She welcomed us on arrival and was so friendly and helpful and gave us some great local info on what to see. The apartment is charming - we definitely felt like we stayed in a true NYC apartment. Would definitely stay at Tina's place again.
5099,8601956,7/11/13,9488908,Olaf,"Tina is a great host, very accessible and has very good tipps where to go and what to see in NY! The appartment is cosy, everything was clean. We can warmly recommend Tinas place!"
5099,11770802,14/4/14,9313309,Melissa,"Tina was a great host. She was very welcoming and helpful and was open to letting us check in and leave when it was convenient for us. The place was clean, decorated, and in a convenient location. I would definitely recommend staying there!"

5099,12215607,26/4/14,13735117,Duncan,"Fun place to stay if you are doing stuff at the UN (5 minute walk). Tina is friendly and helpful, her flat is full of books and artworks (she's an artist and musician). Lot cooler than yr average NY hotel.
This was my first airbnb experience, and I will definitely be doing it again, even though I'm not sure it was a whole lot cheaper than a grotty hotel.
Only hassle was a mix-up over a cleaning fee after I left - why not just include it in the upfront cost?"
5099,12538163,5/5/14,12774365,Renee,"This was a fantastic place to stay. Tina's a delightful host--she met us on arrival and she was always available to answer a quick email or phone call if we had a question. Her apartment is cozy and welcoming. It's also perfectly located….only about a 5-10-minute walk from Grand Central. Fun neighborhood, too. We'd definitely stay here again!"
5099,13036340,18/5/14,11212151,Charlotte,"Tina couldn't have been a more friendly and attentive host! She met me when I arrived and even lugged my suitcase up the stairs! Throughout my stay, she stayed in communication to ensure that everything was fine, which it was. The apartment was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the shower was excellent! The neighborhood felt safe and everything one needs is close-by. Tina and her apartment are keepers!"
5099,13422940,27/5/14,8523980,Erik,"Tina is a most gracious and caring host. She personally welcomed me to the apartment and explained the various amenities. The apartment itself was clean and cosy, making me immediately feel at home. Tina send me several messages afterwards asking if there was anything I needed which I appreciated very much. The neighbourhood is at walking distance from big attractions like Time Square and the Empire State Building. Don't expect a quiet stay though because the Manhattan symphony of sirens, car horns and engine noise comes full blast through the windows 24/7. If you can stand that, there is no better place to be in New York. If you don't like walking stairs you might want a place that has an elevator."
5099,14131392,12/6/14,13385837,Antonio,"Tina is a fantastic host. She personally greeted us and helped us get installed in the apartment. She also was kind enough to give us a lot of helpful information from nearby stores and restaurants; and was checking with us daily to make sure that everything was OK. The apartment is very cozy and has a great location,  only a few blocks away from Grand Central you can go pretty much anywhere in Manhattan by subway. 

Overall: Great Host, and fantastic location."
5099,15578004,12/7/14,13477997,Miriam,"We stayed at Tina's for a few days and it could have not gone better. The place is exactly as is appears on the photos, comfy, cozy and mega central, we fell right at home from moment one. The bed is super comfortable and the sheet in particular were delightful.  She made some room for our stuff so we could have our stuff out comfortably and left us some nice toiletries to last our stay at her place. The air con machine and fan that she has in the apt were extremely welcome! Tina was a wonderful host and got out of her way numerous times to help us out. Our flight was delayed and she hang around to be able to welcome us properly, she took the time to know us and gave us great advice on the city, places to go, where to eat etc... She was always available on the phone and got back to us immediately every time. We could not be happier with her and the stay at her place. She became our New York Fairy Godmother! "
5099,19773820,18/9/14,12402826,Jaclyn,"We just finished our 9 night stay in Tina's apartment and had an amazing time! 

The apartment is clean, bright and well decorated. It's greatest asset is its location. It's right near Grand Central Station which means you can get virtually anywhere in New York - essential if you're travelling. It's also in a safe neighbourhood meaning you feel perfectly safe walking around after dark. However the noise from the street does carry up into the apartment, so if you're a light sleeper I'd recommend buying ear plugs.

Tina is a great host. When we arrived, she ran through all of her favourite places to eat in the neighbourhood - she even knew awesome places that have gluten free options. She checked in with us daily and readily answered any questions we had about the places we were visiting.

Would highly recommend staying here if you're visiting New York!"
5099,20352632,28/9/14,15976226,Shannon,"Tina was a wonderful host, from the get go she was easy to contact and swift in replying to messages or emails. 

The place itself is right in the heart of the city, really close to grand central which gets you anywhere and right near some wonderful restaurants and bars! My personal fav was a ramen place on 3rd avenue! 

Everything was clean and easy to use and the shower was hot and strong, which I hear is rare in manhattan. 

Just be warned that it's noisy in midtown so soak it up or take some earplugs! But that's all part of the manhattan experience! "
5099,20747258,5/10/14,8712461,Erinn,"Tina was great!! She met us at the apartment showed us the ropes and checked on us each day. Her recommendations for food in all different areas of the city were spot on delicious. We did struggle with the five flights of stairs, no blinds on the windows and very aged mattress. But the neighborhood was very nice, safe and great food just right down stairs ""Bravest"". Subway was a few blocks away. Overall we had a great trip and would do it again in a heart beat."
5099,21466102,18/10/14,15984119,Gloria,"Tina is the best host ever, charm and knowledgeable, we really enjoy the stay. The apt is actually bigger than it looks on the pic, cozy and easy to every attraction. Will definitely come back again!"

Unfortunately we could not meet Tina but one of his friends has been waiting for us until we arrived even later than expected. When we had questions during our stay he was quickly available and Tina often get back to us to be sure that everything was ok. 
This apartment really made us feel as if we were New Yorkers ;)"

5099,36143155,25/6/15,27059977,Fabián,"Tina was a great host, the apartment was really nice and cozy. She greeted me at the door and explained how everything works. She gave me some good recommendations with places where to go out. The neighborhood is very lively and there's many bars to go out nearby. The apt is located near grand central station, which is great for getting to and from the airport. There are many sights nearby to go out and see the city since it's in the heart of Manhattan. I would definitely stay there again if I return to NY."

The room is on the fifth floor of a walk-up but for the size, price and location - it's tough to beat."

Apartment was ideal for my 10-night stay. Clean and had everything I needed. Apple TV was a nice bonus. Just 5-10 mins walk from Grand Central station. Lots of bars and restaurants around. Perfect for exploring the city."
5099,48720062,28/9/15,40659618,Sherill,"Tina was very welcoming, met us in person in the first night and gave us tips to go around New York. She texted once or twice a day to ensure things are going well with us. Bath tub was clogged in the first night and was fixed promptly the next day after notifying Tina.

It was a great experience staying at Tina's apartment."
5099,49781482,6/10/15,15222510,John,Enjoyed our stay at Tina's place.  Tina was great to work with.  Her place was as described in the listing.  Good location and everything you need to prepare your own food.  Look forward to staying there again on my next trip to NY.
5099,51452202,20/10/15,23211,Joanna,"Tina was very communicative and texted me a couple of weeks before we headed to NYC. She met us to check in and was helpful with nearby restaurants and recommendations. She texted almost every day to see how things were going. She sounds like she's been booking her place for a while and is very meticulous about things; her booking requirements, cancellation policy, and additional cleaning fee should be noted.
We know we had to walk up stairs to get to her place on the 5th floor, but it was still exhausting every time! Loved AppleTV, you can definitely hear the traffic noise so light sleepers need earplugs. I noticed the shower head was really high so probably not ideal for petite/shorter people. Easy walk to Grand Central Station, Time Square, and Empire State Building, and small market on the corner is open 24/7.
Overall great experience with Tina, her apt, the neighborhood, and loved NYC!"
5099,58782298,5/1/16,41256119,Francesco,"Il nostro soggiorno nell'appartamento di Tina è stato piacevole.
L'appartamento corrisponde alle foto. Ci aspettavamo che fosse un po' più nuovo e curato (il letto aveva le molle molto rovinate e, sopratutto i primi giorni, si sentiva abbastanza puzza di fumo e un odore strano in casa). Ho amato particolarmente la zona soggiorno, con il bel divano, la poltrona in pelle e la Apple Tv per rilassarsi.
Buona posizione (meno di dieci minuti a piedi dalla Grand Central Station); ottimo poi il wifi gratis. In appartamento facevamo solo colazione ma, volendo, la cucina è abbastanza attrezzata per fare tranquillamente anche altri pasti.
La comunicazione con Tina è stata buona. A parte iniziali fraintendimenti, dopo esserci chiariti Tina è stata molto gentile e disponibile e, durante il nostro soggiorno, ci scriveva spesso per sapere se andava tutto bene.
Piccole annotazioni: le scale sono molte e ripide (Tina lo scrive chiaramente e quindi lo sapevamo!), portatevi valigie poco pesanti e comode da trasportare!!; il riscaldamento centralizzato funziona fin troppo bene (e non si può spegnere), dovevamo dormire con le finestre del soggiorno leggermente aperte nonostante la stagione! Il traffico è quello tipico di New York..Consiglio quindi dei tappi per le orecchie per il rumore e delle mascherine per gli occhi per dormire (le finestre non hanno gli oscuranti).
Nel complesso siamo stati soddisfatti!! Vale la pena provare a vivere in un vero appartamento newyorkese e, sicuramente, si ha a disposizione molto più spazio che in hotel..

5099,70254718,17/4/16,8805297,Richard,"Tina was very welcoming and made us feel at ease. She was also attentive during the stay.
The apartment is very well situated in a great location in Murray Hill.
The apartment is on the larger size for NYC places and is light, bright & airy. It is well equipped for a short or longer stay."
5099,74560637,15/5/16,4196468,Julia,"Tinas Appartement war so wie beschrieben, es ist eine typische New Yorker Wohnung und auch schon etwas älter.
Die Lage war der perfekte Ausgangspunkt zu jedem Spot in Manhattan und man kommt sogar nach Brooklyn innerhalb max. 30 Minuten mit der Subway.

Tina war vor der Anreise und während des Aufenthaltes immer erreichbar und sehr hilfsbereit. 
Wir kamen später als geplant an, Tina war trotzdem da und hat uns die Wohnung in aller Ruhe gezeigt.

Gerne wieder!"
5099,100430875,9/9/16,3408096,Esther,"Tina is a great host. She made the effort to meet us and even helped to carry our super heavy luggage up to her apartment which was 5 storeys high! Her apartment is clean and good flow of air. Even if the aircon has to be removed due to impending hurricane, it was comfy enough. The location of the apartment is also great, little distance from the main tourist area but hey! what's NYC without the sirens from ambulance and FDNY! Try staying there and you feel like a real New Yorker! Oh! And her bed was super duper comfy!"
5099,108822854,17/10/16,13072618,Jorge,"Tina fue muy amable al recibirnos y nos ayudó en todo lo que necesitamos. La localización del apartamento es inmejorable, es espacioso y tal como se describe  en el anuncio. Tuvimos la mala suerte de que justo en la semana en que estuvimos la cocina estaba estropeada, así que tuvimos que apañarnos solo con el microondas. Tampoco fue un gran problema y Tina dijo que ya había llamado para que vienieran a repararlo.

En general una experiencia muy positiva y recomendable."

She was extremely accomodating as we arrived 2 hours before the check-in time that we had discussed and she came right over to check us in. She even helped us to carry our luggage upstairs.  She took the time to show us everything in the apartment that we may need and even offered us to use her personal things if we needed them. Don’t let the 5 floor walk-up scare you, my wife and I travelled up and down these stairs many times per day. My wife handled the stairs like a champ and she is nearing 6 months pregnant. We were also able to walk to Times Square and to many of the activities that we did during the trip. As long as you don’t mind a bit of a walk, the location is great. We enjoyed all of the exploring that we got to do along the way. There were also some great places to eat within a block or two.  Tina gave wonderful food and local recommendations that we tried and loved. We would definitely stay at Tina’s place again."

He did more for us than I imagined and we became great friend. He gave us advice as people who had never spent long periods in the city and help us out any way he could.  The apartment is clean and cosy with a laid back feel. WeI will stay with him again the next time I am in NY.  Thanks Garon!

I am so happy that I had the opportunity to stay in such an interesting area.  The subway is close and there are a few little cafes nearby that I loved. You must go to Mrs Daliah's Cafe for cucumber lemonade! I got to meet another traveler staying there, who I hung out with, so that was cool. Also Garon's cats are so adorable.

Garon is very relaxed and a great roommate. We both led our lives and just saw each other when we both were at home. We had some great talks and he's a very inspiring person. His cats were also a great addition to me feeling very at home there. 
There are a lot of nice nieghbors, and in the neighborhood, there are new cafes and restaurants popping up. It's close to the G-train which connects you to anywhere in Brooklyn and Manhattan. 
I wish I didn't had to leave!

5121,368835,12/7/11,693011,Estelle,"Garon was a very nice host and he let us feel like home in his place, despite we didn't see him during our 6 days stay.
But unfortunately the apartment was absolutely not like pictures and description on the website: not very clean, and most of all very old, cheap and untidy. The room was too small and a lot of stuffs inside (closet was full) for a 2 persons 6 days stay.
In our opinion it's not really a rentable place, even if Garon's neighboor was very nice and helpfull, and even if Garon warned us about the possible untidyness in the place because of his absence."

The apartment is full of interesting stuff and Garon's stories. Garon himself is one of the most laid back persons I have ever met. And cats gave the place a lot of charm and a ""warm touch"". Each of us had his own key and we were free to come and go as we wish - no hassle at all!

A neighbourhood is nice. Manhattan is approx. 20min away - close to nothing! A lot of places to eat out -  I could recommend to anyone who plans to stay there to visit a food place right on the right of McDo, close to the A/C subway station - a great deal of specialities straight from Trynidad! =)"
5121,1222514,3/5/12,2046833,Rob,"Thanks Garon! - I stayed for just over 2 weeks everything was fine, easy going, free reign of the flat pretty much.

Whilst at first I thought the neighbourhood was not so good, It is safe and I was out a fair amount at night. The G and C are close by (the G's a little closer and you can easily change to the L to get to lower manhattan)

Anyway, if you are considering this then you should defo go for it, for the price I don't think there would be anything better!"

Garon is a very special person and an absolute angel, made me feel totally at home in a highly peaceful and relaxed environment,

5121,3423063,27/1/13,2556663,Tim,"It was so nice staying at Garon's! For the first glance it didn't look very fancy or something, but this place is gorgeous from inside out. It's pretty easy to get to subway G train or if you walk a little more you can get to A train which goes directly to JFK airport. Garon is a very kind person, very open-minded and friendly! We also have a lot in common in area of culture! I'll recommend this place to everyone who is open-minded and want to feel how people live there in NYC. Neighborhood looked safe. Despite it was one of the coldest weeks for last year in town, but heating worked well and the room was warm!"
5121,3660569,1/3/13,4729917,Kevin,"Garon is one of the coolest individuals I've met in a long time. The room is great close to both the G and A C trains, and the neighborhood has an  organic market right around the corner. Laundry is close by also. There are two beautiful cats that lounge around all day adding to the chillness of the place. There is a sage like wisdom that Garon  imparts with any newbie to NY, and I am a far better New Yorker and individual for meeting this cool cat. 
"
5121,4038248,4/4/13,1387678,Celina,"Garon is undoubtedly the most welcoming and nice host ever. You feel at home right away, he is exciting and passionate, discussions are super interesting and he is extremely friendly. A stay at his place is a good mood cure. I highly recommend!"
5121,5529489,4/7/13,1523322,Traci,"Had a great stay with Garon! You'll have a super cool and helpful roommate for the length of your stay, who just might cook you breakfast and make you tea in the morning. The neighborhood is really interesting and beautiful, worth spending some time just wandering around. I stayed for almost two weeks, often coming back late at night, and never felt unsafe in the area. The room itself has everything you need. And the apartment has two friendly cats :). If I were to come back to Brooklyn, I would definitely stay with Garon again."

5121,9525620,1/1/14,10393975,Bruce,"I had a good feeling about Garon before I arrived and was not disappointed at all.  I tried to keep busy and didn't want to be in his way. My stay was quite lengthy so we did have a lot of time to sit and chat about so many things and had a lot of laughs.

I'm already planning to go back and I will try to stay with Garon again and again, the space, location and host are all a perfect match for me."

5121,17312134,10/8/14,19096223,Jari,"Garon is a great guy, very friendly and easygoing, as well as trustworthy!!! I really liked staying at his place for five nights. He gave me useful advices about what I should visit in NY and we had cool conversations about everyday life! Furthermore, his place is located very close to 2 metro stations and it takes only 20-30 minutes to reach Manhattan! I strongly recommend staying at his place!"
5121,22685726,11/11/14,23305942,Laurel,Garon was a generous and helpful host. His accommodations are clean and cozy. He even invited me to dance at his second reception! It was truly a pleasure to meet him and stay in his home.

The area is very safe, even at night, full of nice restaurants, pubs and cafe. There are two subway stations very close. If you are visiting NYC this is a good place where you can stay. "

I left it right to the last minute to sort out accommodation and even though he wasn't actually around, he went out of his way to sort everything out for me. Really thankful!! Area is nice and has a few hidden gems. Would recommend :)"
5121,52023013,25/10/15,6154262,Martin,"Garon is a really nice guy, interesting to talk to and knows a lot about the area. He's one of the more personable hosts I've met. His cats are super friendly. I was worried about the futon but it honestly feels like a regular bed, I had a great nights sleep. I was happy to be in that part of brooklyn again, it's much more relaxed and the G train is really close. Would recommend."
5121,52776879,1/11/15,267281,Jer,"Garon was the nicest host I've ever dealt with on AirBnB, which is saying a lot because I've met some really nice hosts. I ended up having to adjust my pickup time for the key, which he graciously accommodated by having another wonderful person (Christian) meet me at the apartment. These are true gentlemen.

The bed was very comfortable and cozy. I slept very well. Commutes to the Javits Center and other parts of Manhattan were a cinch, often as short as 30 minutes.

This place is a really good value for someone needing a thrifty bed and a quiet place work or chill out. I hope to visit again."

5172,19074,3/12/09,57675,James,Had a nice stay at Adrienne's apartment in Murray Hill.  I'd definitely recommend her place to friends.
5172,20178,13/12/09,52058,Nathalie,The apartment is very quiet and clean!  Very zen. And the bed is extremely comfortable.  We felt at home.  Parking nearby on 32nd btw 2nd and 3rd was very affordable.
5172,20542,16/12/09,55946,Jordan,Adrienne's apartment is very nice and clean.  It is in a convenient location just blocks down from the subway. We had a very comfortable experience in her apartment!

5172,60798,4/7/10,136936,Samoa,Great little place in a lovely neighborhood. Adrinne was very friendly and easy to talk to. She went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. We had a comfortable stay in her apartment.
5172,61812,6/7/10,122053,Ariel,"Adrienne, I have just seen your review and it surprises me how can you be so accurate when you were never there or never met you. What do you mean the apartment was not well kept? It is true I made the next guest wait, for approximately 40 minutes if I recall and I apologized to him, and it was time I spent cleaning for him. What do you mean the guest did not fit through the hallway? This has to be figurative speech because he did fit and left his stuff in the room while he went to buy groceries during that time. And again it wasn't late at night (6 or 7 P.M., the time the other guest was arriving doesn't constitute late at night, at least for the standards in my country). As it says below, you have to state the facts or at least get them right. I hope you got rid of the ant infection in the bathroom and kitchen, because it was very annoying. Apart from that everything was OK!"

5172,66462,19/7/10,123329,Cristina,"Adri was a wonderful host, she and her partners were very helpful and kind at all times. The flat is conveniently placed. Grand Central station really close and Empire State or Times Square at an easy 10-15 minutes walk more or less. Everything clean though bathroom a bit old. We missed a TV, nevertheless. Good value. Thanks Adrienne!"
5172,74912,7/8/10,105656,Bruce,"Adrienne was great at the initial contact, responded quickly when my other booking with AirBnB fell over. Really enjoyed staying in her apartment in Murray Hill. The place is small, but is a comfortable and quiet haven at the end of a busy NY day. The location is excellent too, and near some iconic NY landmarks. She is very generous, happy for guests to use her belongings. There is no TV, but hey, you don't go to New York City to watch television. Did not get to meet Adrienne directly, which was a pity, as she herself was away travelling. However, her friend Maria lives nearby, and was very helpful in Adrienne's absence. Thanks so much Adrienne, and best wishes to both of you!"
5172,78680,15/8/10,150252,Sophie,"A great host.  Everything came exactly as advertised.  Communicating with Adrienne and her friends was easy and reasonably quick.  Bruce M.'s comments below summarize our impressions well. 

There are some small outside costs, such as laundry pickup and dropoff, but worth the small effort as it keeps the overall cost down. Excellent value.  We would definitely stay again if the chance arises.

Thanks Adrienne!"
5172,118318,13/10/10,221086,Elizabeth,"Adrienne's apartment was a wonderful place to stay!

I felt like i was staying at a friend. I would recomend it ! Its the place i will stay always when in NYC"

5172,611519,9/10/11,977651,Anita,"Adrienne's place was perfect! Small as she describes but very well organised and very good vibes to it! The bed was indeed very comfortable which is a definite plus when you have exhausting days around Manhattan (yes, shopping). I didn't get to meet Adrienne personnally since she was away (which is logical if you are renting her place), but picking up the keys and giving them back went smoothly and her friend Maria was very nice and helpful.

Would definitely try to book her place next time I come!"
5172,645023,19/10/11,1119625,Ermina,"everithig was like Adrianne wrote. it is a small apartment but perfect for a couple (like us) or two good friends. perfect location! very old building but in a good and safe neighborhood. she was a perfect and very kind host, even we did not meet her. also her friend Maria, who was charged for the key exchange, was wery kind. 
we kindly recommend Adrianne as your host!"
5172,661858,25/10/11,559868,Tery,"To begin with, this was my first time using the Airbnb Service and my first time in NYC. Adrienne's placed looked very warm and cozy in her photos and was priced the most economical for my budget. Setting up this reservation was very easy. Adrienne replied to my email and accepted my reservation. She called before my arrival to NY to confirm and went over the procedure for our stay. She was very helpful with information on how to get to her apartment from the airport and where to pick up her keys. Her apartment was located in the most welcoming area (to my experience) in New York. Her Murray Hill apartment was close to the metro station, markets, restaurants and bars. What you see in her photos is exactly what you see in her apartment. It is a cozy and welcoming apartment that it you never want to leave. I truly enjoyed my first experience with Airbnb and in NY because I was able to experience it like a local. In the mornings I cooked breakfast, made lunch for my outings, enjoyed a cup of coffee (which was complimentary on her behave) in the evenings. Adrienne left us a package of helpful information with maps, books, things to do in NYC etc. 
My boyfriend and enjoyed our stay in her apartment and look forward to returning to Murray Hill soon. Thank you Adrienne! "
5172,957563,28/2/12,686930,Megan,We had an excellent stay at Adrienne's. She is very friendly and her place is great. Would definitely stay there again.
5172,993721,13/3/12,1854482,Jorge,"This place is centrally located, was able to walk most places that I needed to go. Very comfy bed (memory foam mattress). Great shower. Very clean. What else can you ask for?"
5172,1076344,2/4/12,1349760,Eddie,if you want someone bothering you about using too many towels then stay here .  
5172,1099288,8/4/12,2026796,Anthony,"Adrienne's apartment is right in the middle of NYC, great location with convenient subway stops at 33rd and Grand Central. When we arrived a friend of Adrienne's met us at the apartment and showed us how to use the keys. The apartment is exactly as you see in the photos, with perhaps a couple extra pieces of furniture added. The radiator seems to be automatically on, so it does get a bit warm. We were able to regulate the temperatuer by opening the windows and, if needed, turning on the AC. The bathroom was clean and a good size for the city, the only comment is the pole in the corner gets really hot and it nearly burned me once. The water for the matter also gets VERY VERY hot very quickly. Adrienne was very helpful while we were in NYC despite not being in town herself; she responded quickly to emails asking for help (i.e. we couldn't find the log-in information for the wifi). There was a nice welcome package on the kitchen table with little bits of information about the city. The kitchen was a good size as well (for the city) and we were able to use the fridge.  Overall it was a perfect place for our trip to NYC and we will DEFINITELY try to use Adrienne's place next time!!"
5172,1125217,13/4/12,229722,Desiree,"Adrienne's apartment was a pleasure to stay in.

5172,1144822,17/4/12,961396,Timo,Fun little apartment in great location! Bed was super comfy and the apt was remarkably quiet. I had a great stay and would love to stay here again.
5172,7073479,5/9/13,461886,Mark,Adrienne's apt was perfect for my NY trip. Her place is conveniently located and the atmosphere of her home is cozy and relaxing. She communicated with me clearly and worked hard to get me the keys when there were last minute conflicts with our travel plans.
5172,7978919,11/10/13,6461313,David,"Nous avons passés une semaine dans cette appartement, il est très bien placé, très propre, le propriétaire est agréable et répond précisément et rapidement au mail, je recommande cette location qui est vraiment irréprochable.
We spent a week in this apartment, it is very well located, very clean, the owner is nice and responds quickly and accurately to the mall, I would recommend this holiday is really impeccable."

In particular it was in a perfect position: silent and comfortable for visiting the city.
Even if we did not meet Adrienne, we found her very kind.
"
5172,12132906,23/4/14,13934057,Dhruv,"We stayed at Adrienne’s apartment over the Easter weekend – fabulous apartment, amazing location and all very convenient. Highly recommended. As other reviewers have pointed out earlier, the bed is very comfortable! Loads of good restaurants a short walk away and ideal for sightseeing in Manhattan. Much, much better than a hotel. While we did not meet Adrienne, she was very polite and quick to respond to emails - a very pleasant experience. "
5172,12760525,10/5/14,96001,Holly,"Quiet slice of Manhattan sums it up.   This apartment is quieter than most NY hotels.   I enjoyed the garden views out back and slept like a baby in that comfortable bed.  I loved Adrienne's sticky notes placed around the apartment to help navigate the new environment, super helpful.  
Adrienne was a pleasure and always quick to respond via text or email.  A great value in the big apple.

5172,14084982,11/6/14,14819194,Auralia,"Adrienne's apartment was the perfect Manhattan location for us. It was a lovely and quiet refuge in a great walkable neighbourhood. Her helpful welcome package was an added bonus, and she was prompt and great with communications. We didn't want to leave!"
5172,38428635,15/7/15,36894213,Anne,"Location, location, location!
Adrienne's place suited us perfectly. We appreciated  the air conditioning in the bedroom,  the comfy bed, the breakfast makings and also Perk  Cafe's letting us hand in our keys before opening time so we could get to the  airport  in time for our flight. We will recommend  Adrienne's place to our friends."
5172,68590698,5/4/16,14600445,Tom,I didn't meet Adrienne but the apartment was just as described and a nice place to be for my short stay. The bedroom backs onto the yard so is quiet. There is a nice character to the place and the bedroom-kitcken-bathroom setup had all that I needed.
5172,69530461,11/4/16,10292753,Keren,"The apartment was just as described, wonderful location, very sweet place, though not much light. Adrianne was very kind and friendly on the phone. Make sure to ask Adrianne in the close-by key cafe' as in my case she wasn't sure I would get there on time, and left it at a 24h cafe' which was 22 blocks away. "
5172,72426417,2/5/16,42955988,Joanna,"While I didn't get to meet Adrienne, she called me the afternoon we were checking in and we just missed each other! She put a lot of thought into making sure we had everything we needed and there were plenty of clean fresh towels and helpful notes. The space was big enough and a great location. I would recommend staying here. "
5172,73714871,9/5/16,1640315,Raevv'n,"OH MY GOD LOCATION!!! Adrienne's place was an absolute delight. The size of it was cozy, and it had such a warm atmosphere to it. Me and my childhood best friend stayed at Adrienne's for a weekend in Manhattan and as two young women alone in a big city we never felt unsafe. The location was perfect. In New York you're going to be walking quite a lot, and Adrienne's place was just enough downtown that you felt like you were really getting the experience of the city that never sleeps but not too downtown that you didn't feel like it was your home to rest at, at the end of a long day. Only thing was we, personally, found that it was hot in the apartment at night, but having the window open while we slept fixed that right away! Adrienne's apartment had ANYTHING you might've forgotten to bring as well (we forgot to bring our blow dryer, and hair straightener). She really made us feel like we were staying at a home away from home. Adrienne was extremely kind, and responsive to all questions and enquiry's that we had. We will definitely be booking with Adrienne again when we decide to return back to this amazing city. Thanks for everything!! "
5172,74750141,16/5/16,67103962,Amy,"Our stay was great. The apartment was clean and just enough space for my friend and I. Adrienne was even accommodating to our flight time for checkout.

Very clean house, good contact with the owner,  smooth transfer with the keys. Good airco to cool the place. The owner left a map with information and a lot of things to do in New York. There only wasn't muts sunlight what made the apartment a bit dark. Also there was no space in a closet to put your stuff in. "

The size was more than comfortable for 2 people and it was clean as well as described and pictured accurately.  We spent a lot of time in other areas (Chelsea, West Village, East Village) as Murray Hill is very post graduate, young, etc but we could get to other areas with ease and come back to a safe, clean, affordable apartment in the middle of Manhattan!

Nonostante non sia stato possibile incontrarci la comunicazione è stata ottima e di grandissimo aiuto: Adrienne è assolutamente presente anche quando non lo è fisicamente! L'appartamento è stato pulito il giorno prima del nostro arrivo da un servizio di pulizie perciò era assolutamente impeccabile. Il quartiere è assolutamente il migliore di NY: bar,ristoranti e pub sono a portata di mano ed anche i suggerimenti dell'host sono stati utilissimi. Appartamento assolutamente consigliato per chi viaggia solo o in coppia."

5172,163403544,24/6/17,129466308,Vane,"La estancia en la casa de Adrienne ha estado muy bien, es una casa con todo lo necesario para vivir, esta a tres calles de la parada de metro y es una zona tranquila. Lo recomiendo"
5172,172024047,19/7/17,21377535,Dejerrica,"Perrrrrfect stay at adriennes!!! 

It was a new York experience I have always dreamed of, honwstly.... Everything was the way I keep things so it felt like home, clean and cozy, colors & decor that I love on the walls, and else where books I enjoyed reading bits of, perfect water pressure, fluffy towels, comfortable bed, nice sheets, wood floors, I felt so secure even with no being used to the way the AC unit is set up, etc.... No televisions was
Even perfect but if a person can't go without there is WiFi with high speed connection

I could go on about how great my stay was"
5172,173581435,23/7/17,7815873,Apolonia,"Adrienne's place is wonderful. We stayed for 4 days and it was exactly as described: clean, central, and comfortable! I hope to be back soon and definitely will recommend it to anyone going to NYC. Thanks again Adrienne!"
5172,176244192,30/7/17,43191110,Michael,The location was in a very quiet location and everything seems to be very walking distance so it's great 
5172,194360816,16/9/17,2340924,Ann,Adrienne's place is a wonderful place to stay just as in the pictures  It was very clean and she has it well organized (Website hidden by Airbnb) is in a great location and was close enough to walk to the United Nations Headquarters. The host Adrienne was great at communications and returned messages very quickly. We would definitely book her place again.
5172,196015903,21/9/17,35410907,Gemma,"This was a real find. Adrianne was very helpful. nice apartment, very useful for being near the UN on a budget. thanks Adrienne for making it possible for us to check out at 5am!"
5172,198801472,30/9/17,32368835,Dan,"Great location!  Very quiet! Excellent value.

There's no TV and at times the Internet can be terribly slow but if you're out and about most days and nights, you'll hardly even notice (or care) :-)

Adrienne is friendly and communicative and was an excellent host.  Would definitely recommend."
5172,202037527,9/10/17,42311464,Gerald,"Adrienne's place is perfect! And you can not beat the location! Crosstown bus is around the corner and just a 5 minute walk to Grand Central. I was able to get around the city super easily. The place is obviously her actual home and not a hotel style environment. Which makes the atmosphere feel warm and welcoming. It's away from the street so it was very quiet at night. There was instant hot water in the shower too. I did not get to meet Adrienne directly, but her instructions for the key exchange was super simple. Thank you so much for hosting me! I will definitely look you up again in the future!"
5172,242853662,13/3/18,6809309,Alex,"A fantastic apartment to stay in while exploring New York. Felt like a home away from home. It was quiet, great location to walk to trendy or tourist areas and the apartment had all the amenities you could wish for. Kitchen is fully functional, bathroom is kitted out and the bed was very comfortable. Adrienne was very accommodating with checkin and checkout and great at communicating quickly. I would certainly stay here again if I come back to New York."
5172,256298175,22/4/18,184502444,Shannon,"Adrienne is a great host!  She was very helpful and responsive to your questions even though we never meet face to face.  Her place is cute, cozy, clean and is in an great neighborhood in NYC.  We thought the location was perfect with everything you need nearby - just the kind of NY experience we were looking for.  We hope to go back again someday and spend more time."
5172,260372929,4/5/18,99899361,Hilary,"Adrienne’s place is really well located for those wanting to explore local attractions. It is walking distance to the UN, Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Chrysler Building, and Grand Central Station. Very easy to get around, and a very comfortable place to stay. Also, convenient key pick-up and drop-off through use of key cafe. Highly recommend."
5172,261528241,6/5/18,41057133,Kristi,Adrienne was a great host. Super helpful and promptly answered any questions we had. The location itself is also very close to everything.
5172,265008307,15/5/18,52080183,Marie,Adrien is a very good host. The flat is Cosy and perfectly located to visit NY. I am recommending it.
5172,267713659,22/5/18,127523201,Robert,"Great location. Ground floor entrance.
Lots of good places to eat nearby."
5172,270226976,28/5/18,160456354,Matthew,"Fantastic spot in Murray Hill. It truly is much bigger than it appears, comfy bed, and no complaints whatsoever. Would highly recommend "
5172,281283167,24/6/18,150154089,Cynthia,"Es justo lo que viene en la foto. Super buena atención limpio, céntrico, solo. No microondas y no tv."
5172,284489159,1/7/18,3337144,Benno,"Adriennes place is very nice, and perfectly located to explore NYC. It was larger than expected, had a very comfy bed and all the amenities needed for a perfect stay. And the communication along the way was outstanding with very rapid responses to any questions. I highly recommend this place!"
5172,289998590,13/7/18,81989165,James,"Place was fantastic.
Absolutely would recommend.

Location fantastic but still quiet."
5172,295447663,23/7/18,63154981,Fan,Cool accommodation. Nicely furnished. Though a little bit far from subway station.「About ten minutes walk」
5172,297307956,27/7/18,51757932,Robin,"Adrienne's communication was fantastic and her place was so comfortable and convenient!  Everything was just as described and the location was perfect for getting anywhere (a short walk from Grand Central, and lots of restaurant choices, Trader Joe's, etc. right in the neighborhood).  The bed was superb (comfort of mattress, pillows, and linens) and the apartment itself was full of thoughtful touches and so peaceful - as it's on the back of the building all we heard in the evenings was birds going to sleep in the courtyard, and seeing green trees out the window was really refreshing.  Definitely the most peaceful nights I have ever had in NYC!  Key pickup and drop off from a lockbox was secure and convenient.  I can't recommend Adrienne highly enough as a hostess."
5172,305595596,11/8/18,159587772,Alex,"Adrienne is an immensely considerate, thoughtful and helpful host. She is extremely communicative and quick to reply if any issues arrive. She also goes above and beyond what is normally expected in ensuring that guests feel completely at home (even including a small box of emergency toiletries in case guests have forgotten any!). The apartment is very good value considering the excellent location and the space it provides. All in all, I recommend this apartment extremely highly!"
5172,309037098,17/8/18,436773,Sonya,"We enjoyed our stay in this centrally located apartment, which is very quiet and has an excellent bed.    It was very clean and had all the amenities we needed.  It is also an excellent value.  Adrienne was able to accomodate our last minute request to come a day early and was easy to communicate with.  FYI the key pick up is about 8-9 blocks away, so plan a little extra time for that when you arrive and depart.  The only negative  is that there is little natural light, at least in the summer, as it is a ground floor apartment.  However we were out and about during the day, so it was not a problem for us."
5178,2091,6/5/09,8443,Dimitri,"MR. Kasai was a grreat host , very helpful and hospitable , this room is really great value considering comfort and location , the only drawback is the street noise ;"
5178,3015,23/5/09,15642,Duong,The room is great and the hosts are superb!!
5178,4019,14/6/09,19644,Jim,"Very good experience. The room is clean, quiet (separated from the main living area) and centrally located in midtown Manhattan. I would recommend this room."
5178,5138,6/7/09,18347,Enki,"i agree with other reviewers in that the location is superb and the host is nice (total privacy is guaranteed), but i would not recommend this room if you're sensitive to noises (i felt as if i was sleeping in the center of the 8th avenue) and smell of smoking like myself. Especially, i barely slept due to the noises (construction, buses, fights of drunken men and women all night) ... i think that it might be because of the way air conditioner is attached to the window."
5178,8211,24/8/09,32936,Tomas,"Absolutely excellent. Couldnt have found a better room. Quiet, centrally located, clean and with more than enough personal space. Shun is a gracious host, and any person who chooses to stay here will not regret it!"
5178,8365,27/8/09,29676,Lukas,"nice and clean, good location"
5178,12867,9/10/09,31242,Michael,"Can't say enough positive things about this place and about Shunichi (Shun) and Akiko, especially for the VERY REASONABLE price.   Shun is a gracious and unobtrusive host.  He even offered to connect his extra laptop for me to have web access to look up theater times, museum info, etc.  The microwave, refrigerator, and flat panel TV (with cable) are all great amenities.  The street noise is really no big deal considering the very, very convenient 2nd floor location.  The noise is typical for New York.  Bring ear plugs and a sleeping pill if you really want to be assured a good night's sleep.  (Shun and Akiko, here is my one important suggestion:  Go to IKEA or Bed, Bath & Beyond (or even JCPenney) and get a set of matching sheets, duvet / comforter cover and 2-4 matching pillows and pillowcases.  The sheets,  and especially the pillows,  were sub-standard even at your very competitive rate.  If you do this, you would definitely earn 5-stars from me!  Thanks again for a fantastic stay overall!  You guys were wonderful!!"
5178,16180,4/11/09,23681,Eddie,"What a wonderful experience.  WOW!  The host, the apartment, the location, the price.  I could not have asked for a nicer, cleaner, more hospitable place and host.  If and when I return to NYC, I do hope this is still available.  If not, how sad for me.  Thank you for making my trip such a positive and enjoyable experience.  "
5178,19212,5/12/09,56221,Arthur,Had a nice quiet time at the apartment.  I got lots of privacy and the LOCATION was fabulous!  Can't beat it!
5178,19726,9/12/09,57415,Carole,"My three nights at the 55th Street room were perfect.  Shun met me as soon as I arrived on his doorstep. He showed me in and left me alone.  He seemed to understand from the moment I got there what I wanted and needed.  The room is clean and comfortable.  The down comforter and flat screen were more than I ever expected.  The tea and cocoa were perfect for the times I came in for a rest from my long walks on the sidewalks of my favorite city. The apartment is just three blocks from Columbus Circle,  and just a few blocks to the Theatre District.  There are good places to eat very near by. The bakery around the corner on Eighth Ave was very good and Luigi’s Pizza across the avenue was a favorite of my teenage son’s last time we were there as a family.  I was able to live like a New Yorker for those three days and it was exactly what I needed.  I will definitely stay with Shun and Akiko again when I come to NYC. I recommend this accommodation to anyone who wants to experience living in NYC, not just visiting.  I know this neighborhood well, having lived there in the 80’s, and I could not have asked for more. It was like being home, only a lot better, because I was unfettered and able to do exactly what I wanted.  I can’t wait to go back again. Thank you, Shun!  "
5178,23551,7/1/10,64742,Shahar,"the room is very nice and warm. the hosts are realy nice and friendly. the location of the place is great, close to all the places we wanted to visit in n.y and to the subway. highly recomended "
5178,24797,24/1/10,66519,Jeff,"My hosts were the best. Very clean, great location and made certain to meet me on arrival to insure I had what I needed and provided complete privacy, service and more than what I'd hoped to find. As a frequent business traveler for years it is now my preferred location and choice in NY. I will stay here again and highly recommend this to all of my contacts, friends and family.

"
5178,29344,14/3/10,35310,Serdar,"The apartment is not the place shown in the pictures, it was not clean, never met Akiko only her friend (Website hidden by Airbnb) unfortunetly I have nothing positive to say about my stay.  Sorry, but I feel cheated!! "
5178,33818,6/4/10,37224,Steffen,"It was very pleasant stay in New York. Shun is a great host and I would come back anytime. The Appartement is a nice one and equipped with everything you need (microwave, fast internet, cable tv etc.) Thank you Shun, it was a nice week in New York!"
5178,34688,10/4/10,103590,Tom,"I also had a great time in NYC and the apartment is well situated near the center (Times Square  / Central Park) and Columbus subway station.
Shun and Akika were pleasant and although I came in late every night they hadn't an issue and even allowed me a late checkout.
Apart from what Steffen F. mentioned you also have a working window Air Conditioner (AC) in the room - much needed for the upcoming summer.
One comment is that the bed is a standard ""Double"" Width - 55"" / 1.4meter which is nice and large for a Single.
Thanks Shun for a great ""In Manhattan"" option and allowing me in so late at night, I do hope to stay again ;)."
5178,35310,13/4/10,49565,Lance,I also had a great time in NYC and the apartment gave me what I wanted and needed.  Thank you Shun.
5178,37168,22/4/10,78096,Lourdes,"My friend and I had an amazing time in NYC thanks to the hospitality of Mr. Shun and Akiko. We were given more than ample privacy, the house rules were VERY reasonable. The room, bed, linens, and shared bathroom was clean. They were very kind and welcoming and we would recommend them to anyone who's looking for a great place, in a great location, at a very reasonable price."
5178,38906,30/4/10,100740,Juliana,"Great location in Manhattan, next to everything. Apartment a little bit old, and noisy, but it is Manhattan, so what do you expect? For the price I found it perfect!
Shun is very nice, he also helped us with our baggage, he purt water for us in the fridge (there is a little fridge and microwave in the bedroom)
We loved our stay in Shun apartment."
5178,50984,8/6/10,104290,Tara,"Really excellent location. Only a few blocks from Columbus Circle metro station and the 51st St station. Tons of great restaurants near by and even closer to the attractions than I expected. The room is very spacious and didn't feel like I was living out of a hotel room and it had a tea pot, microwave, and fridge.Provides towels and toiletries. I only saw Shun twice in 6 days so it was very private. Shun was very nice and I will stay here again on my next trip to NY. High recommend! "
5178,51656,10/6/10,105878,Anne,"Very kind and hospitable. Of course the location is great for everything.
the room was spacious and included internet, and cooking possibilities.
i would definitely return."
5178,54538,18/6/10,409,Mathieu,"Fantastic location, very private, I came and went as I pleased. Aircon was a blessing, and the internet fast as well. I would stay there again!"
5178,69674,27/7/10,106633,Flore,"We stayed at Shun's place for a week in july. His flat is EXTREMELY well located (5minutes walking from Times square and central park). It's also very close to the metro (didn't have to make any transfer in the subway during the week). Shun is nice, very discreet. Privacy garanteed. 
The bad point of being so well located is that it's very noisy, even during the night. The room was ok but not perfectly clean (dirty dishes, earings in the sheets, dust, ...). 
We do still recommand this place because of the price, and also of the location. "
5178,73918,5/8/10,122207,Barbara,"It is a perfect place to visit NY; all interesting places are near by, or you can use the subway. The room is ok, the bed is for one people very big :-)
The only thing I did`nt like; the bathroom was dirty."
5178,80630,18/8/10,118953,Damien,"chambre tres bien située, du bruit mais c'est normal on est en plein Manhatan. Le propriétaire est tres discret je vous le recommande tres bonne adresse"
5178,83832,24/8/10,157885,Anil,"Host promptly and politely replied to all of our inquiries, and the room was simply furnished, but clean and comfortable.  The Midtown location is superb and we highly recommend this apartment.  Thanks Shun!"
5178,89441,3/9/10,144158,Javier,"This is a private room in a shared apartment with the host. 
Is very well located, close to subway station in a very safety neighbourhood, lots of dinners, restaurants, drugstores nearby. 

The host wakes up early to work, and as I went out and return late in the evening, it was like having a not shared apartment. 

Very clean and confortable. Bathroom in excellent conditions.

Totally recommended."
5178,94059,10/9/10,98356,Amaury,"Oh my god ! Shun is an amazing host, very careful gives you all you need (towels, shampoo, internet adapter,...). The room is great and it has airco which is a real blessing in the deep heat summer of Manhattan! The location is amzing (a few blocks from Central Park, Time Square, MoMA and a lot of local amenties...) T
I would recommend it to any couple that wanna visit NYC ! I'll definatly go back there !!"
5178,103749,24/9/10,121514,Ashanti,"I recently stayed at Shun's apartment (Sept 2010).
The apartment is perfectly located in the heart of Manhattan. It is a close walking distance to times square, and major subways that makes commuting around NY very easy.
I was in NY to take dance classes, and Shun's apartment was perfectly located within walkiing distance to Broadway Dance Centre (10-15mins), Steps on Broadway (20 mins) and Ailey Dance Centre (5-10 mins).  
Shun was very hospitable allowing me to use his lap top and internet.  The room was spacious and entirely adequate as I only came back late at night to sleep for a few hours. The facilities were clean and adequate.
Yes it can be a little noisy at nigh which made sleeping a little difficult, but the room, its location and the hosts were exactly what i needed for this trip.  
I would thoroughly recommend this apartment to any single or couple looking to stay somewhere convenient in NY."
5178,113348,7/10/10,83244,Christophe,"I was in NYC from the 23rd Sept to the 06th Oct 2010. I had a great trip to NYC. The building is an old construction, one block away the famous and new Hearst Tower. Market open 24h one block away and more than 3 subway line 5 mins walking. The appartment is quite simple but with everything. Shun was a nice host, keeping your privacy and always helping. The appartment is 15 mins walking from 6th ave, Rockeffeler, Grand Army, Times Sq, 5 mins of Columbus Circle and Central Park ... Great ... In the heart of Midtown. Hope to come again soon."
5178,115787,11/10/10,116623,Maria,"Fantastic apartment, fantastic location and fantastic Shun. I´ll go back. Un excelente trato y muy respetuoso con nuestra privacidad. Gracias Shun "
5178,122987,20/10/10,156379,Pablo,"It was my first experience in Airbnb and was perfect. 

Shun was very helpful and he was in his own world so the life in the apartment was like I had my own apartment.

The apartment was clean, close to everything and I didn´t miss anything. It´s a good option if you don´t want luxury and you want a good place for a good price."
5178,127406,26/10/10,159969,Melissa+Ryan,"Shun was a gracious host, the room was as advertised and very clean was in a good part of manhattan which made our trip very enjoyable, would stay with shun again"
5178,136569,10/11/10,125337,Michelle,"
Shun place is fantastic! Everything from clean towels, to toiletries was provided. 
Place is accessible to many prime location. No doubt it is noisy at times, but it is still a place which I would strongly recommend. 

- maybe it will be great to have a full length mirror in the room.

- would also be great to have a small stool at the shoes area. 

Still, Shun is a helpful host whom doesn't have much restriction and respects the privacy of his guest. 

Thumbs up and highly recommended. 

Thank you Shun. 



"
5178,143980,24/11/10,225066,Elaine,Shun is very nice and quiet.  I had a great week of staying at his place. Big individual room with all facilities.  I love to come back again in future. The only thing to improve is the cigrate smell from his room.  It's separated from the rental room but the smell can travel to the whole place.  Shun should buy a airfilter to put in his room.  It will be a better environment. 
5178,144935,26/11/10,294291,Andrew,"Shun was a great host!! Spent a few days before thanksgiving.  Right in the middle of Midtown West.  Close to everything!! I didn't see Shun much, the room is very private.  Would rent from again next time in NYC!"
5178,153602,14/12/10,182487,Raquel,"Shun's appartment is in an excellent location. We had our privacy and the room was exactly as show on the photo. Very basic but clean. We probably only saw Shun 2 or 3 times during our stay. It was our first visit to New York and it would have been appreciated if Shun had at least on one occasion (perhaps upon arrival or the day after) offered some information about the area or check with us if we had any questions. We thought Shun was friendly but very reserved .Bottom line: great location, close to places of interest (we practically walked everywhere), clean but basic accommodation, however, don't expect a social, interactive host because once you've checked-in, you're on your own! Not an unpleasant experience overall."
5178,154880,17/12/10,172204,Bernard,"Great stay at Shun's apartment.  GREAT location, within walking distance of Times Square and a host of other attractions.  Spacious room, nicely warm despite frigid weather.  Lots of privacy, great internet connection.  Also lots of good inexpensive restaurants around.  I especially enjoyed a Cuban place around the corner with great Cuban jazz."
5178,155771,19/12/10,11327,Tippy,"This was our first time using airbnb and we couldn't be anymore thrilled we did. For the price and the location Shun's place was definitely worth it. We were within walking distance to everything, the subway was only 2 blocks north, along with columbus circle, central park and the time warner building. We only had to walk less than 8 mins to Radio City and rockefeller center. 
We had our own keys and could come and go as freely as we wanted. We had even came in really late a couple times. And we only saw Shun 2 times during the stay. 
We would definitely stay here again if we were to visit NY. Thanks!"
5178,157407,23/12/10,244211,Paola,"Shun is very kind and excellent host. The place is big and walking distance from Central Park and Times Square, we really enjoyed our time in NYC and we'll definitely recommend Shun's apartment. Thank you very much for everything!"
5178,164743,4/1/11,139152,Lianna & Adlan,"We would stay here again with Shun.  Perfect location for NYC, easy to get around on foot and subway (5min walk to closest subway).  24hr conveient store downstairs, bottle shop, pharmacy not far.  Shun was very quiet and kept to himself.  For what you pay, I couldn't ask for anything else.  Our plane was delayed because of the blizzard and didn't arrive till late at night.  He let us in and made us a coffee!  "
5178,167058,6/1/11,321907,Shin Gern,"I personally think that this apartment is a total worth of it's money. Yes, you could get an apartment which is halve it's price, but Shun keeps his place perfectly clean and provides many unexpected ammenities! Being a 3 street walk away from the Colombus Circle Subway, it's surrounding area's are brightly lit even after midnight.  "
5178,169667,12/1/11,125217,Danyah,"Shun's place is ideal for a short break to New York - just a 10 minute walk or less to times square and maybe 5 minutes to central park. Safe neighbourhood to walk around in at night. Room is fine, TV with a few channels and a desk there. bathroom is also fine. didnt really see that much of Shun as we were out exploring most of the time!! thanks for a plesant stay! if i come to NY again I would defo go bak there!
he also seems to be very popular as others had just left as we got there and some more people were arriving as we left!!"
5178,170545,14/1/11,203342,James,Though I did not stay there I give Shun 5 stars! My flight was cancelled 2 days in a row due to a major snow storm and Shun was very nice about the whole thing. He could not have been more understanding with each call. I have him saved to my favorites for my next trip I will stay with him if its available. Thanks Shun!
5178,170955,16/1/11,294927,Azrina,"This was an excellent place to stay! Its close to all NYC's attractions and doorstep away from the high end of Fifth Ave and Central Park. It is also very convenient to the subway.  Room as big and clean, with all the necessities you need. Highly recommended."
5178,176140,30/1/11,93888,Charles,"Great location, flexible host, basic accommodation."
5178,178104,4/2/11,329867,Michael,"Great location. Its a real short walk to several neighborhood resturants on 9th! Basic room, but was perfect!"
5178,179393,7/2/11,211891,Mackline,"Shun's place was a great place to move around in the city.  It's about 15 mins by train to 34th street or Times square station.  There is couple of restaurants around the corner and pharmacy for all your immediate needs.  Shun was very flexible accomodating me as I was later than expected due to travel complications.  He waited at the apartment to receive me.  He even grabbed my bags up to the second floor. The main entrance is a small hallway that leads to the two rooms. If you a tad bit alergic to dust , you should not stay here.  Otherwise, the room is very large, with a small working fridge, microwave and lots of channels for cable.  This kitchen is a bit odd to use since it is in the host's living area and you would be separated by a glass door.  If you are there for a short stay then eating out and buying things that can be reheated would work best.  Although, Shun said that if I needed a cup or plate from the kitchen I was free to use which was nice of him.  The hosts were very quiet all weekend I really didn't see them.  Although, if I needed something I'm sure I could have asked.  I would say location-wise and room needs this was a decent place."
5178,188631,26/2/11,285023,Manon,"It was a perfect location. Near Central Park, Times Square, Subway station... Everything was perfect in the room and very well furnished. I highly recommend this place. This is an address I keep in my contacts for a future travel to NYC!"
5178,190162,28/2/11,55455,Omar,"Stayed here from feb 25th to 27th. Was my first visit to NYC. The pictures reflect what you get. The location is amazing as you are close to Time Square, Central park, 5th avenue, metro,etc... So for what you pay it's a great place to stay... But it's not a hotel... The inside of the building is not the greatest and in an OK condition. 

The Host was really quite, friendly and very helpful. You have a tv with a good selection of channels, wired interenet, a table, a chair and a stool. The bed is comfy.

I enjoyed my stay there but I would probably stay in a hotel next time. If you are looking to save money then this is the place to be. If you an afford the extra 40 dollars/night then go for a hotel room.

5178,194417,8/3/11,311594,Justine,"Première fois à New York et très bon séjour ! L'appartement de Shun est vraiment bien situé, à proximité de tout et la chambre est plutôt grande et confonrtable. De plus le métro est à côté donc c'est également très pratique pour aller dans les lieux à visiter qui n'étaient pas proche. Times Square et Central park à côté ! Et enfin Shun est vraiment très gentil et discret. Il était là si nous avions des questions. Encore merci à lui pour ce très bon séjour, nous recommandons cet hébergement, si nous devons retourner à New York nous choisirons encore son appartement !"
5178,197093,12/3/11,269438,Keryn,"Previous reviews said it all so I knew what to expect when I arrived. Shun was very accommodating from initial contact to meeting up, making the whole experience hassle free. Perfect location to get around to all the sights and around restaurants/eateries not in the high tourist area. Had a great meal/marguerita at Cancun, just around the corner. The room is as described, handy to have your own fridge/kettle in the room, and great to spread out on the table/chair/shelves/wardrobe so you're not living out of your bag the whole time. Would recommend to others looking for budget accommodation without sacrificing too much."
5178,198656,14/3/11,274106,Jai,"The location is amazing and Shun is a very wonderful host.  The building itself is rather old, like most buildings are in NYC, but you can't beat the price for the location and wonderful host! Thanks Shun!"

5178,216385,4/4/11,264875,Laura,"Great Location, with different subway lines just a couple of blocks walking north or east. Shun was a very quiet host, but that doesn't diminish the great location and accessible price of the place. He  helped me a lot lending me an Apple Express to have wireless wifi while staying there. Really safe neighborhood and got everything near (places to eat, buy food, drug store, shoe repair, Fedex, etc) just by walking. 

This is a perfect choice for people who want to save money and be in a quite central place.

5178,292394,1/6/11,359864,Robin,"We had a nice stay at shun. Location/price are fantastic, nearby columbis circle. Close to a lot of metro stations. The room is good, nothing special. We didn't see Shun very often, only when we arrived. We liked it that way so it was perfect for us. If you want to stay in a clean, central place, with privacy then this is the place to stay."
5178,304929,9/6/11,415158,Julien,"I stayed here 5 days in June 2011.
I had a nice stay at Shun's place and i really enjoyed my stay in NYC.

The location is really great, near Columbus Circle with a lot of subway lines. It's a very convenient  and central place.
The apartment is close to Broadway, Times Square (in a walking distance) etc.  

The room is as described. There is an air conditioner in the room, which is very useful in summer.
The bathroom and the room are quite clean but the apartment and the inside of the building should be refurbished.
Also, as the apartment is very close to 8th Ave., they is some traffic noise. 

I only saw Shun once when I arrived. He was very quiet and respected my privacy. 

For the price, i really think it's a great deal.
Thanks Shun !

The flat is exactly as described; 3 minutes walking to the closest subway station, in a safe and great zone. 
Wifi, microwave, tv and A/C always available inside the room and no problem sharing the bathroom.
Shun waited me when I arrived late night, helping me with the luggage. He has been a very reseved host. 
A perfect experience that I will enjoy again if i go back to NYC.
Thanks Shun"

Though, the room is not so clean and cosy as it looks like on the pictures. The host was friendly to let us in, but we didin't see him the rest of our stay (4 nights). If you want to be left alone during your stay, this is a good alternative. "

There were a few evening we got to say hello and peak our head into his living room to greet his cat. Otherwise, we mostly communicated when we arrived and departed. 
The apartment was clean, especially our room! On top of the cleanliness, his place is in a great location. It could not have been better. There were little grocery stores, places to eat, wonderful galleries, and central park all located in a close vicinity to his place! 
We definitely recommend staying with Shun! 
"
5178,624967,13/10/11,637612,Jesús,"Situacion estupenda, el anfitrion fue amable aunque solo lo vimos el dia de llegada y el de salida. Por otro lado tanto la limpieza, mobiliario e intalaciones de la casa tercermundistas totalmente. El baño y la habitacion estaba super sucio y durante los 12 dias de estancia ni tan siquiera se nos ofrecio un cambio de toallas o sabanas.

5178,630702,16/10/11,981049,Charlotte,"This place was really central, just 5-1minute walk to time square which was great. The place was less clean then expected, but the room was reasonably spacious with it's own fridge, cutlery & table. Shun was quite a private guy, we didn't see him much. Overall reasonable for the price, thanks Shun."
5178,644485,19/10/11,521606,Lyn,"Shun is so kind, the room is big (he kindly put an extra mattress for a third person) and is really comfortable. The bathroom was always clean and available and he offers everything you can need. The location is the best, you are close to everything, just two blocks of the nearest subway and in the area are plenty of delis so you can eat cheap and on the go. Only one thing, try to visit NY without many lugage, because travelling on the subway, streets or taking luggage trough the stairs, is not so nice if you have big pieces. 
I definitely recommend Shun if you are lucky enough to find availability in his appartment.

"

Shun was rarely ever home, but very nice.  He let me store my luggage for about 4 hours after check out because I didn't want to lug it around.  I would stay here again for sure."
5178,697252,7/11/11,744809,Jana,"Having booked the first time with airbnb we were happy that our host and room was as described earlier. Shun is a friendly guy who still was preparing our room when we arrived an hour  early as announced. The room was large enough for two, has fridge and sat TV. Shun provided WIfi and wired internet access. The clean room itself is located near a subway which makes going with metro very easy. We have been a lot around in manhattan and enjoyed our stay for sleep and a shower at Shun. Near to this room we suggest a visit at Carnegie Deli for breakfast. Thanx Shun for beeing our host."

5178,781890,13/12/11,870987,Caitlin,"Fantastic location! Shun was very accommodating with arrival times and showed us around the apartment when we arrived. Room is quite large, well heated, and has great amenities (fridge, microwave, kettle). Most of the time we did not even see the hosts, as they kept to themselves or were at work. Only problem we had was getting the shower to stay at a decent temperature as it tended to be too hot or cold. Otherwise was a great experience, would definitely recommend!  "
5178,798934,21/12/11,882170,Eric,"Great location, walking distance to Columbus Circle, Central Park and Times Square. Subway is just one block away. If you're a tourist and doing things til late night, you can easily go back to the room. 
There's also plenty of 24hr food in the neighborhood. 
The internet is fast & reliable.
The plumbing is old, so getting the water to stay at the temperature you want can be a bit tricky. But it's a minor issue. "
5178,840106,6/1/12,691172,Gustavo,"The bedroom is all that someone could ask to explore the best highlights of Times Square and surroundings and is very close to the subway, providing access to the whole metropolitan area. It is very simple, but has everything one need to a good staying. Shunichi is concerned in providing a good accomodation and was available when requested. "
5178,852090,9/1/12,1456486,Vivian,"My sister and I stayed in Shun's apt for 4 nights.  The room is indeed located in a prime location - super convenient for any tourist needs and close to Times Square.  Also located very close to a metro stop so getting around is very simple.  

The room itself was nice and plain.  It is also adequately warm.  There was a microwave, fridge, closet space, desk and even an extra heater.  The bed and pillows were a little hard -- but spacious.  The traffic outside can get a little loud.  Like previous reviews, the hot water in the shower is a bit tricky, but I didn't have too much trouble figuring out how to get it to work.

Shun is pretty private but is always ready to assist and help accomodate any needs/requests.  We were usually gone all day so there was minimal interaction with the host.  

The overal experience was very positive and if I ever need lodgings in Manhattan again, I would definitely see if Shun's place is up for grabs.  The only real criticism I have is that I didn't find the bed/pillows very comfortable (My sister said she liked firmer beds, so it's just a preference).  "
5178,872866,20/1/12,1430948,Dale,"Because I was in NYC in January specifically to see a number of shows (8!) and visit MOMA, the Guggenheim and the new World Trade Center memorial, staying at Shunichi's was perfect for me.  The room was warm and comfortable.  The small refrigerator and microwave were extremely helpful in keeping expenses down.  (Shun offers access to his kitchen off the main living room but I never used it, except to wash a few dishes.)  There is a TV, and the bed is large and cozy.  The bathroom is nice, and the shower is very good.  One irony is that, after an initial meeting with Shun during which he gave me a friendly orientation to the room and the apartment, I only caught brief glimpses of him for the next 9 days.  He was off to work by 8:00 a.m. and came home usually late so I had almost no contact with him!  For someone like me, seeking a warm abode while spending most days and many evenings out and about in Manhattan and Brooklyn, it was an extremely economical way to visit NYC and stay in a very central location (Website hidden by Airbnb)"

If you are a busy traveler, who will be most likely spending time outside (especially downtown Manhattan) and wants to have privacy and spend quite time for good rest at the end of the day at the place you stay, his place will be the perfect choice for you. The stuffs I listed under [What I did not like] should be considered as minor issues. My overall experience was very positive. 

[What I liked]
(1) Location was truly AMAZING. You cannot ask for more. Very close to Columbus Circle subway station and there were many little places to grab something to eat. There are 24 hours McDonald, Starbucks, 24 hours grocery store, Central Park, Shopping Mall and so on very close by. (2) Shun was a wonderful host. He is very flexible, kind, and communicative. He adjusted check-in, check-out time for me and even took care of my luggage on the day I was supposed to check out because I had to wait until 6PM to get in to the next accommodation arrangement. (3) Wireless Internet works very well, and TV in the room has many channels you can enjoy while you are in your room, (4) Fridge, microwave, some plates, and flatware in the room come extremely handy when you want to keep some drinks cold and have little snack without having to use the kitchen

[What I did not like]
(1) It was very tricky to use shower temperature control. The water becomes easily too cold or hot. (2) Lighting in the room was bit dark to me (3) No mirror in the room (4) Heating system was broken at the time I stayed, so I had to use Shun's small portable heater that was not strong enough"
5178,960866,1/3/12,614383,Eliezer,"Esta fue mi segunda estadia usando AirBnB, y al igual que la primera estubo tal cual esperaba. 

Shun fue muy buen afitrion, algo privado pero siempre dispuesto ayudar a hacer la estadia una placentera.
El cuarto es tal cual se describe. Limpio, comodo y te sientes como en tu casa.
Aunque queda frente a la calle, el ruido de los autos y algunas veces las sirenas no fue ningun problema para descansar.
La cama la encontre comoda igual que las almohadas y frisas.

Algunos lugares a la vuelta de la esquina para que consideren comer:
1. Matts Burger
2. Bread Co
3. El restaurant Thailandes de la esquina (al lado de Matts Burger)

De nuevo, tres cosas para considerar este APT.
1.Localizacion
2.Precio
3.Comodidad (TV, Horno Microondas, Agua Caliente, escritorio, Internet, Closet para la ropa)

Espero que su estadia en NY se placentera como lo fue la mia.

The room is large for NY standards, the location is amazing, there's a fridge, microwave, dishes, tea, and water kettle.  And towels.  The room isn't perfectly clean like a hotel, but it's like staying in a friend's house.  The building is old and a little worn, but the neighborhood is great and you can easily walk to central park, delis, subways, and tons of other food.  "

5178,1147766,18/4/12,1786924,Andre,"Took my girlfriend to New York for her birthday since I wanted to propose to her and New York was the place went to for our 1st date.  I wanted somewhere that was in a decent area, not pricy and within a good distance of all the Manhattan attractions.  

A friend on (Hidden by Airbnb) told me about this site because the prices for hotels were ridiculous.  I came across this posting and it was great.  Right off of 8th Ave, less than 5 blocks to beautiful Central Park and not far from Times Square and Penn Station.  If walking doesn't bother you and you want to fit in like a New Yorker, you can definitely get around to all the attractions without having to pay for a taxi or taking the subways.  My girlfriend and I had a great time!  

The room is not luxurious, but if you want a secure place to rest your head at night and still be in the main area of Times Square, it is perfect. There is a fridge, microwave, TV and DVD player in the room, and also free wi-fi for those who need to access the internet.  I have no complaints other than it being a little hot in the room because the weather was nice when we were there.  Other than not having a fan in the room, everything else was great."

5178,1260860,11/5/12,1596174,Phil,"I arrived right around the time that I arranged with Shun to be there. Shun came down to the door and let me in. Perhaps he did this in order to lead me directly to the apartment the first time, as I might conceivably have gotten confused as to where the apartment is, due to the stairway and apartment layout. Anyway, first appearances of the building might be scary for some. It is rather run down. Indeed, the apartment must not have enough storage space because there are boxes lining the hallway leading to the main part of the apartment. The room is very basic, but is as advertised. There is a small refrigerator, some dishes and a microwave, a TV and WiFi. The apartment could use a cosmetic facelift, for sure, but apart from that, it was comfortable enough, though spartan. After introductions, I didn't see Shun again until shortly before I left. All in all, though I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for everyone, I would definitely return due to the convenience of location. Shun is pleasant, very quiet and reliable."
5178,1301779,19/5/12,1523333,Fabio,Great host. I and my wife love each moment. Shun is a great host and your house has great localization.
5178,1349398,26/5/12,1718750,Anna Marie,"The big plus regarding Shun's apartment is the amazing location in the near of the central park, the MoMa and Times Square.  If you are a good walker, you can do a lot of things even without taking a taxi or the subway. Otherwise, a lot of subway stations are nearby. The apartment is none too cozy, but it is big and very private and you have everything in it you need (Wifi, dishes, fridge etc) and by the way, you will hardly find an accommodation in this area which offers you all this and still is affordable.  We really had a great time in New York!"

Die Wohnung liegt in einer absolut großartigen Lage. Der Gastgeber ist höflich und hilfsbereit ohne sich auf zu drängen. Privatsphäre ist garantiert. 
Besonders freuten wir uns auch über die flexiblen Check-in und check-out Zeiten (wir hatten Glück und niemand checkte aus oder ein, als wir ankamen und abreisten). 
Absolut zu empfehlen!"

5178,1945975,11/8/12,285361,Melissa,"As Shun has advertised, it's a very basic, no-frills room. Good value for the location! Shun was polite and we had no issues with him as far as timing/picking up keys/communication was concerned.  "

5178,2295972,15/9/12,1754564,Lisa,"We've already stayed five times with airbnb and this was definitely the worst!
The bedroom smells, the bed and the pillows are horribly uncomfortable, it's loud.
The bathroom is a bit dirty, it smells of mildew and on the shower curtain there is a lot of mildew!!
The host let you feel unwanted,he doesn't want you to use the kitchen and isn't helpful at all.
The location isn't bad for that money, but if you can afford more don't stay here."
5178,2480799,2/10/12,2163845,Cristian,"Awesome location at a very good price! 
The room is as described with all that is required for a stay in NYC. 
Shunichi was a warm host and we barely saw him during our stay. "
5178,2569600,10/10/12,1764846,Bram,"We had a great time in New York City and our stay at Large Furnished certainly contributed to that! We received keys off the building, appartment and room and could use the bathroom and even the kitchen when Shun was not in. For two persons the place was big enough and the location at the intersection off 55th street and 8th avenue was on a walking distance of times square and the subway station at 50th street... Very nice!"
5178,2627406,16/10/12,1486293,Ann,"This is the best deal in NYC!!!   The location is perfect and the room adequate and comfortable.  There is a microwave, fridge, and kettle with a variety of teas and coffee in the room so it is very self contained.  If you need additional kitchen facilities they are available when Shun is at work.  He is very quiet and I only saw him on arrival.  Shun was clear in the directions and everything worked out perfectly.  He was extremely helpful and set up a lap top computer for my use.  That was very kind and I greatly appreciated it. THANK YOU."
5178,2677389,22/10/12,1784456,Mareike,Everything was like discript. The room is very central and good to recieve by public transport. Shun answerd always very fast and was very friendly. Would go there everytime again.
5178,2847823,10/11/12,2973497,Celia,"LOCATION LOCATION AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE!

If you want a place to stay in the heart of midtown and where your privacy is well-respected, then this is the place to be!

Shun is a prompt communicator. He greeted me at the door and carried my heavy bag to my room. I didn't see him in the week I was there -  great to feel I had my own space and no curfew. 

However, any advice I needed, Shun was always willing to help.

The room itself is spacious, has a microwave, a mini fridge, eating utensils, a tv and loads of pamphlets and general info on NYC. The mattress is a little hard and unless you don't mind snuggling in with another person with close contact, then it's ideal for one person only. Sure the street is loud (being on W55th and 8th) and the window's are not double-glazed so I'd recommend buying earplugs if noise is an issue.

The only discomfort at times was the hot water taking a long time to heat up for showers - again, it's expected for an older building with old plumbing. The bathroom is shared and relatively clean.

You're given your own key to come and go when please. Everything is right at your front door from restaurants to pharmacies. Times Square not far nor is Central Park (a must see) and the subway. 

Just a head's up there's no washing machine. You'll find the laundromat on 9th ave, a block away. 

I highly recommend Shun!! Many thanks :-)

"
5178,2883420,14/11/12,1458876,Michael,"Shun's unit is a simply-furnished room with a bed, bedding, functional shelving and seating, a microwave and small refrigerator.  A large window looks out to W 55th Street from the second floor.  The picture in the listing represents it well.

Stairs lead to the second-floor unit; Shun helped with my luggage, and was kind and communicative.  (There is no elevator.)  First entry is by door buzzer; after that one has keys.  There is street noise at all times of day and night; one gets accustomed to this and to audible chaos in New York.  There is some noise abatement from closing the window and curtain.
In October, it was chilly:  a nice touch is the ceramic heater.  Cooling is accomplished by raising the window slightly.  The (shared) bathroom is just outside the unit door, and also has a permanent-on heater.  The hosts ask guests to avoid using the bathroom 7-8mam weekdays, but this can be negotiated.  

I saw the hosts only briefly on arrival.  The unit is ideally located:  near the theatre district, and four blocks south of Columbus Circle, near Lincoln Center.  There's a lovely 24-hour cale/deli around the corner on 8th avenue (Bread Box), and a sizable (and busy) Starbucks on 57th two blocks north.

I slept reasonably, given the noise outside.  If this, or bedding (hard/soft) or other details are important, these are things to discuss with any host.  I'm just learning about the features important to me.

I recommend Shun's unit to anyone who needs simple lodging in the theatre district."

Seems like your own room, because the host is gone all day to work.
Shower was hard to adjust, it was very hot or very cold. And the electric central heating was broke. There was a portable heater in the room. Goog working, but still cold with 30F outside and bad isolating windows. Bed was very good and comfortable and warm. Liked my stay, I will recommend this!"
5178,3446667,31/1/13,3407005,Andrew,It was a good trip. The flat is near Time Square. Theatres and the Central Park are nearby. Many places to eat. It was not much time to talk with Shunichi but I have good opinion about him. I'm going to stay there next time.

It was a bit difficult to adjust the water, it was too cold or too hot, but not a big deal. There was plenty of space in the room for two people. The fridge and microwave turned out to be really usefull. We will keep this in mind if going back to ny."

5178,3971286,1/4/13,3554007,Shelly,"For the price, Shun's place in midtown is a great deal.
Shun was super friendly when I arrived, and i knew he would be helpful the rest of the week, but I did not call on him again and did not see him again either. The location is very close to columbus circle and other convenient subway stops, central park, etc, so it was really easy to get around. the room is spare, but warm and has plenty of shelving etc. he provided cups and bowls, a microwave and mini fridge, so i felt i could be somewhat selfsufficient - i did use his kitchen once. The sheets and room were clean, and the bathroom was very clean as well. i didn't turn on the tv, but it was there staring at me. i would have liked to have more hangers in the closet and access to an iron if possible, but it wasn't a big deal.
Shun's airbnb room needs art. airbnb community - lets give shun some art! other than staring at the spare walls, i had a great stay.

Shun was however very friendly and we communicated when needed by sms - always very promptly. Check-in was a breeze. The neighborhood was excellent, safe with heaps of eating places within a five minute walk radius. Based from Shun's room we walked lots of NYC. The room is secure and basic but comfortable for all who spend their time out on the streets and in New York that's where you wanna be eh? Thanks Shun, we'll be back sometime!"

Highly recommended."
5178,5023069,8/6/13,5654721,Smriti,Shun was a great host - he was very prompt when replying to enquiries and he made sure the check-in process went smoothly. The location of the apartment was amazing - walking distance from both Times Square and Central Park. We had a great time here! 
5178,5375277,27/6/13,4542935,Nadja,"First of all we have to say that the hosts (Shun & Akiko) are really friendly, quiet and helpful. For staying connected Shun borrowed us his Blackberry because the airline lost our complete baggage. Thanks for that!
Unfortunately we have nothing good to say about our room. It's true that the room needs a fresh painting as stated before. The pictures in this ad must be taken years ago or are simply photoshopped because the walls are more black of dirt as white as they seem on the pictures. The whole room was unbelievable dirty and seemed not beeing cleaned properly for ages. Hairs everywhere, crumbs on the floor and a lot of dust. Honestly it was a small shock when we entered the room for the first time. Before our trip to New York we read all of the ratings here and decided us for Shun, because nearly everyone stated how clean the apartement is. We are definitely not stuffy, but this is simply not true.  The same for the bathroom. Dozens of hairs everywhere (floor,  washbasin, shower) and a lot of mold on the shower curtain, the window and the  bath tub. Honestly it was a kind of disgusting.
This was our first trip with airbnb and it was probably our last too. We have no explanation how 140+ ratings can differ from our impression so much. Nevertheless we had a great time in NYC and had to arrange with the whole situation at ""home"".

5178,5504545,3/7/13,1458876,Michael,"This was my second stay with Shun.  He's an excellent and prompt communicator.  The lodging is exactly as described, furnished with a terrific A/C, mini-refrigerator and microwave. Queen bed is comfy. Situation is perfect for a theater-goer, by walking or easy cab ride. I'm slightly mobility-disabled and Shun's unit is just one flight up. He helped me with luggage on arrival. Perfect wireless. Several reasonable eating options very close:  Bread Box on 8th and Hale/Hearty (soup,salad,sandwich) across street. Thank you, Shun!"
5178,5688823,12/7/13,4803765,Ken,"Location, location, location!  Shunichi's place has the perfect location in New York - you walk out the door to restaurants, laundreys, whatever you want - and can then walk to Central Park or the Broadway theater district with ease.  At first I thought his building was a little run-down, but the room itself had everything I needed - a small fridge, air-conditioning (it was hot!), a microwave, dishes, cutlery, a desk, storage space, and a comfortable bed.  The shower would be better with more water pressure, but this was a minor matter.  Shun himself was there waiting for me and helped with the luggage.  He's a fairly quiet, retiring sort and I didn't see him much during my stay - which made me feel like it was my own place.  A great stay - thanks, Shun!"
5178,6608967,19/8/13,1785051,Laurence,"Shunichi is a great host, very discreet, yet helpful.

the location is just perfect (hence very noisy because located in a very busy neighborhood, don't forget your earplugs!).

Contrary to some comments, I didn't find the appartment dirty, just timeworn, price-quality ratio is quite good."

Shunishi est très gentil.
Je recommande cette chambre pour vos futurs séjours à Manhattan."

We didn't find the room and the bathroom dirty. People who decide to travel with Airbnb should consider that they will stay in a private home and not in a luxury hotel!!! 
The microwave and the fridge in our bedroom have been very useful, such as the towels and the dishes. 
And last but not least, Shun is a very polite, quiet and discreet man.
We think it's almost impossibile to find another place in NYC so well-situated and comfortable at the same price!!!

The room and bathroom were clean, and the location was good. I would definitely stay at his place again. "
5178,8470698,1/11/13,9486553,Subhash,"For starters, great location. I was in NYC for only 3 days and 2 nights which meant i had to do a lot of running around and the location certainly helped. The apartment is located a couple of blocks south of central park and the subway station and a few blocks north of times square which made for great travelling times to all parts of the city. The apartment itself was nothing special. All the amenities were as described in the website except for an air conditioner, which i obviously did not need as i was visiting in winter. The room looked a bit worn down and probably needed a paint job. Some people here commented that the toilet was dirty but that was not the case. The apartment and toilet was a bit worn down but by no means dirty. Keep in mind that you are renting an apartment and not a luxury hotel. It is certainly good value for money and a great place to stay for a couple of days. Last but not the least, the host was very polite and friendly and i didn't get to see him much except while checking in and checking out. So, my honest assessment and recommendation is this- If you are looking for luxury and great comfort, then go to a luxury hotel. But if you want value for money, great location and a new yorker feeling stay at shunichi's, you'll not regret it!!"
5178,8620543,9/11/13,4508112,Paul,"Great location, perfect sized room, friendly host & environment in general. The location near corner of 55th St & 8th ave is perfect. Short walk to subway, central park, times sq, plenty of places to eat, etc etc etc. Just perfect really. Anyone who hasn't been to Manhattan the place is easy to get around to all tourist attractions via the subway. $31 for a 7-day MetroCard with unlimited train & bus use.  Shunichi met me at check in & showed my the unit & all important things. We didn't see each other much at all for my whole 8-day stay. I will book with Shunichi again / every visit to NYC.

5178,9078190,5/12/13,4892465,Ben,The photo gives a better image of the room than what it is. The room is small and can be cramped.  It is a good incentive to be out sightseeing all day and only using it for sleeping in. The bed was uncomfortable though.  But you cannot beat the location! The room is located four doors from the Soup Man and a 10 min walk to Times Square and 5 min walk to Central Park. Meals are best had outside the room at any of the many nearby diners and restaurants. Great breakfast at Cosmic Diner.  The shared bathroom was not a problem and the water was hot. Consider this if you want location and are prepared to put up with basics.
5178,9124985,9/12/13,683217,Kelly,"If u are fine with older spaces with character, this space will be fine for you.  I loved that I had a completely separate room with my own keys and the bathroom was in the hall between my rom and his living room ets areas so I felt very comfortable. I was not there more than 6 hours each day and never saw him after he let me in.  It was worth the cost savings.  Just be aware this IS NOT A HOTEL   Bring a towel.  I had to buy one.  It was very close to everything.  Just a couple short blocks and 2 blocks from subway.  I would stay again. "

Shun was very welcoming, honest and reliable, the room was warm (this was winter time) and the bed was comfy. The place could do with a lick of paint and some artwork, but for the price we'd highly recommend Shun's apartment. Thanks Shun, and best wishes! "

Ce qu'il faut savoir, c'est que l'hôte est juste venu avec une petite bombe insecticide-ridicule- et qu'il n'a pas répondu quand je lui ai demande quand il allait traiter la chambre! Pire il savait pertinemment qu'il y en avait car il nous a montré l'inutile protége matelas...
Bref je n'ai pas de conseil à donner, mais c'est important à savoir!
Le ménage est correct mais il y a de la poussière sur meuble salle de bain collée par la condensation. Les photos ont été prises il y a très longtemps car même la hotte de la cuisine a une couche de gras et moisi. 
La chambre est correcte mais ménage pas fait à fond. Chambre grande, dommage qu'elle soit spartiate car c'est un beau volume. Mais ça suffit pour un séjour à New York.

Sinon les points positifs qu'il faut reconnaître, un hôte très accommodant, flexible et qui nous garde les bagages jusqu'au départ. Situation idéale et quartier très sûr.

A notre arrivée, nous avons croisé un couple qui venait de séjourner 2 nuits et qui nous a prévenu que la chambre (et l'appartement) n'étaient pas très propres. et nous pouvons le confirmer: la peinture de la chambre est écaillée et pas nette  le micro-onde et le frigo n'avaient pas été nettoyés, il y avait une tache sur la plaque tournante du micro-onde, nous ne l'avons donc pas utilisé..., la salle de bains n'était pas nette non plus et les joints de la baignoire étaient moisis, le plafond et les murs abimés. les 2 photos sur votre site ne correspondent donc plus à l'état actuel de la chambre, je pense que le ménage n'avait pas été fait à notre (Website hidden by Airbnb) a été fait très rapidement et pas à fond le 1er jour . il y a donc une détérioration depuis quelques mois voire deux années..
les points positifs sont la situation idéale près de central park et de broadway, et la discrétion et le calme de l'hote qui rentrait tard du travail; nous pouvions utiliser la salle de bains autant que nous voulions."
5178,12649702,7/5/14,9736455,Maria,"My first experience with Airbnb in this apartment in Manhattan turned out to be a nightmare. As the host had told us, he or she (we never got to know their gender) would not be at the apt when we arrived. Instead, we were given the keys and some info on the location of the room and the shared bathroom, by a friend of the host. Although the apt was not as shown in the pictures, but a little dirtier and with the walls really bad painted, we did not care. The building is very old and the rugs look disgusting, but we did not care either.... until we spent the first 2 nights and we realised we were not alone. The room was heavily infested with bed bugs.  Out of the 4 nights payed, we could not sleep for 2 whole nights, I had to get medications for rashes that developed from the bites and I had our clothes and baggage sterilized because these bugs travel with you once you get them.

Other issues with the apartment:

The headless photo mounted on the page for the apartment also prevented any easy identification of the person owning or managing it.

The photos advertising the apartment did not correspond to the apartment.

I would strongly advise you not to rent this apartment, specially if you suffer from any allergies or if you wish to sleep. 
The worst part of the story, the bugs feed on blood and we had killed one and the stain stayed in the wall. When we came back from one of our tours, the stain was not there any more, which may mean that the host cleaned it and, hence, that he or she knew that the room was full of bed bugs.

I spent a lot of money on medications and lotions to get the rashes out of my whole body (even my face). Be safe, don't go there. Pictures of the bites available upon request!"
5178,12742051,10/5/14,12330938,Kalee,"I highly recommend staying with Shun. It's a great centralized location.  Easy walking distance to subway, central Park,  time square and many more amazing attractions NYC has to offer. 
We unfortunately never met Shun but it was a nice stay.  We will definitely stay here again."
5178,13498701,29/5/14,2851943,Véronique,"This was my second time at Schunichi's and like the previous guests I got bitten
by bed bugs. Now my fear is to have brought them back with me in my apartment.
The location of the apartment is awesome but the room is not as nice as pictured.

お部屋はきれいで、電子レンジや冷蔵庫も部屋の中にあるので、簡単な食事はできます。バストイレを挟んで、ホストとゲストの部屋があるので、プライベートスペースはちゃんと確保されています。
ホストのシュウイチさんやご友人(到着時はホスト不在のため、ご友人に家の説明を受けました)もとても親切で好感を持てました。
この立地条件でこの料金はマンハッタンの中では断トツ安くて良心的だと思います。日本人ホストなので、英語が苦手な方にもおススメです。

He gave us two keys, sheets and towels and it was a good place to stay if you don't want to pay too much money but live in a busy, central location.
It was a good and busy neighborhood and we got towels."

小生の予約期間直前に宿泊予定していた、客が、Bed Bugが心配云々と
正式にAirbnbにコンタクトをとったのが、今回小生が大迷惑を受けた原因、小生のみならず、苦情を申し立てた客も予約を取り消されたようです。
Airbnbのルームシェアリングなるビジネスモデルは、同社と物件持ち主とのやり取りは全てネットで行われ、一切対面(Face to Face)のやり取り、今回の例では、害虫駆除後の現場チェックや物件持ち主との話し合いは全く無く、全てネット、例外的に電話で行われたと推測しています。
小生のケースでは、最も弱い立場が、小生の様なゲスト、次に物件オーナーの順番になるのではと、、、。
葛西さんの物件は、ほとんど書き込みにあるように立地条件抜群、部屋・家具などは清潔に保たれていると思います。エアコンと冷蔵庫のパワーが

5178,17608071,15/8/14,10433924,Patrick,"The Condo was conviniently located in midtown Manhattan,  so many sights like Times Square are in walking distance. In the room there is a toaster and a refrigerator so you can have breakfast there. A kitchen is also available, however we did not use it. Check-in and Check-in was fast and easy. Only thing is that there was a strange smell in the room and in the condo.  Overall a reasonable price for midtown Manhattan."

Enfin pour ce qui est du quartier, c'est parfait. Nous avons tout à côté (métro, Moma, central park, Times square...). Je recommande cette chambre pour découvrir New York."

They understand needs of the budget conscious traveller!! Shunichi arranged for his friend to meet me as my arrival time was delayed, much appreciated. Would stay there again for sure. Great first airbnb experience for me."
5178,19602080,15/9/14,9333463,Anton,"The location is great! Really! 2 blocks away from subway E line, so you can to this place from JFK airport quiet fast.  3 block from central park, really nice! The room is big enough, and there is a fridge in the room which was really important. I had no problems with communication. Yeah, the furniture is not new, but for this price is a great deal in NYC!"

5178,21666587,21/10/14,2753690,Renee,"Great experience! The room was just as pictured, and had a tea kettle, silverware and dishware so it was self contained, didn't even have to go into the kitchen, although you could if you wanted to. The host's friend let me in and was very nice to help me with my heavy luggage. Shunichi was barely home, and when he was, he was super quiet."

Tout est un peu vieillot. 

L’organisation de l’arrivée et de la sortie s’est bien passée.

je recommande à ceux qui ont le budget de faire un effort pour trouver mieux, surtout si vous êtes en couple.

Apartment is located brilliantly: right next to Broadway theater district, 10 minutes away from Rockefeller center and 5 minutes to the nearest subway (either Columbus circle or 7th Avenue). Highly recommended for anyone willing to explore Manhattan on a budget. Again, many thanks for our great stay and happy New Year!"

There were fresh towels we could use, we had a fridge, a microwave, a kettle and even tea and noodles. The location couldn't be better, you can get around easily. Its a 5 minute walk to Central Park, Timessquare or Rockefeller Center. You can even walk to the Empire State Building if you want, it is about 25 minutes, but there is a subway station right across the street as well. We can totally recommend Shunichis place and would stay there again!"
5178,25454772,16/1/15,7737637,Caroline,"- The host was not available and sent a friend to meet us at our designated arrival time (thumbs up).
- The location is great as it's close to everything (thumbs up).
- The room is large as advertised (good).
- The heating in the room wasn't working so we had a small electric heater in its place. I felt it wasn't adequate given it was about -10C outside. It was cold and I had to bundle up just to sleep and also wear 2 layers of socks to walk around the room (thumbs down). It would have been nice to know this ahead of time so I had the option to consider other places.
- As there was just one bathroom, there was a note on the door about bathroom usage and when would be blackout periods - this also would have been nice to know in advance (thumbs down).
- I didn't really stay long enough to interact with the owner of the place but I did make an effort to at least say hello.
- Overall the place looks a bit run down and obviously needs work.

BUT

the TV didnt work; it was way to cold, its hardly possible to sleep; the bed was not like at the picture, it was much worse; the host didnt answer me when i had a problem finding the appartment; the room was not that clean, neither was the bathroom"

5178,27093754,25/2/15,13233765,Bob,"I had a good stay at Shunichi's. The location was perfect right in the theatre district.
His girlfriend let me into the apartment and basically just let me know which key was which. However the rules of the house were clearly printed on the inside of the door so I had no further questions. I only spoke to Shunichi once to let him know at what time I was checking out. For the rest, I didn't see or hear them.

The apartment is basic and somewhat run down. Although clean, tidy and reasonably equipped. It's a bit too prosaic for a romantic get-away :)
The central location makes up for this.

My only real problem was with the plastic cover over the mattress. There was a fitted sheet over this but still... not very pleasant. Although the bed itself was fine.

A la fin de la 1eme semaine, il nous a cependant proposé des draps et du linge propre.

We felt really nice, it’s like a hotel room :). You don't see anyone around and the bathroom was always available. 
We’ve walked most of the time, the place is in a safe area and close to most major things to visit and see.

There's no elevators so make sure your bags aren't to hefty to carry up.  As a former New York resident, the room looked like the average apartment, although I have to admit that the pictures made the room looked cleaner and new.  I love that they were towels on the shelves, hair spray, and a microwave included.  Our stay was brief (8:30pm to 4am) as we were on a flight layover. We left our luggages and mostly roamed the city the majority of the night.  There's a small couch. The location was perfect as it is in midtown steps away from Columbus Circle.  Safe neighborhood. Great find! Worth the money."

Sono andato in vacanza in una bella citta' con tanto amore insieme a mia moglie ma poi mi sono ritrovato a soggiornare in una camera che non avrei mai immaginato che fosse cosi' ...muri neri spennellato di bianco finestra rotta dove passa l'aria e forse in inverno non sarebbe il massimo , frigorifero e microonde sporchi di nero, letto  quello di una vecchia prigione , parquet nero, piastrelle rotte. Forse per la camera puo' bastare , praticamente le foto che vedete dell'host risalgono a quando praticamente si e' costruito questo appartamento .Il bagno non ne parliamo il bordo vasco e' di uno spessore di 3 cm nero, e c'era una spugna che era in uno stato di putrefazione! Praticamente potevo beccare qualche malattia.Comunque non voglio allungarmi scrivendo quello che ho trascorso in 5 notti in quella orrenda casa , vi dico solo di stare lontano da questa casa e non accettate nemmeno se il prezzo e' bassissimo perche' la vostra vacanza sara' rovinata!!! Mi dispiace che non posso mettere le foto di quella casa ORRIBILE senno' non c'era bisogno nemmeno di scrivere , attenzione che io ho scritto questo ma in realta' e' molto peggio e dico cosi' perche' non ci potete credere se non vivendo l'esperienza che ho fatto io!!   colgo l'occasione per ringraziare i membri di airbnb che sono stati eccezionali!

We had to wait for over half an hour around the corner in a local restaurant....this is not something we wanted to after many hours of flying. It also seemed this happened to the couple staying after us but for a considerably longer time. Aside from that nothing bad to say.

5178,38251006,14/7/15,22142589,Ine,Shunishi has been a wonderful and discreet host. He offered to come outside even though we got there quite late and carried our luggage upstairs. Before we left he agreed for us to leave the same luggage in his living room so we could explore more of the city. We loved the experience and stay there again any time
5178,38988520,20/7/15,9016403,Rob,"Shunichi's place was perfect for exploring New York. We didn't see him much as he was working and we were so busy, but whenever we did meet he was kind and helpful. The place is about ten minutes walk to times square and this makes it so much easier, rarely having to get the subway anywhere. Great place to stay in New York for a couple of days."
5178,40592978,1/8/15,34519956,Matheus,"The room is quite big and comfortable. The only problem is that it was summer and the air conditioning wasn't really working so it was very hot and the tv didn't work. Other than that there was no problem. He was very nice about check in and out times, because I had a flight to catch after the checkout time and he let me keep the bags in the apartment so that was cool. The stay in Shunichi's place was good overall."
5178,41111698,4/8/15,37242189,ChenLing,這是間位於上城區的房間，地理位置非常的棒，無論是前往中央公園或是往下到時代廣場，都是可以走路就到。房間內部也非常舒適，真的是值得推薦的好房間。
5178,41269884,5/8/15,6154791,David,"Our apartment building in Philadelphia caught fire, and much of our possessions were ruined and the whole building rendered uninhabitable by water damage the day before I had planned to stay with Shunichi.  So I feel asleep within an hour after arriving at his apartment and didn't wake up until the next morning.  Which goes to show that the room faces a quiet street and that the bed is comfortable, even if a metal frame.  The room is as it looks in the photo, with the additions of a table cloth, cups, mugs and a small mirror, without the plant, stool and dark full length curtain, now replaced by a shorter one that lets the light through it.  Shunichi was very communicative about my move in and had no problem with me coming earlier than I initially indicated,nor with me leaving my luggage at his place until I left the city the following day.  Then I crashed out.  "
5178,41722922,9/8/15,27305346,Martina,"Non abbiamo mai avuto modo di incontrare il nostro host,non perché avessimo degli orari totalmente discordanti ma perché non si è mai palesato. Detto ciò è stato molto disponibile nei nostri confronti, abbiamo potuto lasciare le valigie presso il suo appartamento il giorno della partenza, abbiamo trovato lenzuola e asciugamani puliti, doppio mazzo di chiavi di casa, e al nostro arrivo ci aspettava una sua amica ad accoglierci. La casa e in una posizione centralissima, vicino a central park e Times square e alle fermate della metro, per cui ci è stato facile muovevi con comodità. È una casa che vale quello che paghi, cioè poco, ricorda molto la trasmissione televisiva ""sepolti in casa""! È ideale se usata esclusivamente per pochi giorni e per passarci la notte. Le foto sul sito airbnb molto probabilmente sono parecchio datate! "
5178,43348041,19/8/15,23610538,Laisa,"La nostra esperienza qui non è stata delle migliori ma devo dire che per quello che cercavamo noi ovvero un posto comodo e solo x dormire e lavarci ,era l ideale ,anche se le condizioni e l igiene non erano il massimo.
la posizione della casa a 2 passi da central park e a poche street da Times square , e il prezzo sicuramente basso rispetto a ciò che puoi trovare a New York sono sicuramente carte a favore di questo appartamento , ma per quanto appunto riguarda la pulizia non ci siamo :la stanza si presentava decente , a parte le tinture alla parete che non avevano un senso e la stanza risultava pitturata a metà , il caldo invivibile che non ci faceva dormire perché nonostante ci fosse una sottospecie di condizionatore questo girava l aria ma non rinfrescava la stanza , vi erano anche posate e microonde ma sinceramente non ci sono mai serviti quindi non li ho nemmeno guardati .
Il bagno si presentava alquanto sporco ,  la vasca aveva le tendine ai lati sporche di capelli e muffa e il lavandino e per terra c erano sempre capelli che non venivano mai raccolti . 
Noi purtroppo abbiamo avuto anche una brutta esperienza perché durante una delle notti che abbiamo trascorso qui , un coinquilino di 2 piani più sopra ha lasciato l acqua aperta di notte quindi questa è filtrata sugli appartamenti sottostanti nonché sulla nostra  stanza e oltre ad aver passato tutta la notte svegli per paura che le infiltrazioni facessero crollare il soffitto , l' indomani abbiamo dovuto dormire con una puzza tremenda da marcio perché i tubi dell acqua avevano lasciato sul soffitto un alone puzzolente oltre che delle crepe preoccupanti .
Se dovessi suggerirlo non lo farei , suggerirei piuttosto al padrone di casa di avere un po più di igiene e pulizia nella stanza che condivide dato che è un peccato data la posizione di questa"
5178,44513120,27/8/15,25269094,Chris,"We stayed at Shunichi's place for a whole week. We enjoyed our stay a lot! We did not see Shunichi a lot, since he has quite a reserved/private personality.

Let's start with the real good things; first is location, location and location. Perfect for the ultimate new york trip! We visited all the highlights; far locations like statue of liberty and yankee stadium by subway. All other things we did walking or by hoponhopoff bus. Also the flexibility of Shunichi is great; we had all the things we needed; a fridge, microwave, shower always available at our times, etc.

When reading the comments we noticed some comments about the pictures and cleanness. Well those are true; the room is maybe not as nice or clean as shown on the pictures, but what do you aspect for this rate? If you want a perfect room book a 4 star hotel for triple the price. This room is perfect for budget minded travellers (like us). The only times we were in the room was for sleeping.

We'd certainly recommend this location for those looking for this type of stay.

5178,45492787,3/9/15,21298786,Craig And Kimberly,"Shunichi met us at the door, we arrived late and appreciated that he did not mind a late check in. Communications were good, having the back up of his friend available to check us in for before he arrived home was very nice. The room is basic, spacious by NYC standards, and clean. The perfect place to rest in a great location for our agenda. The bathroom sharing was fine and no issues. We had a very pleasant stay and were happy to be able to come and go as we pleased late in the evening. "

Close to a couple of subway station and close to the Park. Not luxurious but a basic place to put your head down for the night.  "
5178,48587516,27/9/15,43642245,Elliott,Shunichi's place worked out great for us. We found it very clean and spacious enough. It's central location also worked great for seeing everything we needed to in the city. I would definitely stay there again.

Incredible!  On the last day, I was reading the check-out instructions and saw that he wanted me to take out the garbage.  After 5 nights, I had 2 little bags and a pizza box.  Yikes, I felt badly, but didn't know where to put it and I had to leave around 4 a.m.  Hopefully not a problem.  I slept well and felt safe."

Our friend let us stay with them for the night which was a little more convenient so we didn't stay over Shunichi's place as expected."
5178,52314840,28/10/15,40726600,Michael,"Clean, comfortable, and affordable.  We were able to easily walk to see a Broadway show and Central Park.  The subway was very close and easy to maneuver through the city.  Excellent choice. "
5178,52394962,29/10/15,34572383,Linda,"Shunichi had organised a friend let us in. She explained everything to us with no problems. 
We actually didn't meet him at all as it seems out schedules didn't match up (we were only in for one night)
The room was great as it was big enough for us to repack our bags before our long journey home. 
It was also clean and easy to get to being close to time square and central park. Would definitely reccomend to anyone."

We would stay again with Shunichi! "

We were welcome by a girl but after that we have never seen the owner so you have practically the house all for you (your room and the bathroom; we never used the kitchen). The room is just what you need as you probably will be always outside and use it just to sleep. "
5178,55710099,5/12/15,32140620,Alexander,"Die Lage der Wohnung ist phantstisch! Central Park, 5th ave, Times Square, Empire States Building etc. sind innerhalb von 5 - 15min zu Fuß zu erreichen. Das Essensangebot in der Umgebung ist reichhaltig. Direkt gegenüber ist eine Parkgarage - interessant für Mietwagennehmer.
Die Wohnung selbst riecht sauber, die Böden, die Toiette und das Waschbecken waren stets picobello.
Die Wohnung befindet sich allerdings in einem stark renovierungsbedürftigen Zustand. Dies betrifft vor allem das Bad mit starkem Schimmelbefall rund um die schlecht funktionierende Dusche, sowie das desolate Gästezimmer. Die Wände sind rissig und fleckig. Die Sauberkeit rund um Mikrowelle und Kühlschrank laden nicht zur Essenszubereitung ein. Die Möbel haben ihre besten Zeiten längst hinter sich. Die Kopfkissen riechen wie das Basecap eines Teenagers. Bettenbezüge waren wahrscheinlich gewaschen, trotzdem voller Flecken. Wir haben uns eigene Kopfkissen und neue Bettwäsche gekauft. Fazit: wem der Zustand der Wohnung egal ist, und kein Problem mit Schimmel im Bad hat, sollte sich sein eigenes Bettzeug mitbringen und die tolle Lage der Wohnung genießen! Shunichi scheint ein ordentlicher Typ zu sein, obwohl wir Ihn nicht persönlich angetroffen hatten. Er war zwar ab und zu anwesend, scheint aber nicht am Kontakt mit seinen Gästen interessiert zu sein. Abolut O.K. für uns! Seine Katze ist jedenfalls supersüß und sehr viel kontaktfreudiger ;-)"
5178,56178557,10/12/15,30565244,Xin,"We loved the host's helpfulness and location, but not so much the lack of cleanliness in our room and the bathroom. The picture on Airbnb is quite misleading in this aspect. Though there were many amenities (fridge, TV, heater etc) in the room, they were all overed with thick layers of dust. The whole place smelled musty. The shelves were grimy, we had to wipe them down ourselves. There was also lots of hair strands on the duvet, but thankfully no bugs. There is also no lift, so if you have large luggage, it's quite a hassle up the stairs.

If the actual room had matched the clean looking Airbnb photo, we would not have taken issue. I hope that the host will either maintain a better upkeep of the room and bathroom for future guests."
5178,57110749,22/12/15,12393587,Nicci,"Shunichi war ein sehr freundlicher Host, aber die Wohnung war nicht wirklich einladend. Im Bad war sehr starker Schimmelbefall und unter sauber versteht man auch etwas anderes. Auch die Dusche war nicht wirklich zufriedenstellend , da die Temperatureinstellung nicht richtig funktionierte.Das Zimmer war auch nicht wirklich besser. Es befindet sich in einem stark renovierungsbedürftigen Zustand. Flecken an der Decke, dreckige Wände und auch auch der Bereich, wo der Kühlschrank und die Mikrowelle stehen, ist sehr keimig. Leider hatten wir im frisch bezogenem Bett ( wir hoffen es zumindest ) sowie auf den Überdecken lange dunkle Haare. Shunichi war aber so freundlich und hat die Decken dann ausgetauscht. Auch unter dem Bett waren Ansammlungen von Haaren :-/
Die Lage der Wohnung ist aber perfekt.
Wem Schimmel und Unsauberkeit nichts ausmacht, kann hier günstig unterkommen."

It was near everything in Manhattan (especially time square and hell's kitchen). 
It was perfect for our short trip. "
5178,57437014,26/12/15,11808135,Ritisha,"I stayed here with 2 of my friends for 2 days. The booking was for 2 people, but we had a last min change of plan and Shunichi was nice enough to accommodate 3 of us. 

The place, however, was not at all like the description/photos. It was an ok neighborhood, the stairs to the place were extremely dusty and smelly. The room was also very dusty and old. They also have a cat which was not mentioned. I am prone to allergies, and ended up having a running nose during the trip. Both me and my friend had sore throats by the end of it. 

We didn't use the kitchen at all, but it didn't seem very inviting either. The bathroom was just ok. I would probably not book that place again. "
5178,58257109,2/1/16,26716678,Shermeen,Clean and large room. The location of the apt was superb! Really convenient if you want to catch Broadway shows. There are also lots of good food in the area. Shunichi was a very accommodating and polite host.

The only issue I had with the listing was that the room was dusty and smelly.
Also the room has a separate blower heater(not central heating), that needs to be kept on at all times in current weather conditions. 
"
5178,60256899,21/1/16,46275994,Ramon,"The location is definitely fantastic and is the reason we choose to stay here. They are very quiet so you feel almost like they're not there.
Unfortunately, everything else (whilst as described) is pretty ordinary.
There was no one to meet us despite advising previously of our arrival time to JFK. We had to wait in the freezing cold for around 45mins and then when his friend got there to let us in, we had to wait while they prepared the room. They didn't change the top two blankets which was a bit gross. There was also a general unclean smell throughout.
The internet is slow (when it's working) and the shower is truly awful - you either get third degree burns or pneumonia.
It's a shame because the setup is pretty good, and the place could be brilliant with a bit of TLC - but then it would definitely cost a lot more.
In general, location is unbeatable but the accommodation itself isn't great.

Das Bett ist bequem und ich habe - trotz der Straßengeräusche - gut geschlafen. Die zentrale Lage in fußläufiger Entfernung von Central Park und Time Square ist ein toller Startpunkt für die Erkundung von Manhattan. Ich würde wieder kommen.

The room and bathroom were very clean.  Although our schedules never coincided for us to meet, everything was just as expected and even more considerations, like extra bathroom necessities in our room if we had forgotten anything, tea and a hot water kettle, etc.  I will definitely consider staying again and will recommend to others."

But the neighborhood was very comfortable and the location of the room is convenient. I think that this is a good room for summer (because heating is not working very much) and if you want a room in Manhattan near some of the best attractions and at good price

Sentralt beliggende i midtown, og nær Central Park og Subway. 
Jeg trivdes veldig bra! 
Internettet kan være raskere, især om man vil sitte på skrivebordet å jobbe er nettet veldig treigt! 

Ellers enn det, var dette et perfekt sted å bo for meg da jeg skulle hit for å jobbe og søke inspirasjon.

5178,66029594,19/3/16,50764440,Fran,"El cuarto bien, practicamente no estas en la casa. Shunichi  no se siente, es como estar solo en el departamento. Lo mejor es la ubicacion y la calefaccion, lo peor la limpieza, hay bastante polvo. 
El baño un poco deteriorado pero se puede usar a la perfeccion, la cocina no la usamos. 
La zona es buenisima, con varios lugares para ir a comer y varias lineas de subte. Nosotros eramos dos y estabamos bien, si sos uno te sobra. El placard es enorme y la cama comoda. 
El WIFI no anda a la perfección pero te podes comunicar. 
Las cerraduras de la entrada del edificio son un desastre, muy difícil  abrir la puerta, mas que nada la segunda. 
Recomiendo esta habitacion dependiendo lo que busques, si es lujo aqui no lo vas a encontrar. 
Pero si vas a conocer NY y no estas nunca en la habitacion, solo para dormir, mas que recomendado. 

The fourth well, almost not at home. Shunichi not feel, it's like being alone in the apartment. The best is the location and heating, cleaning worst, there is enough dust.
Bathroom a bit run down but can be used perfectly, the kitchen did not use it.
The area is lovely, with several places to go to eat and several subway lines. We were two and we were well, if you're one spare. The closet is huge and comfortable bed.
The WIFI does not go perfectly, but you can you communicate.
The locks on the building entrance are a mess, very difficult to open the door, but nothing the second.
I recommend this room depending how you look, if you fancy here you will not find.
But if you go to NY and never know you are in the room, only to sleep, more than recommende

Das Zimmer und Bad entsprachen den Fotos und waren sauber und gut ausgestattet.

Wir würden jederzeit wieder dieses Zimmer mieten."
5178,68947144,8/4/16,46796849,Alberto,"Partiamo dall'aspetto principale che rende la valutazione di questo appartamento positiva: la zona era semplicemente perfetta! In meno di 5 minuti a piedi si arriva a Central Park o a due differenti fermate della metro.
Per il resto l'appartamento è piccolo, spesso odora di chiuso e, non si può definire sporco, ma quanto meno poco curato e anche poco accogliente. Tutto sommato però se si usa solo ed esclusivamente come base per andare a dormire vale affidarsi al prezzo e alla convenienza della zona.
Per quanto riguarda Shunichi, è molto disponibile anche se molto riservato, per avere una conversazione con lui è necessario andare a bussare alla sua porta (ognuno valuti se sia un elemento positivo o meno!), ma per ogni problema è disponibile.
Le regole della casa, in conclusione, permetterebbero l'utilizzo della cucina in qualsiasi motivo lui non sia in casa. Noi siamo stati una settimana intera e lo abbiamo sempre trovato in casa, per cui se la vostra idea è quella di avere la possibilità di cucinare non vi consiglio questo appartamento. In caso contrario un po' alla buona, ma la posizione è ottima!"

The location is amazing, unbeatable for the price. The room has everything you need.

We would definitely stay again."

El cuarto es justo para dos personas,  hay una heladera, microondas,  pava electrica, tv y vajilla. La cama es doble, y se nos entregaron sabanas y toallas.
Shunichi es tranquilo y servicial. 
Si buscas lujo, no es el lugar, si solo vas para tener un lugar donde dejar las cosas, salir todo el día y volver a dormir, la relacion costo beneficio, es positiva.

5178,75437756,21/5/16,42530339,Nadia Melina,"El anfitrión estuvo presente en el departamento todas las noches, pero en ningún momento tuvo contacto con nosotros, no se presentó y no nos dió la bienvenida, lo que fue bastante raro e incómodo. Fue una convivencia tranquila. 
A partir del cuarto día de nuestra estadía, el wifi dejó de funcionar y estuvimos sin internet hasta el último día. 
Las fotos publicadas no coinciden con el estado real de la habitación y departamento. El departamento se encuentra muy sucio, con acumulación de cosas en los espacios comunes, está desordenado y muy deteriorado, con mobiliarios rotos en la habitación, enchufes con los cables saliendo para afuera, el piso sucio y todo rayado, las ventanas sucias, la cajonera también rota. No es un lugar habitable, no volvería bajo ninguna circunstancia. De hecho las fotos publicadas al momento de mi reserva eran otras, las de ahora se ven mucho peor y la realidad es aún peor. El baño sucio, el agua de la ducha fue imposible de graduar, o fría o hirviendo, y mala presión de agua. La cocina nada que ver con la foto, muy sucia, con cantidad de cosas acumuladas, tierra y olor. Muy desagradable en general. El departamento está abandonado, sucio, desordenado, deteriorado. A pesar de pasar todo el día afuera y de la buena ubicación, no se justifica reservar este departamento para dormir, es imposible bañarse, usar el baño cómodo y dormir tranquilo debido al desorden y la suciedad, es muy incómodo dormir ahí, con un acolchado muy sucio y que no dan ganas de usar ni de tocar.
Aclaro que yo reservé el hospedaje porque leí muchos comentarios buenos, pero leyendo los comentarios de los últimos tiempos empezaron a aparecer comentarios negativos y ahora el mio. Lamento haber reservado, esos comentarios positivos no tuvieron nada que ver con mi experiencia.
La ubicación fue lo UNICO bueno del hospedaje, y no justifica su reserva. Aclaro que me he hospedado en hostels y lugares muy básicos y sencillos, pero cómodos, acogedores y limpios, no se necesita mucho pero si lo básico, y acá no lo encontré.
Lamento ser dura, pero prefiero contar mi experiencia sinceramente y que otros puedan evitarse malas experiencias. 
Y si me preguntan por qué me quede, es obvio, porque salir a buscar hospedaje era imposible por los costos elevados que se manejan en Manhattan."

We had an amazing time in NYC and the room fit our needs perfectly. The bed was comfortable, and it was easy to feel at home and relaxed in the room. Both the room and the bathroom had plenty of space, and was nice and clean.

The location in Manhattan was very central and close to many things, while still being relatively calm at night. We also found that there was an abundance of good restaurants literally right around the corner, which was a great luxury. The most difficult thing was to chose just one place to eat at after a long day of sightseeing!  

I would reccommend booking this room to anyone who wants to go to NYC, it definitely contributed to making our NYC experience amazing!"

The room is nice and tidy.
Great place to stay in New York!"
5178,83364013,2/7/16,40546622,Samantha,There was a bit of a mishap with arrival but other than that the stay was perfect. It was close to everything and if you wanted to catch the subway it was only a few blocks away. The area and room were very secure and the air conditioning was amazing in the summer heat. Shunichi was very friendly and ready to help should I need it. Enjoyed my stay a lot and would definitely stay again :)
5178,84488860,7/7/16,46023317,Francisco,"My stay at this apartment was not the best experience, but if what you care about the most is a great location, then this is the place for you. The picture is a good reference of what to expect, although simply add an unpleasant layer of grime to everything and you have a more accurate idea. My main issue was that the room, while tidy, felt unclean and the bathroom was unpleasantly dirty, to say the least. The apartment looks really worn and it is right next to the trash room, so opening the door you smell the trash and it can be pretty disgusting. However, the inside of the apartment smelled fine. I appreciated that the room is independent of the owner's space, as a door separates the room and the bathroom from the living room and the owner's room. It was also very convenient that the room came with a fridge, microwave, toaster, and even plates and cutlery. It is pleasantly large and the bed was more of a full-sized futon. The a/c worked, but not very well, which is not an inconvenience unless one comes in the summertime like I did. Our host provided us with a room key, so it was nice to be able to lock the room and feel my stuff would not be disturbed. I didn't really see much of the owner, as a friend of his welcomed me when I arrived, and I believe that if I hadn't proceeded to ask him a few questions the one day I saw him at the apartment, we might never have talked, as he always left before I did and arrived apparently after. However, the main thing about this apartment is the location. Incredible location! It is walking distance from  Columbus Circle and all the theater area and Times Square, which made it very convenient when I got out of a play late at night. There are also a number of grocery stores nearby, including an organic whole foods style one. There are nearby subway stations and tons of restaurants, so it is easy to find anything one might need within a few blocks."
5178,86350734,16/7/16,78804951,John,Perfect location for the show I was seeing- thanks to the host for offering this.
5178,86591242,17/7/16,48344389,Arianna,"The person (host's friend) that was supposed to let us in the apartment at the schedule time wasn't there, so we had to wait almost an hour, until the previous guest open the door for us. That person was still in the room, sheets all messy, dirty towels on the bed...nasty view. The host was already on his way to receive us due to the fact that his friend never showed up. He apologized and was quick to ""prepare the room"". Honestly, the fact that we had to wait wasn't that big of a deal, hiccups happen. But the fact that after he prepare the room, it continued to look messy and dirty was kind of disappointing. To all of you looking to stay in NYC, be aware of Pros and Cons of this listing! Pros: location is excellent! Good neighborhood, very close to Central Park by Columbus Circle, lots of nice restaurants and shops nearby. This is what this listing is about. Also, he provided with maps, hairdryer, sun screen, scissors and that kind of essentials. There was a small working fridge, instant coffee, microwave and TV, which I don't know if they worked, never used them.  Cons: On the other hand, the room and bathroom were really dirty, mostly the bathroom. Guys, I had to grab a cleaning brush and a bottle of cleaning product that was next to the toilet to clean the bathtub floor, because I didn't dare to put my feet there, considering on how the rest of the bathroom looked. The sheets looked clean, but we didn't dare to use the towels, we just used small ones that we packed just in case. The cover on the small sofa was also pretty nasty. Honestly, this is not a place to stay more than one night, and that's why we decided to stay after seeing all this. If it would had been more that one night, we would have gone to our friend's house in New Jersey, which it'd had ruined all our plans. Bottom line: If you don't mind staying relatively cheap in the middle of the city, in a dirty place, this the listing to do so. At least neighborhood is safe. Otherwise, go to a different place, you got to be a care-free person to stay in a place like this, and have seen many dirty places to assimilate this. I come from a dirty 3rd world country, so there's that. But never expected this in an Air bnb listing, mind you, is my first experience :( Good luck to you all! 
P.S: The $15 cleaning fee are not being used towards that, I guarantee it!"
5178,86764854,17/7/16,17721404,Na,Everything was great! Perfect location! So close to Central Park & Broadway. Also super flexible with leaving our luggage for the day! Good value accommodation. Thanks! 
5178,88248927,23/7/16,49553075,Joasha,"Flat very well situated, easy access by subway. The street is quite noisy. The room is nice, well furnished and we were very well received. Thank you!"
5178,89925046,30/7/16,46645494,Flor,"My whole experience at Shunichi's place was perfect! Check in was easy. I just let him know about what time I was expected to arrive and he arranged a friend to let me in and provide me the keys. You can't beat the location. It's only a few blocks away from the Columbus Circle subway station, which is right next to Central Park. One block south is an NYPD station, so the neighborhood is fairly safe. Around the corner is Mariella's Pizza, which I highly recommend. There are several 24 hour stores in the area for your convenience. The room is very spacious and is perfect for one person, but it can accommodate two people comfortably. The mini fridge was very useful and the air conditioner worked adequately, especially during summer.  The bathroom was clean and functional and towels were provided. I stayed here for a whole week and actually saw Shunichi only one time and waved hello, so I had my privacy the entire time of my stay. I really enjoyed my stay here. In fact, if I ever do return to NYC, this is the first place I'll check to find a place to stay."

O quarto é bom, o host te deixa bem à vontade, como se de fato estivesse só. Não tive nada a reclamar, me senti em casa. Chegamos e o local estava limpo e no quarto tinha alguns eletrodomésticos que com certeza auxiliaram na estadia. O único ponto negativo vai para o ar-condicionado, pois acho que estava sem manutenção, gelava bem, porém estava muito empoeirado, o que me deixou com uma alergia "

El anfitrión se amoldó a nuestra hora de llegada sin problemas."
5178,96818157,24/8/16,22356371,Anne,Nous avons été bien reçu mais notre hôte était peu présent et on a un peu galéré avec la douche et la télé qui ne captait pas. L'appartement est très bien situé mais un peu vétuste. Y a moyen de trouver mieux pour ce prix je pense.
5178,98600519,31/8/16,19696784,Lau,"I will divide the evaluation, so you have a better point of view. And I would also like to explain that I traveled with my boyfriend, and were all day out walking, so we didn't need to stay in the room during the day.

Pros: location is great, in the middle of the city. Shunichi is almost always out or inside his space, so you won't feel controlled. The bed was as announced and host offers a few more things as scissors, shampoos, some cuttlery, things that may come in handy. 

Cons: room is tidy, but is quite dark (curtains could be washed too). Air conditioner works, but makes a lot of noise during the night (and you'll need it in hot summer). Bathroom is clean as far as you can see, but if you glance a little further, you'll notice some dirty spots. My towel was a bit dirty also, I had to use my bf's. Apt is on first floor (consider that if you carry heavy luggage). What seems to be living room is stacked with boxes and things -I understand is his place after all, but it may shock you when you enter. And kitchen is definitely a no to use it.

However, Shunichi is very respectful and shy, so he won't mess around you but will help you get the best out your stay. Would return, if I make a similar trip."

Nous n'avons pas croisé l'hôte durant notre séjour. L'appartement est vieux et loin d'être luxueux, mais l'endroit est propre et très bien situé dans Manhattan. Vous ne trouverez pas d'hôtel aussi si bien situé pour un prix aussi bas!"

This room is large and spacious and was perfect for a single traveler. It's a perfect location in Manhattan, close to everything you need. There's a small dorm refrigerator and microwave, toaster and hot pot in the room - much more than I expected. It's not a full kitchen but it was plenty. 
The bathroom is shared between the two rooms. Everything was great. "

The location was great, and check-in was convenient with his friend. My train arrived late to Penn Station, and his friend still met me despite the delay. I was able to leave my luggage until mid-afternoon on the day of check-out, which eased my travel around the the city. I did not use the fridge, microwave, toaster, nor A/C, and I did not enter the kitchen. As mentioned in the description, it can be noisy at night. I would also echo others' sentiments that the cleanliness could be improved."

Casi nunca vimos al anfitrión y cuando lo vimos fue muy amable, las imágenes de la habitación son reales,  buena calefacción. Estuvo todo muy bien, podría mejorar la limpieza del baño, pero estaba apto. "

It was extremely appreciated that we were able to drop off our bags early (the morning of our check in) and pick up our bags in the evening (the evening of our check out)! A good place to stay if you're looking for flexible times and the basics."
5178,115782894,26/11/16,4162253,Shermine,"Shunichi's place is in a great location and affordably priced. It is difficult to find such value in New York. While we did not interact much with him, he was helpful when we had questions. He also allowed us to leave our luggages there after check-out. If you are mostly out of the room and only back at night for rest, this room is definitely more than sufficient!"

5178,126059728,8/1/17,53538599,Cynth,"Mon amie et moi-même avons profité de l'appartement de Suchini durant 15 jours (du 26/12/16 au 08/01/17). J'ai beaucoup hésité pour la note entre 3 et 4 mais finalement j'ai tranché sur un 3 et je m'explique tout de suite. Tout d'abord parlons des points positifs : - l'appartement a une situation idéale, à 5 min de Central Park, à 10 minutes de Time Square. Le top ! On était à proximité de tout : de boutiques souvenirs, de restaurants, de fast-foods, de Columbus Circle où on peut faire ses courses facilement, bref parfait ! - la chambre est vraiment spacieuse (avec mon amie on s'est vraiment étalé, et oui on est des filles :p, mais on était vraiment à l’aise) et des équipements à dispo un frigo, un micro-onde, de la vaisselle, une TV (un peu sensible avec l'antenne), un Wi-Fi un peu capricieux parfois avec notre ordinateur, quelques nécessaires de toilette, des plans de NY à dispo... - la cuisine est à dispo et à tout ce qu'il faut pour se cuisiner des repas rapides (cela change des fast-foods à gogo :)) - la salle de bain est spacieuse également. Pas de petite salle de bain toute riquiqui, non il y a de la place dans la douche, pour se préparer, pour utiliser le lavabo… Mais malheureusement il y a quand même quelques points négatifs à retenir et pas des moindres comme : - la propreté en général. Nous ne sommes pas regardantes avec mon amie sur 2-3 poils qui pourraient se trouver dans une douche ou un grain de poussière dans l'appartement. Mais là c'était vraiment très limite, sans parler de la vétusté de l'appart, la salle de bain était vraiment borderline avec des poils, des cheveux, de la poussière par terre, le lavabo n'était pas nettoyé, je doute que le tapis soit lavé par exemple aussi. Et dans la cuisine, la plaque de gaz était grasse, noire de saleté... Dans la chambre, on aurait apprécié des draps propres entre ces deux semaines, le sol n’était pas vraiment propre, et le frigo n’était pas nettoyé. Bref nous étions vraiment déçues par rapport à cela. Et je reprécise que pourtant nous ne sommes pas difficiles en règle générale. - la salle de bain. En plus d'être très vieille (des barres de douche rouillées, des murs moisis, une vieille plomberie), prendre une douche était vraiment un calvaire. Une fois brûlante et une fois glacée, on arrivait à régler l'eau une fois sur 10. Et autant dire que c'est frustrant de pas pouvoir prendre une douche correcte quand on a marché toute la journée et qu'on est crevé. Enfin dernier point, plutôt mitigé - la communication avec l’hôte. Alors certes l’hôte est très discret et pour des gens comme moi qui préfère cela aux personnes envahissantes, c’était parfait. Néanmoins mon amie a regretté le fait de ne pas avoir parfois des infos, des recommandations (nous nous ne sommes même pas souhaités la bonne année, c’est quand même dommage quand deux..."

Une salle de bain avec une hygiène déplorable ! Je pensais que certaines personnes exagéraient dans les commentaires avant que je réserve, mais La j'ai des photos à l appui pour montrer la saleté inacceptable pour Airbnb ! Est ce que cette salle de bain est lavée un jour dans le mois ? Des cheveux longs noirs dans la douche, le lavabo, le sol toute la semaine alors que j en retirai de Moi même tous les jours ! ( cheveux courts pour ma part ! )
Des joints oranges, marrons de saleté cumulées ! Supports papier toilettes, barre de douche, étagères tout rouillé !!! Rideaux de douche sale !
Des traces de saleté sur le bord de la baignoire ... jamais vu ca de ma vie même au camping dans des sanitaires communs ! La fenêtre jamais lavée je pense ?! 
La cuisine: plaque de cuisson pleine graisse cumulée, plan de travail avec plein de miette, de reste d' aliments séchés. Pas pu l utiliser vu l'hygiène.
Dans la chambre: fenêtre tellement sale qu'on devine limite ce qu'il y a dehors, fenêtre qui ne se ferme pas totalement. Carreau du bord de fenêtre cassé en plusieurs morceaux.
L'hôte: vu qu'une fois dans la semaine quand j'étais dans la salle de bain, il est venu me déranger pour aller aux toilettes ! Pas la patience d'attendre que je finisse de me laver les dents ! Alors que l'on attendait des fois pour aller aux toilettes car le résidant qui dort dans la cuisine, squattait la salle de bain une heure !
Le seul point positif: l'emplacement !
Le seul point négatif de mon séjour: ce logement !
Jamais vu ca sur Airbnb ou ailleurs, louer son logement à ce prix avec une hygiène aussi déplorable, cela m a gâché mes vacances et cela ne devrait pas exister, quel regret d'avoir fait ce choix et d'avoir donné de l'argent pour recevoir un tel accueil, et payer de frais de nettoyage encore en plus !!!
J'ai des photos à l'appui que je vais transmettre au service Airbnb.

Walking distance of Times Square, Central Park and if you don't mind a 45 minute walk to the Freedom Tower. Lots of really good places to eat near by. Shunichi is very private and a nice guy.

Also the room is equipped with the most necessary things and even a helpful travel guide. His flat is a great starting point for all explorations whether up- or downton, just 4 blocks south of the central park.
Only drawback is the noise of the street, but I didn't really expect anything else in such a central position.

The bed was really comfortable. We didn't meet the  host but his communication was always really quick.There was a bit of noise at night but it is the middle of Manhattan so you have to expect that.

The air conditioner was the disappointing part of it all. We got there before the sun went down and had to leave because it was just that hot in the room. No fan was available. It was hot in the city and very uncomfortable to sleep. This was my first airbnb experience.

Point positifs : l'appartement et super bien situé, à 10 min de centrale park et 15 de time square, le métro 8 min en direction de centrale park, commerçant pas loin et un petit commerçant qui fait mise à burger et café et leur expresso et bon et juste à côté à self qui voit laisse choisir vos plat à 7dollars la livre si je me trompe pas donc bien.

Point négatif :
La clé de la chambre et dur à faire rentré mais une fois trouvé la techniques c'est un peu mieux.
L'odeur dans le couloir et pas top mais mais dans la chambre ça va.
La wifi c'est horrible la réception et très mauvaise et se coupe.
La fenêtre de la chambre ne s'ouvre pas car une clim et installé c' est bien mais bon j'aurai aimé pouvoir ouvrir la fenêtre.
Dans la salle de bain il y a des poils et ça c'est pas cool, il sont par terre et parfois dans la douche mais pas énormément environ 3 ou 4 mais par terre beaucoup plus donc ça c'est pas agréable, mais pas la fin du monde pour la douche !!!!

Franchement je suis passer outre car vu le prix et l'emplacement je pense qui a pire mais l' hôte devrait faire un effort surtout qua ça prend 3 min pour enlever c'est poils, sinon l' hôte je l'ai croisé dans le couloir une fois et c'est présenté et à dit bonjour, pour l'arrivé c'est une amie qui nous a ouvert malgré le retard et ça c'est cool aussi.
C' est un bon rapport qualité prix quand même et le lit et très bien, le frigo aussi ainsi que le micro onde, une table deux verre et tasse que j'ai relever quand même la chambre et propre.
 voilà je pense ne rien avoir oublié. 
Merci quand même pour l'effort de recevoir les gens à toute heures mais faire l'effort sur les point noté."

It is close to Central Park and Times Square. It fit my needs perfectly, as I was doing very touristy things and only was in the apartment at night. Shunuchi was very accommodating. My flight was delayed and I arrived to check in 3 hours after I had planned to and he was still very kind! He even allowed me to come back a few days later and pick up one of the shopping bags that I left there! I would definitely recommend Shunichi as a host."

5178,191018860,5/9/17,52985604,Ronald,"Like most of the other reviews already written, I agree that this is in a GREAT location! I walk a lot and had no problems going to Pier 83 or the entire Central Park and Times Square. While it may not be the cleanest pla ce in the world, it certainly didn't raise any issues with me. If you want spotless living quarters, get a fancy hotel. Shunichi provided a comfortable room with a tv, DVD player(remote needs batteries), Small fridge, microwave oven, and other appliances such as a toaster, etc. There is also a closet and a shelf-system that is perfect for your clothes. Shunichi was very prompt in replying to texts when I got to town and near his residence. He helped me carry my luggage up the 1 flight of stairs and when I made an inquiry about salt, he was at my door within 2 minutes. And that was all I saw of my host the entire week. It was like I was all alone the entire week. Since I am not a Social Butterfly around strangers, it was perfect for me. Price was VERY reasonable for staying in NYC. Thank you."
5178,191451659,7/9/17,135879156,Andrii,"It was great I liked everything, thanks to Shunichi!!!"
5178,192057524,9/9/17,147802064,William,Great priced room in an awesome location!
5178,193177865,12/9/17,130949127,Victoria,Shunichi was great! He was very kind and flexible with our check in time since we were traveling from Boston on train. Our space was very tidy and clean and he was a gracious host. The apartment is within walking distance to Central Park and Times Square.
5178,197323594,25/9/17,114432993,Leo,"The location is perfect!
Just in downtown and it's super convenient to go everywhere, time square, Central Park, broadway, Hell's Kitchen,I would recommend this house if you don't like to walk too much."
5178,198783746,30/9/17,55776338,Alicia,Shunichi's place is in a great location. His friend checked me in and was very nice and made sure I had everything I needed. I would definitely stay here again if I decide to visit the area.
5178,200753695,6/10/17,51503735,영임,위치는 진짜 좋습니다
5178,202198772,10/10/17,25521923,Lau,"The room is quite large and Shunichi is very responsive. However the air condition is not very cool and the room is a bit smelly. The bed linen is not very clean there are a bit spots on it, but the bed is fine. The bathroom is okay but the sprinkler has mold on it, so as the ladder of the apartment."
5178,202500193,11/10/17,44871159,John,"The location is fantastic - two blocks from Columbus Circle at the corner of Central Park, and right next to a variety of restaurants - Cuban, Mexican, Indian, Italian, etc. The subway stop was right there also."
5178,204762021,19/10/17,10235580,Beth,"For $70/night a few blocks from Times Square....you can’t beat it. Here is what I found recently (mid October, 2017). 
Shunichi went out of his way (via text) to accommodate my late morning arrival (before he had a chance to clean from another guest who had not even left yet). I met him at his employment where he gave me keys and directions for setting my bags down in his living room. 
From Penn Station to his place, a taxi would normally cost about $10 (including tip). From Penn to his employment (opposite direction) and then to his place was about $30 total. Easy to walk the distance(s) if you do not have heavy bags to carry (I did). I would say his neighborhood is quite safe.
Basic needs are in the room. If you expect super basic you will not be disappointed, if you expect “style,” then this is not a place for you. I would say that is it clean “enough,” but I did not take a shower. 
Keys: the key to locks of both building entrance doors (2) are not well aligned. I struggled for a couple of minutes, almost called him (and I can’t really say what to do to get it to work). Key to apt. itself is fine.
Never having stayed in downtown NYC, I was interested to learn about noise. Sunichi’s place is about 6 houses in from a main drag (8th Street) and on the second floor. I was impressed with how little I heard from the outside (with the window open a couple of inches), only an occasional siren on 8th (main drag). I slept in until 8:30...sweet!
Would I stay there again? I would consider it, but I’d look around for another possibility, too."
5178,206294390,24/10/17,61302838,Holly,"Was what I expected! Basic room but everything I needed. He provided clean towels which was great, and the door to the bedroom locked making me feel extra safe when I left my things behind to go explore. Had an issue reaching him at checkin which made me nervous, especially as I was a solo traveller in the evening, but once I met him and was able to checkin I felt super comfortable!"
5178,206457285,25/10/17,18110000,Anisa,"It is 2 floor , there is not  an elevador."
5178,211649667,13/11/17,79392314,John,He was really accommodating on my early flight arrival and late departure. His place is close to a lot of restaurants which was good since I am a foodie. If you’re not there is a McDonalds/ wendys across the street. His place is like 12 min away from Times Square. The neighborhood is safe to walk around.
5178,213862811,23/11/17,63813827,Joseph,Nice and cozy. Excellent location.
5178,215580638,30/11/17,134029684,Laura,"Very central, great room for the price. Host is very private, only saw him once when we first arrived which suited us great. Easy to organise and communicate with."
5178,215958245,2/12/17,153659110,James,"This was a great place to stay and a great price for the part of Manhattan we needed to be in. Check in was very flexible, the room was well furnished, we had all we needed. Shunichi was good about being in touch with us. I highly recommend it!"
5178,216925928,6/12/17,156686218,Josefina,Excelente ubicación!  La pieza es modesta pero amplia. El departamento esta muy desordenado pero es limpio. Nunca conocimos al anfitrión  aún cuando estaba en el departamento.
5178,218535289,13/12/17,10437364,Fiona,"Shunichi's place is fairly basic, however, it is in an EXCELLENT location (near supermarkets, coffee, laundromat, subway, liquor store, and walking distance to Broadway theatres and Times Square) and is good value for money. If you aren't looking to spend too much time there, it is a terrific option. Shunichi is organised and a good communicator, and we found it very straighforward. Would stay again."
5178,219110963,16/12/17,75102998,Jailyn,"The location was awesome just a few minutes From Times Square and Central Park. The apartment is about what you would expect from a New York apartment, I totally didn’t mind it because it really feel like you are living in New York."
5178,220736303,23/12/17,67924341,Vitor Mateus,Incrivelmente bem localizado. Tem tudo o que necessita...!!!! Recomendo...!!!!
5178,225244492,5/1/18,159112567,Tessa,Shunichi was very thoughtful and helpful throughout the whole process and was accommodating with changes in my plans!
5178,232597879,5/2/18,57788581,Humberto,Great location if you want to walk around Times Square. The room is ok if you are only looking for a place to stay the night
5178,233645687,10/2/18,107412975,Dylan,Perfect location to explore NYC
5178,234890366,14/2/18,165431854,Santiago,Great location for travelling arround New York city.
5178,239165985,28/2/18,159693484,Amy,Great place with amazing location ! About 5 minutes walk to broadway shows surround with lots of supermarkets and restaurants! great host thank you so much for going above and beyond with everything during my stay! There were no hot water for one night and one morning so I recommend to check before hand.Overall experience is great! Thank you for having me ! This is a great place if you want easy get around in midtown!
5178,240645603,5/3/18,37363427,Sam,Highly recommended!
5178,242857045,13/3/18,148724552,Caroline,"O lugar perfeito para aproveitar NYC. O local possui duas estações do metrô bem próximas, além de supermercados, restaurantes e lanchonetes. Como fomos no inverno, o proprietário nos disponibilizou um aquecedor elétrico. Nos deu muita privacidade, parecia que estávamos (Website hidden by Airbnb) certeza se voltarmos ficaríamos no quarto novamente. Melhor com custo-benefício, recomendo!"
5178,247440633,28/3/18,160045621,Yuko,perfect location for sightseeing!! A deli supermarket is really close and I can get something everyday I need.
5178,249689247,2/4/18,25091122,Eleonora,"La stanza è molto spoglia e la pulizia lascia a desiderare. Che c’è di buono è che è abbastanza in centro, e per la posizione che ha è molto economica."
5178,250545834,5/4/18,179339844,Lila Anna,Host was extremely accommodating with early and late check in/out. Great location. Building and room a bit old and cluttered...reminded me of my back packing days in Europe!
5178,253971035,15/4/18,55165752,Nicole,"Zurückhalten und netter Mann. Wir waren statt den gebuchten 5 Übernachtungen nur 1 Nacht dort, da es unzumutbar dreckig war. Schimmel wohin das Auge reicht im Badezimmer, verdreckte Zimmer im allgemeinen und der Geruch war undefinierbar. Es tut mir sehr leid aber ich kann nur sagen, nie nie wieder!"
5178,257303817,25/4/18,41944389,Luz,"Desafortunadamente no pudimos conocer a Shunichi, nos hubiera gustado saber con quién estábamos compartiendo piso, el lugar no esta mal, pero en las fotos se ve mucho más iluminado y ordenado de lo que en realidad está. No tuvimos ningún problema, pero tampoco hubo nada especial que podamos comentar, lo único que destacó fue la ubicación, a pocas cuadras de central park y de times square."
5178,259258828,30/4/18,20372891,Geneva,"What a fabulous apartment! Perfect for the theatre-lover, as you are minutes walk from the best Broadway theatres. Shunichi gives you lots of privacy and the apartment is tidy and full of great touches. The listing is very straightforward, but I would argue that it’s better than the description! I recommend earplugs because there is street noise but you will get that anywhere in NYC! I will stay here again when I visit NYC."
5178,266166390,19/5/18,110055350,Maico,Excelente relación precio/ubicación. Estas a dos cuadras de Columbus Circle con todos los transportes a mano y cerca de todo y con Hell’s Kitchen a mano para comer todas las noches. Nos manejamos siempre a pie sin problemas. No pretendan limpieza o lujos pero si privacidad ya que el anfitrión prácticamente nunca estuvo presente. Ningún problema en particular y flexible con los horarios de checkin y checkout así que lugar recomendado (excepto para obsesivos con la limpieza a los cuales les sugiero pagar el doble un hotel)
5178,270037571,28/5/18,53685014,Gonzalo,"La ubicación es inmejorable, se encuentra cerca del Central Park y Time Square. Muy cómodo para moverse en subte.
El apartamento se encuentra en una calle tranquila, la habitación es para pasar la noche pero limpia y la cama es muy cómoda.
Al anfitrión lo vimos solo dos veces ya que trabaja todo el día.
Sin lugar a dudas volvería a hospedarme. Lo recomiendo 100%"
5178,271525828,1/6/18,61334816,Braden,"Location is fantastic, and Bread & Honey store around corner amongst others provides ample amenities nearby.  Street noise broke sleep first night, despite fan -- then I adjusted but, as noted, it's present.  Bed was fine and large room with closet and desk makes for a good situation.  Bathroom is the only other room you have access to, but kettle and small fridge in bedroom makes it workable.  As noted, this is basic -- think dorm-room style -- then remind yourself again about the location; neighborhood felt safe even at night.  2nd floor with lots of stairs but also high ceiling in room of this old building. Host was prompt on communication and exceptionally quiet. "
5178,273006060,4/6/18,108018206,Kirsten,"Shunichi was an accomodating, respectful and friendly host. The apartment is nice, in walking distance of Central Park, and public transport in all parts of town easily accessible. There's at least four Starbucks, a Whole Foods and several 24-h pharmacies/stores in close vicinity. If you want to see New York, this is an awesome homebase. Would definitely recommend and stay there again."
5178,276035158,12/6/18,155109016,Natalia,"As the description says, don't expect luxuries. The room is okay and the bathroom is not the best but it works if you don't expect much and are there just to sleep at night and take a shower. The host was barely visible so you don't have to worry about him being in the way. We didn't get to use the kitchen but we never asked either so we don't know if it wasn't allowed at all. Overall, the location is great. There are a couple of subways, restaurants and markets to buy breakfast nearby. Not far from Times Square and Broadway. Shunichi was great at answering all questions we had so I really recommend to stay at his place while in New York."
5178,279084296,19/6/18,19828093,Jorge,"Lo mejor la ubicación, excelente. La casa no es acogedora ni limpia, pero la habitación es amplia, esta ordenada y tiene un sofa sucio q cubrimos con una manta del avion para usarlo. Además de la ubicación, tienes absoluta privacidad, a veces no sabes si Shunichi está en casa, entras y sales sin problema. La cama esta muy bien y las sabanas estaban limpias. La ducha no estaba limpísima pero las he visto mucho peores, es aceptable ducharse ahí si piensas en lo barato del alojamiento y el sitio en el q está. Si vas a New York para estar todo el dia en la calle, y pasar el tiempo justo en el alojamiento para dormir descansar y ducharte es una opcion barata que te gustará. Yo repetiría! No es apto para príncipes y princesas pero estás en pleno Manhattan por muy poco dinero. Shunichi es agradable y muy escueto, tuvimos un problema con una llave y lo solucionó rapidamente. Todo fue correcto."
5178,280153286,22/6/18,182125003,Jimmy,"Shunichi offers a place to stay in Manhattan without the huge cost. He was very accommodating for early checking and checkouts. Granted, it could use an interior makover, but it was comfortable, quiet and close to shops, restaurants, and the Subway.  I see it already booked for the rest of the year, so I recommend you book early for next summer."
5178,285359545,3/7/18,157273986,Oscar,Wonderful location right in hells kitchen. Would definitely book with Shunichi again!

5178,301112738,3/8/18,156053444,Alena,"Das Apartment zeichnet sich für Urlauber durch seine top Lage aus. 
Jedoch sind viele andere Dinge sehr dürftig ausgefallen.
Das ‚Schlafzimmer‘ war weitestgehend in Ordnung, von einem Wohlfühlfaktor konnten wir jedoch nicht sprechen. 
Im Bad schimmelte es überall, an der Badewanne, den Duschvorhängen und der Einrichtung befanden sich Schichten von Dreck, Rost und anderen undefinierbaren Dingen, was eine Dusche zu einem eher unangenehmen Erlebnis machte. Zudem fehlte an 2 von 7 Tagen warmes Wasser und im Bad befanden sich einige gebrauchte Überreste an Rasierern, Duschgels etc. von vorherigen Gästen - auch nicht sehr lecker. 
Die ausgeschriebene Küche war extrem verdreckt, was aber eigentlich keine Rolle spielte, da der Raum, in dem sie sich befand, nicht zugänglich und somit für uns nicht nutzbar war. Wir wurden in jenem Raum kurz ‚geparkt‘, als eine ‚Freundin‘, von ihm, die uns auch in Empfang nahm, bei unserer Ankunft erst einmal unser Zimmer sauber machte.. das aber auch eher sporadisch. 
Die Klimaanlage im ‚Schlafzimmer‘ funktionierte zwar, das jedoch eher halblebig; ein kühles Zimmer hatten wir jedenfalls nicht, und das sehr zu unserem Leidwesen, da es im New Yorker Hochsommer dringend nötig gewesen wäre.
Wir mussten ihm am Anreisetag nach mehrfachem Anschreiben hinterher telefonieren, wann wir das Zimmer denn jetzt beziehen dürfen. Obwohl er jeden Abend zu Hause war kam kein einziger persönlicher Kontakt zu Stande, was wir sehr schade und auch befremdlich fanden, da wir ja Tür an Tür wohnten. Check-Out Belange klärte er dann auch lieber über die App, sprich die Gastgeberrolle wurde hier nicht wirklich wahrgenommen.
Der Preis war für diese tolle Lage unglaublich gut, alles andere jedoch hat einen nicht zum Verweilen verleiten können. Mehr als ‚geschlafen‘, unser Gepäck geparkt und geduscht haben wir dort nicht."
5178,302374092,5/8/18,151650678,Briana,It was in an amazing location for a really good price!
5178,305620124,11/8/18,51623909,Vy,"Looking for a good place to crash for a few days at Shunichi's place is a good idea. Though it was very hot and hard to sleep, Shunichi provided us with another air con and it worked well. The bathroom had some stains, grime and mold. There were old curtains but it got the job done. The bedroom was dusty and dark but the bed was a good size and the host/host's friend provided us more blankets and pillows if needed. Overall, for the price and location, it's definitely a steal. But the cleanliness can be worked on. "
5178,310472808,19/8/18,160482290,Waka,This is my first Airbnb stay and I am very satisfied. I felt safe in this location and my room was clean and spacious. I would request this Airbnb in my future trips to NYC.

Definitely a five star stay.

They are ready to help when you need it and accommodating to your needs!Have to say Maryellen's croissants are the best I have had! With its closeness to 1 line, her place is easy to get to and travel from to get to  most tourist places. and on Broadway most restaurants are really good! Would recommend her place to  others! Thanks Maryellen!"

1. Location: ideal and a great neighborhood. we already knew we liked the upper west side of manhattan and now we really got to experience it like a resident. several great markets nearby, restaurants, etc. 
2. apartment: cool old pre-war style. lots of character. lots of space and comfortable.
3. the family: a great unit! we tended to be out all day and so we didn't get to interact with the family as much as i would have liked. next time we plan on hanging out some more! :-)"
5203,56954,25/6/10,99298,Virginia,"Traveling by myself, staying with this family for 14 nights. Have been to NYC for 5 times and stayed at those dirty hotels in midtown before but I have to say this is the best experience that I've ever had. What a loving family. They always prepare sth in the morning, like croissants, coffee and Maryellen's chocolate croissants is amazing! Bed is comfy. Bathroom is right in front of my room. I got to use it a lot even though I was sharing with the kids. 4 Kids are very friendly and well behave. Abby, the 5 years old one is adorable! #1 subway is just 5 mins away and I feel safe even when I got home alone late at night. Would love to come back! If you are looking for a space to stay without paying too much and got to use a clean bathroom, here is the place for you."
5203,63196,10/7/10,14915,Mayron,"Nice family, comfortable rroom, convenient location.  I just wish I could have my own key for my stay. With a young family, I understand the issues, but it would have made sheduljng more convenient. Thoughtful of Mary Ellen to include robes and the croissants were a nice touch!"

Her kids were sweet and well behaved, and her home was everything she said it would be.  Her home was full of good energy and her building was clean and uplifting.  Great neighborhood and close to a lot.  I think anyone would feel really good there.  MaryEllen was really helpful and we will request a stay with her again when my mom comes in town."

I have been staying in NYC for research purposes and therefore needed a calm place to come back to in the evenings. And the Lehmann's totally provided such a place. It was always a pleasure to have a little chat with them over a cup of coffee in the morning and they all have been always very helpful in giving me advice for finding my way in NYC.
Above that I found the location of their appartment really comfortable (two streets to the subway station; safe area, 2 supermarkets, cafes, ATM etc right around the corner).
Thanks a lot!

I am hesitant to let people know how AWESOME it was  because I want it all to myself....but something so wonderful should be shared.  It was clean, very safe, incredibly comfortable and the hosts were SO friendly and warm.  I can't wait to stay there again!"
5203,167884,8/1/11,176018,Dorothy,"Excellent!  Mary Ellen and her family are awesome, the accommodations perfect!"
5203,170664,15/1/11,176018,Dorothy,"I have stayed with Mary Ellen multiple times.  Some have been in her single guest room and other times in her guest apartment.  No matter which room you stay in, Mary Ellen is a wonderful host, the accommodations are VERY comfortable and clean, and her children are sweet.  I am looking forward to more stays with Mary Ellen and her family."

5203,211894,29/3/11,306274,Anna,"From the very minute you enter the Lehmann`s apartment you feel an atmosphere of kindness,sincerity and comfort, which I find very touching.  Each family member (Mary Ellen, her husband, son and daughters) are always ready to assist you. The guest room in their Upper Manhattan apartment is exactly as it`s described by Mary Ellen, with a very comfy matress and cozy cotton blankets. 

Thank you very much, I enjoyed my stay and already miss you!

5203,228207,16/4/11,490231,Laura,I can only recommend staying with the Lehmann family!
5203,244515,29/4/11,112089,Katya,"Mary Ellen is such a wonderful host, and every our visit to New York is accompanied by a great place to stay with clean rooms and comfortable beds, and above all, by Mary Ellen's great hospitality.  That is why we simply love staying with her and her lovely family."
5203,259393,11/5/11,440103,Barbara,"This was my first time sharing an apartment like I did.  I found it very enjoyable and felt very safe there.  I was in New York by myself and I found everything very easily.  Maryellen was an excellent hostess and her locations was great.  I was only two blocks from the Metro line #1 which took me the whole length of New York.  I got some great information on how to get somewhere from Maryellen and her husband.  Her kids where great and very respectful, which was the greatest plus since I like children.  I would do this again."
5203,261091,12/5/11,176018,Dorothy,"Another great stay...although they are always too short.  I don't think anyone could ask for a better host than Mary Ellen.  ALWAYS, ALWAYS so hospitable and kind.  I travel to NYC for work regularly and am so thankful to have such a wonderful (i.e., clean, friendly, safe, warm)place to stay every time.  "
5203,271815,20/5/11,459434,Lynn,"
I really enjoyed my stay with the Lehmanns. The family and kids were great. Everything was clean and comfy. The location was very convenient. The homemade granola was tasty, too. Couldn't ask for better."
5203,330535,23/6/11,8337,Marianne,"My stay with the Lehmanns was a brief one; I literally just needed a bed for the night, and I cruised in late and left relatively early the next morning.  But my experience was very, very positive--much more like stopping with an old college friend you stayed in touch with over the years than a night at a conventional hotel.  Sadly, I never actually got to meet Maryellen--our paths just didn't cross--but I did meet several other members of the family, all of them funny and brainy and welcoming.  It was a hot night, and when I came back after my night at the theater the AC was on and the room was cool.  I hadn't slept on a twin in years, but the bed was very comfortable and after a day of traveling I had no trouble falling asleep right away.  And I was provided with a couple of excellent cups of coffee in the morning (my breakfast of choice).  A great deal in a very fine part of town."
5203,347689,2/7/11,607989,Dyana,Terrific place to stay in NYC. Warm and inviting. The Lehmann's are incredibly helpful and accommodating. I highly recommend staying here!
5203,375816,16/7/11,607989,Dyana,"Gracious, warm and welcoming! My mother came to NYC to help me care for my baby for the summer and stayed with the Lehmann family. It was an ideal situation for her. She was welcomed into their home with warmth and kindness though also left to to come and go as she needed to. She has already been back and will continue to stay with them when she visits! Thank you very much!"
5203,390379,23/7/11,607989,Dyana,Thank you for my mother's lovely stay! Perfect accommodation for mom's coming in from out of town!
5203,461053,20/8/11,800195,Manasvini K.,"To stay at the Lehmann family 's home was such a nice experience. They all are really cooperative, nice, funny and interested. The room is so beautiful, so you can really feel home. I am so glad to met them. "
5203,464100,21/8/11,912385,Joshua,"Staying with Mary Ellen and family was great. It was just like spending the night over a friends place. The room was clean, and the bed was really comfortable."
5203,591931,3/10/11,944140,Katie,"I had a perfect stay with the Lehmann family. They were so inviting and helpful, and the room was perfect (bathroom right across the hall), clean, quiet, private and the bed was really comfortable. The location is also great - a nice neighborhood, not far from central park and very close to a couple subway stops. If you're looking for an inviting place to stay when visiting NY on your own I would recommend staying here without hesitation. "
5203,596449,4/10/11,582867,Mélodie,"My stay at Mary Ellen's place was short but sweet ! I felt very welcomed and she was incredibly warm ! I was provided breakfast, the bed was comfortable and clean. Oh and one great thing : the subway was very close ! I highly recommend this apartment."
5203,636771,17/10/11,1151870,Colleen,This was my first experience with airbnb and I was very happy with how it worked out.  I felt awkward at first being in the Lehmann's home but they could not have been more welcoming or gracious.  The room was exactly as advertised and the location was perfect for me - so close to Columbia.  I highly recommend this room and am looking forward to staying here again.
5203,786937,15/12/11,176018,Dorothy,I can't say enough about how wonderful it is to stay with the Lehman's.  I stay with them about once a month and it is such a pleasure to have so lovely a place to stay.
5203,873268,20/1/12,896929,Ute,"Although I was arriving 3 hours later than scheduled ( plane delay) Maryellen kindly welcomed me to her lovely home, showed me the room and handed me a key. There is a very friendly door man who helped getting the suitcase from the taxi into the elevator. The bed is comfy, the robe clean and cuddely and the coffee next morning was excellent. It was a special joy to meet some of Marellen's children and see them work on school assignments or hear them play the piano.
I went on a long morning walk in Riverside Park, which is just 5 minutes by foot from the house and later used the subway station 110/Broadway (just 2 short blocks). I felt very safe in the neighborhood.
Since my plane left late the following day I was allowed to leave my suitcase for later pick-up. I would gladly come back and stay with Maryellen's family again on my next visit to NY.  "
5203,897488,2/2/12,1544337,Teresa,The host canceled my reservation 92 days before arrival.
5203,902215,5/2/12,1542894,Alina,"I absolutely loved staying with the Lehmanns! They were helpful, friendly and just overall fantastic people. I loved feeling like I was part of a family during my first ever trip to NYC - and especially loved all the tips they gave me about New York through the eyes of true native New Yorkers. The apartement was fantastic! Very clean and spacious. Also, as many before me mentioned - the homemade granola was incredible :) I'm happy to say that I not only had a successful first airbnb trip to New York, but also made friends with the Lehmanns while I was there. I'll see you again soon! :)"
5203,910557,9/2/12,176018,Dorothy,A wonderful place to stay!  The home-made granola is the best!
5203,1342420,24/5/12,176018,Dorothy,"Another awesome stay with the Lehman's.  Highly recommend them!  Friendly, warm and welcoming....can't imagine there is a better host out there!"
5203,1443049,9/6/12,2287472,Sue,"A perfect airbnb experience! MaryEllen and her family are kind, sweet, and friendly. The room is perfect, fairly quiet, and a small step across the hall to the bathroom which, despite four kids in the house, was available every time I had need.

The neighborhood is fun and interesting (with a hidden easter egg for Seinfeld fans. !! Don't miss it, around 113th and Broadway). The subway is a couple of short blocks away, so getting anywhere from there is quick and easy.

I'm looking forward to staying here again."
5203,1474661,13/6/12,2379285,Christopher,"MarryEllen and Mike have a wonderful family.  They opened up their home and staying there is like having a team of hosts in a warm atmosphere.  The children are hospitable, attentive and smart!  If something is needed there is always someone around to help, yet their home has the ambience of everyone quietly carrying on their business. The location is convenient for walking and public transportation and there is a wonderful fresh and healthy market just two blocks away."
5203,1515907,19/6/12,230210,Gaela,"I had a wonderful stay at Mary Ellen’s place. The family is nice, I felt welcomed and the apartment is well located in New York if you want to visit any place in Manhattan."
5203,1543683,23/6/12,2362358,Martha,"I had a great experience and really appreciated the attentiveness and friendliness of Mary Ellen and her family.  I was well taken care of and would definitely return again!
"
5203,1630450,4/7/12,2596182,Anouk,"I had a great time staying with the Lehmann family! Even though I was out in the city most of the time it was nice to have a chat in the morning (lovely home made granola by the way!). Excellent bed in a safe family apartment, close to subway and in a convenient location (very nice part of Manhattan, though less busy than crowded midtown for example). Would warmly recommend staying here."
5203,1667995,9/7/12,1325946,Christina,I really liked staying with MaryEllen and her very nice family. They were helpful and friendly but easy-going. The apartment is neat and clean and I felt very save in the neighborhood. Any location in Manhatten can be reached easily. There were a fan and air-condition in the room and the bed was indeed very comfortable. I would definitely come back!
5203,1691751,12/7/12,2384884,Shaina,"Mary Ellen is a godsend.  I got food poisoning during my stay, and she took wonderful care of me.  I can't get over what a kind hostess she is.  Believe it or not, I couldn't have been any more comfortable in my own house.  Thank you Mary Ellen!  I hope next time my stay is far less eventful for you!"
5203,2557612,9/10/12,3202418,Natasha,"I had the most wonderful time staying with the Lehman family. The room was cosy, the kids were great, and the apartment was easy to get to. I loved where I was staying in NYC and it was made possible by Mary Ellen. I was traveling on my ow be the girls Rachel and Sarah Grace were happy to converse with me whenever I was in the house. 
I really loved my stay in New York and I was made to feel kind of like part of the family and kind of like a New Yorker too. 10/10 would definitely stay there again!"
5203,2637919,16/10/12,3721864,Jie,"This was my first airbnb experience. Had a 2 nights stay and it was great! Everything's as per advertised. It was an easy, comfortable experience. I was travelling alone, so safety was the most important consideration I had. I had no problems returning to the apartment alone at night around 10+pm via subway. The subway exit was next to a 24 hours grocery store, so even at night, there are people walking around and the path was brightly lighted. The building entrance has a nice, helpful doorman in the evenings and was brightly lighted, with working elevator. The room was private and cosy. Empty apartments just feel haunted to me.. so I really liked that the apartment has a lived-in family ambience (but not noisy, I could do work on my laptop in the room without any disturbance). Rachel (one of the daughters), MaryEllen and Mike were really nice, friendly and helpful, the rest of the children were cheerful and friendly too. Rachel and Mike were very good with directions, even providing detailed instructions with hand-drawn maps! Room and bathroom were clean and neat. If you choose to stay at MaryEllen's place, I'll suggest to take supershuttle service for airport transfers - from JFK was about USD 25 and to LGA was about USD 20."
5203,2822653,7/11/12,3109628,Anna,"I had a great stay and Mary Ellen and her family were lovely - especially after I had to make some changes due to storm Sandy, everything worked out well in the end :)"
5203,2891736,15/11/12,79276,Yumiko,"I have just stayed her place while 5 days. I actually had been living in this aria while long before moved to back to Japan. That is why This aria was perfect for me. It is very safe and convenience like just 20 minutes to get to Times Square. There are many good places to eat. Also, there some nice night places like Jazz live house or fancy bars. The room was very comfy. And it was completely private room. I enjoyed stayed her place and the neighborhood. Due to Sandy hurricane happened in NYC, I actually had to changed so many times my schedule. She was very flexible and helpful for it. Thank you Marry Ellen! I am defiantly coming back to in future! I am strongly suggest her place for your vacation!!"
5203,3031183,5/12/12,3971266,Catherine,"What a wonderful experience!  This family is terrific.  Being from a large family myself, having the parents and children around was a real treat.  In addition of having my own room, the kitchen was available for me to use and the bathroom was pretty much mine, too.  The true surprise was listening to the children play piano each evening - they are really good!  Next time I'm in New York, I will definitely hook up with Mary Ellen and her family."
5203,3104542,17/12/12,4166070,Jessica,"NY was a little overwhelming at first and MaryEllen's apartment was exactly the place I needed to recoup. The room is cozy, the shower is hot and the neighborhood is safe. I was even able to score some delicious homemade raviolis on their pasta night! Couldn't have asked for a better host family. Thanks!"
5203,3121169,19/12/12,593077,Tracy,"MaryEllen was a fantastic host!  She was so flexible with me, and even accepted  a date that she did not list as available because it worked for my schedule.  So helpful!  Also the apartment is in a great neighborhood, 2 blocks from the subway.  Very safe area and doorman in the evenings.   The room was exactly as described, the bed and linens were very comfortable.  While I didn't have too much interaction with all of the family, the interaction I did have, they were kind and helpful and so polite!  I would absolutely stay here again!"
5203,3608641,22/2/13,2384884,Shaina,"I love staying here.  It's convenient, comfy, and I feel right at home.  The bed and sheets are perfect, the terry cloth robe is very cozy, and breakfast is delicious.  Mary Ellen and her family are wonderful!  Thanks for everything."
5203,3885802,25/3/13,4519848,Melissa,"After deciding that I was going to relocate from New Zealand to New York, I was hit with the task of finding safe, clean, and affordable accommodation in an incredibly overpriced city.  Finding MaryEllen's apartment was the best thing I could have done - the location was great, less than a 1 minute walk to a major subway line, safe, well-lit, very clean area.  MaryEllen's building also has an elevator which is such a lifesaver after all those steps you take getting around the city!  MaryEllen and her family are also so generous with their time in assisting you with advice on how to get to the places you need to be.  This was my first AirBnB experience, and it couldn't have been better!"
5203,4045281,5/4/13,1966311,Georgeta,"I enjoyed my stay. The room was as depicted in the picture. The bathroom was just across the room, no clutter, clean. Providing a fluffy white robe was  very thoughtful and added to the cozy feel. MarryEllen and her family were delightful, I only feel sorry I was so busy that I did not have more time to chitchat a lit bit more. Additionally, the location of the apartment is great, just off Broadway, close to subway and restaurants. Very safe. Perfect for anyone visiting NYC. Thanks MaryEllen. "
5203,4146349,14/4/13,3997059,Brenda,"A perfect place for this solo traveler...great west side location, a comfy room, gracious accommodating hosts...and the background bustle of their lively family.  "
5203,4431128,5/5/13,4211636,Karen,"This is perfect for someone who wants a homey, comfortable and personable place to stay. I was warmly welcomed by Mary Ellen when I arrived, and had opportunities for nice conversations with other family members during the course of my stay. I had plenty of privacy and could come and go on my own schedule - no pressure to socialize. The room was comfortable; the location is incredible: just two blocks from Central Park and between Amsterdam and Broadway, so it's close to plenty of restaurants, coffee shops and markets, as well as very close to public transportation lines. And where else could I hear piano music as I got ready for my day!"
5203,4563417,13/5/13,5088903,Lisa,"I really enjoyed my stay at Mary-Ellen's.  In fact, I felt extremely 'at home' there.  She and her family were so welcoming and I had several fun chats with their eldest daughter who was also very helpful.  My early arrival was accommodated, I was free to come and go as I pleased and the home-made granola with fruit and yoghurt at breakfast was delish.  Mary-Ellen even gave me some to go home with, along with the recipe, which I just made for the first time back in Paris.  Thanks Mary-Ellen & co!  :-)  A bientôt..."
5203,4699722,21/5/13,1130261,Aline,"This was my first time using airbnb and everything went good since booking the room and effectively staying.
MaryEllen and her family were wonderful hosts.
The room and bathroom were exactly as pictures, very confortable bed!!!
Certainly I""ll be back to the house

Hope see you soon! "

5203,5495606,2/7/13,79276,Yumiko,"The apartment was 2 subways stops nearby. It is just 20 minutes to get to TSQ. There is doorman. Beautiful the Cathedral of St. John the Divine 5 blocks away...Also my favorite place is Colombia university is also close. The campus is beautiful. Great Mexican, Cuban, Hamburger, cafe places are just close to the apartment. Safe neighborhood and nice host and cozy room. Everything was parfect!! I really want to back to their place again!! Thank you!!!"
5203,5726981,14/7/13,79276,Yumiko,I loooove Lehmann family. This place is very confirmable for me. The room is perfect size for 1 parson. It’s a perfect cozy room with High sealing. This is second time I came back to this place. The reason is very simple. I just like this family and place is comfortable and safe. I just want to say thank you for always welcoming me!!!
5203,5846616,19/7/13,5166627,Mira,MaryEllen was not home when I arrived in the middle of the day but her daughter took care of me and she was really helpful! I met MaryEllen later that day and she was really welcoming. The place was nice and clean. I would recommend this place to all and would stay there again!
5203,6051287,28/7/13,6809030,Margie,"Staying with MaryEllen and her family was fantastic! This was my first experience with Airbnb and I absolutely loved my time with them.  The room was clean and very inviting, the bed is honestly the most comfortable I have ever slept in, and even though another family came to stay in the other room during my stay, I never had to wait for the bathroom.  I felt totally comfortable coming and going as I pleased, and MaryEllen left croissants and Nutella for me for when I woke up since I like to sleep in on vacation. I loved hanging out with the family, and I got along well with all of the children-- such a sweet family! The shower was nice and tall, which was great for someone who is 6'4"" (the twin bed was a little short for me but that was my only complaint-- the footboard was low enough for me to put my feet over). The oldest daughter was very helpful when I arrived and drew me a map of the area and gave me recommendations for places to eat, and the whole family was very willing to answer the questions I had, and since I was fighting allergies, they let me have their Throat Coat tea with extra honey :) I would absolutely stay here again, any time! "
5203,9578332,2/1/14,10895107,Jen,"I stayed here for New Years Eve and it was a much better alternative to spending $$ in a hotel! The subway was only a couple blocks away and I felt very safe walking to and from the subway. The entire family was very nice and welcoming! Mary and her oldest daughter were very helpful. Her oldest daughter took me to and showed me how to navigate the metro, gave some ideas on what to do on NYE and how to get there, and put out breakfast in the morning. The house was clean and quiet, and Mary had made soup so it smelt delicious as soon as I walked in! I felt like I had a lot of privacy and slept well on the bed - and I'm a pretty picky sleeper. I would definitely stay there again!"
5203,13517176,29/5/14,15157219,Anastasia,"Over 150 good reviews-they know what they do, right?! I see why now.
I was looking for most importantly safe and convenient relatively subway place. It was a perfect match! 
I felt very home, relaxed and welcomed. I stayed in smaller room but honestly-it was totally enough space for my needs. Super comfortable bed, fan was chilling room perfectly or hot May nights (there is even optional AC if its too hot), I had closet and shelves for all my stuff, small table. Shower might  shared with another guest if someone is staying in bigger room, but it's clean and nice.
Very kind family members did leave granola breakfast and coffee every morning. They were so generous to help with advice, some medicine for my non-wellness and even made a lil card at breakfast table at my (Website hidden by Airbnb) the same time I never felt bothered and had as much privacy, rest and comfort as I needed.
Subway is literally 3 min walk; it's 15 min to midtown and 30min to downtown-it's amazingly convenient, there is no way you will be late or confused! In the area there are multiple groceries stores, places to eat. It also safe. When I move to NYC next year I will be looking for a place in same neighborhood. 
I will def recommend this place to all my friends-visitors of NYC. 

Thank you dear family!!!
"
5203,13828144,5/6/14,12845368,Angie,Had a very enjoyable time here. Felt like I was very well taken cared of. Mary Ellen and her family were very gracious hosts. The location was great - very safe and near the subway. Really appreciate the breakfast that was put out every morning too! It just made the whole experience that much more sweeter. Would definitely stay here again :)
5203,14362239,17/6/14,15884889,Crystal,"This is my first time to visit New York and i feel so lucky to stay in Mary's apartment. The location is prefect convenient where takes 5 mins to Metro as well as near by west Central Park and Columbia University. The guest room is very cozy and clean that i feel like ""at home"". Mary's family is very nice and welcome to me! Besides, Mary is a good talent for cooking and i enjoyed the breakfast time with her adorable daughters Richel and Abbey. :)  Thanks Mary again and I would like to recommend to everyone who seeks for a homey, comfortable and personable place to stay. "
5203,14446523,19/6/14,16355944,Maria,"MaryEllen was a great host, very friendly and helpful. The apartment is located in a nice area on the upper west side, just a few mintues walk from the metro or less than $20  cab ride from Time Square. 
She left a light breakfast in the kitchen for me in the morning. The bathroom is shared with the other guests, if any, otherwise it is all yours.  I will definitely recommend her for your visit to NYC. Lovely stay in a truly lovely american family.
"
5203,14745643,25/6/14,15875596,Margaret,"I am happy to report that all the information provided by Mary Ellen is completely accurate. I agree with the other positive reviews posted here. I will add that the neighborhood is very convenient and close to everything I needed (bank, buses, subway, Rite Aid, Starbucks, etc.). It is also very close to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and to the coffee shop featured on Seinfeld. I would stay here again for sure. I had no troubles whatsoever and I was very comfortable. I will miss Mary Ellen's homemade granola! Thank you, Lehman family!"
5203,14830937,27/6/14,7575663,Laura,"My stay in NYC wars certainly improved because I stayed with MaryEllen and her family. When I arrived Mary Ellen greeted me outside here door and made me feel very welcome. The room and bathroom were neat and clean, the mattress was just right. The air conditioner kept the room very comfortable and provided a noise screen too. Great neighborhood! I felt very comfortable walking by myself at night. I will definitely contact Mary Ellen for lodging my next time in NYC."
5203,16086867,22/7/14,15937647,Victoire,"I head a great stay in this cosy little room for my first trip in New York.  The appartment is perfectly well located, 3 minutes walk to the subway, I felt perfectly safe even at late hours. 3 blocks from Central Park. The room in itself is very clean and tidy, with plenty of space to fit your things in. Very clean bathroom as well, you share it with other guests if any. Breakfast ready early in the morning with some nice suprises every now and then (home-made blueberry muffins unforgettable !). Mary Ellen and her daughter provided me with useful advice and were always willing to help. I would definitely come here again."
5203,16658289,31/7/14,15598968,Claudia,"My living room was confortable and nice. The room is small but it has everything you need and the bed is fantastic! The bath you can use is right in front of the room and it is only for the host. The house is located very well, next to the subay and you can reach the main places very simply. All the family is friendly and respectful of your privacy. Thanks MaryEllen, to you and all your family! Bye! "
5203,17173532,8/8/14,18766209,Jiaxin,Mary is very nice. She gave me the big bedroom and provided delicious breakfast for me. Big thanks!
5203,19780498,18/9/14,14169079,Tiffani,"I was moved into the big double room - and it was wonderful. The apartment is conveniently located near the subway, and near shops and a Starbucks. MaryEllen and her family were very welcoming - she provided homemade granola for breakfast and even made me decaf coffee when I requested it. The bed was comfortable and the room was nice and quiet, the bathroom was very nice. The only downside is that the wifi didn't always reach to the back rooms which made it hard to facetime my family at home. Great stay over all though."
5203,20156966,24/9/14,6253876,Wendy,"My host was wonderful and my stay in this cosy family apartment, and great neighborhood, was the best!"
5203,20257961,26/9/14,568104,Henrik,Mary Ellen is an amazing host. She has a great home and a huge space for her family. The room and bathroom provided is quite spacious. She is super generous with serving  breakfast in her dining room including homemade granola (very nom nom)
5203,20514830,30/9/14,9933534,Carol,"I felt very much at home amidst the family activities.  The children were courteous, quiet, and friendly.  Mary Ellen was very hospitable and accommodating to my needs.  The location was absolutely perfect and I would stay there again. "
5203,21394944,16/10/14,4197782,Janine,"The stay with Mary Ellen and her family has been a wonderful experience. The room was very clean and the bed super comfy. My luggage didn't arrive, so Mary Ellen got my some supplies and got me some clean clothes. I appreciated that so much! Thank you again. The family was very friendly. And the cereal was delicious. I would recommend her room any time. "
5203,21580156,20/10/14,13603658,Ariane,"This was my first with Airbnb and I absolutely loved it. The location is great, very close to the metro, easy to get by and around NY. Their home is lovely and very welcoming. I highly recommend it for women travelling alone. The family was extremely respectful. The bed is super comfortable. The wifi fast and reliable (important for me because I was traveling for work).
"
5203,21782194,24/10/14,9591048,Nancy,"I couldn't have asked for a better experience staying with MaryEllen and her family for a couple of days. Her entire family made me feel welcome immediately and easily accommodated my presence into their home. The room is the way it is pictured; the bed is quite comfortable. I think MaryEllen chose a very good mattress! MaryEllen hospitable character also showed by providing tea or coffee and a very nice breakfast.  

The location is just a few blocks from Columbia University.  There are many restaurants within 2 blocks.  Great location, great accommodation, wonderful hosts.   Thank you MaryEllen and family.
"
5203,22799493,15/11/14,11376763,Elissa,"Staying at MaryEllen's place on the upper West Side exceeded my expectations: probably one of the most convenient locations in NYC, and the apartment was beautiful. I got bumped up to a large room with its own bathroom, and the bed, towels, everything I used was high quality and comforting. MaryEllen and family were terrific hosts, knowledgeable about the city and interesting to talk to. I will definitely stay there again when I return to New York. "
5203,23033917,21/11/14,568104,Henrik,"MaryEllen and her family are wonder hosts. All very friendly, warm and inviting. The apartment is a beautiful pre-war building located very close to the subway and a number of places to eat. The clean guest room is just like home and actually is a home for this nice family. The light breakfast of homemade granola cereal and coffee is a real treat. Wifi has a strong signal and is very usable. "
5203,23158252,24/11/14,22508539,Rodrigo,"What can i say about my trip with these family? Actually,one word is enough to describe them , AMAZING FAMILY ,they are friendly and good vibes! Also..the their home is so cool ,and very localized ,near the central park and stuffs..actually,it was the best host family i ever had,even it was just for 3 nights..but it was enough to know that they are the best..

ps:the breakfast is delicious! 

I hope i will stay there again soon! Kisses kisses!

Love 
Rodrigo"
5203,23992141,16/12/14,1308471,Sissi,"Wonderful stay, I had homemade granola and croissants each breakfasts and French toast my last morning! I ended in a bigger room than expected, which was very nice and my own bathroom. Warm hospitality but still having my privacy. I totally recommend staying with Mary Ellen and family! "
5203,121131896,14/12/16,143639,Emilie,"Once again a wonderful stay with Maryellen and her family

A cosy safe room just a few subway stops from the heart of the city

A warm tea always awaits you and delicious French toast or granola to begin your day seesighting

I just can't imagine going anywhere else in NY and I invite everyone to enjoy the Lehmann's hospitality"
5203,124328766,1/1/17,102874431,Natasha,MaryEllen is an amazing host. My friend and I stayed at her place for NYE. She made it feel like home. Thank you MaryEllen for all your help :) will def be staying at your place if I ever visit NYC again.  
5203,125035413,3/1/17,55275869,Sarah Anne,"I am so very grateful to have found such a cozy place to stay on my first solo trip to the big apple. Their home is almost as lovely as them! Tea, delicious sticky buns, and the coziest bed made for a fantastic stay. My only regret is not being able to stay longer! "
5203,126386267,11/1/17,12656378,Luis Guillermo,"Maryellen was a wonderful host, she went above and beyond to make my stay absolutely amazing. She responded to all my text messages. The place is very close to Mount Sinai St' Lukes if you are going to interview there. I would definitely stay again. "

5203,132851581,19/2/17,500371,Mafaz,"Mary-Ellen and her family were wonderful hosts and their apartment is absolutely charming. I stayed for three nights and immediately felt as though I had been there before because of how comfortable the place was. It was lovely to wake up to the smell of toasted croissants and coffee every morning. Mary-Ellen showed me where everything was as soon as I arrived and was extremely accommodating to my check-in and check-out times. The location is close to several subway stations and not too far from Central and Riverside Parks. There are a bunch of great coffee shops around the neighborhood as well. If you're looking for a clean, comfortable, and welcoming environment then this is definitely the place to book!"
5203,136239011,9/3/17,29543919,Asami,MaryEllen's place felt like home and was always full of delicious smells. The room is simple with a small bed and desk space that is part of a large book shelf but roomier than I expected. I was visiting Columbia so the location was perfect. Very close to restaurants and the 110th St station to catch the 1 train. I didn't get to spend much time with MaryEllen or her teenage kids but I had a lovely time chatting with her husband and hanging out with their dog during breakfast. Definitely recommended for solo travelers.
5203,136563917,11/3/17,11040763,Ashton,"The whole family is amazing, including their sweet dog.
I will suggest staying with them to anyone I know who plans a trip to NYC.

5203,137996548,18/3/17,15828157,Lydia,"Hands down my favorite Airbnb listing where I've stayed in New York. Mary Ellen is easy to communicate with, and provides a very pretty, comfy room that's in quite a nice building. I got there late and left early, but the nice desk in the room helped me get some essays written for my classes. Definitely hope to stay here again for future city visits!"

5203,141734590,4/4/17,23049434,Daqian,"Great location, 5min walk to Columbia campus; fantastic people! Clean, cozy room in a spacious apartment. Freddie is probably the cutest dog you'll ever see within a 10 mile radius. "
5203,145887644,20/4/17,29953293,Tiago,"If you're on this page and found availability for the dates you need, close the other tabs and just book it. What a fantastic experience this was all round. 

MaryEllen and her family (incluindo Fred, the dog), were fantastic, charismatic and super receptive. They give you your space (I had my own bathroom), and really make you feel at home.  

I am asthmatic and didn't have to touch my inhaler once, which is a huge deal for me. 

MaryEllen and her family were an absolute pleasure. They really were, and words really can't capture accurately how pleased I am with the experience. 

Thanks M.E and family

Tiago"
5203,151578236,13/5/17,109690458,Barbara,"I stayed one week at MaryEllen's home. She and her husband were really flexible of checking in and out. During my stay I could come and go like I want because of my own key. As I was on the way all the time, we didn't see us so often, but nevertheless we had some nice talks. Otherwise the family accepts my private sphere, so I felt really well at their home. Also the family-dog Freddy is so lovely and good-natured. 
Coffee, tee, granola and fruits were available all the time. MaryEllen also made towels and a hairdryer available for me. 
Their nice, big flat is well-located at a subway-station and you can reach Times Square in about 20 min. The Central park is in walking distance. I felt safe at their home and in the surrounding area all time. So I can really recommend MaryEllen's home specially for single travellers, because I think you could rely on their help in case of need."
5203,169455644,12/7/17,3640654,Zach,fantastic. great stay and nice people 
5203,170492373,15/7/17,130906520,Abdul,If you are a lone traveller and need a place to sleep and drop bags safely then look no further. This place is on broadway and at walking distance to subway and central park. That's all you need to discover the top attractions of Manhattan. Mary and her husband Mike are very hospitable. They made sure that guy at reception is aware of my arrival to treat me well. They welcomed me right at the elevator's door and helped me with my heavy luggage. They even kept their dog locked so that it doesn't interfere with guest. There were few things which required their assistance like shower operation. On checkout the humble Mike again helped me with the luggage and saw me off until I boarded the cab. Thanks Mike n Marry for making me feel at home.
5203,172700991,21/7/17,31191229,Jeong-A,I enjoyed Mary's flat a lot not only because of her hospitality but also because of all the family members' care. I would like to recommend this lovely stay for dog lovers and ones who wanna stay near the park and calm neighborhood with convenient public transportation. I would love to come and stay this place again for my next stay :)
5216,1701,21/4/09,10901,Luis,"I highly recomend this apartment!... Just arrived home now from NY and had a blast there. The apartment has the best location one can get. Just in the midle of everything. It's very confortable, quiet and cozy.
I'll be back for sure!"

Her superintendent wasn't to friendly thou. So if u need a central place that will give you a good nigjt sleep , her place is that place to be. "
5216,6137,26/7/09,22211,Sergio,"Great place to rest and keep your belongings safe and secure. Tonya and her family are really friendly and very responsive. We had some trouble with her internet connection, but it didn't matter since there were plenty of free wi-fi cafes all around us. The superintendent did seem a bit up tight. However, I highly recommend this apartment!!!"
5216,7618,17/8/09,25777,Nick,"The apartment was in a great area, and was super large as advertised. I had no problems with Tony or the super. I definitely recommend the place."

Tonya's place was clean, in a great location, and met all our needs and then some!  She was very courteous, responsive, and flexibile (me and my travel partner were late due to traffic, and she arranged for the property manager to meet us, even though it was 9pm).  My friend and I enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend this property and Tonya as a hostess anyday!  Thanks again Tonya!"

the apartment is basic - clean. a little different from the nice picture but gives valu for the money we payed. they can improve the cable TV channels - they currently have only very basic channels. not even the leading ones. 
the Supr - Winston is a great asset. very nice and helpfull.
"
5216,18436,27/11/09,51224,Paula,Our stay was disappointing as we did not stay in the apt advertised.  Accomodations did not reflect the images posted on the site. No explanation was given as to why we were given an apt on the 2nd floor instead of the one on the fourth floor as per the itineary. Found the space to be somewhat dangerous (non child proof)with an open loft that had no railing as was seen in the pictures. My child was disappointed to have not been able to sleep upstairs for fear of rolling down to the first level.  Th bathroom was cramped with very little space to move around and an exposed hot pipe that ran from floor to ceiling that burnt my child when she went to take a shower.  Not an ideal place to stay with kid(s).  The street view does not represent the actual street (W 25th) where the apt was located.
5216,196728,11/3/11,293312,Chris,"Nice apartment for two people to stay in NYC, maybe a little small for two couples. The lofted bedroom is quite short, but overall an extremely convenient apartment and convenient stay (super lives in the building so key hand-off, etc was easy)."
5216,261267,12/5/11,2425,Crisel,"Our stay at Super Large APT was amazing! We booked the room one day in advance of our stay which can be a little nerve wrecking, but Tonya was great at responding. The check in was very easy and upon enterting the apt I found it to be quite charming - perfect for two people. There's a balcony which we didnt really use, but a 'nice to have' in case you want to chill in between sightseeing! The bed was comfy and I loved the decor. There were extra sheets/towels and even a hair dryer which was great since I forgot mine! The couch was also very comfy - again, perfect for two people. The location itself was great - easy access to diff neighborhoods. At the end of each day I was very happy to head back and would def stay here again. I didnt get to meet Tonya personally, but she sounds great and was an accomodating host! The checkout was also super easy. If you're looking for a nice place to call home away from home, stay here!"

The apartment was not very clean, no chair to seat, no table to eat comfortably, the main bed was not so good and we got also some trouble with the bathroom, but Tonya and Wilson were very nice and helpful.
I was only to old to stay there!!"

5216,2210610,5/9/12,3234406,Jared,"We were very pleased with our stay at Tonyas. The location of this place is perfect, restaurants, shopping, pubs, clubs, time square, subway access, everything we wanted to experience when going to NYC, all so close. It's a cozy place that will comfortably sleep three people, more if you double up in beds. The only issue we had was with the wireless Internet, which did not work. This was a nuisance as we are from out of the country and use our Internet for much of the day planning, therefore or phone bills became very expensive."
5216,2798777,4/11/12,2642940,Melanie,"We stayed at NYC during the hurrican Sandy. Tonya gave us all the assistance we needed.

5216,3330877,12/1/13,3296714,Amanda,"My friends and I stayed in Tonya's apartment for 13 nights and had an amazing time in NYC!! This apartment was quite small but is good in accommodating up to three people. It also didn't appear to be very clean but just some maintenance here and there would really refresh its look and appeal. Tonya was a fantastic host who answered any of my concerns or questions very quickly and was very helpful during our entire stay. The LOCATION of this apartment was phenomenal - 10 mins walking distance to Times Square, subway around the corner and central to many key NYC spots. Towards the end of our time in NY the apartment really did start to feel like home and we all would come back and rent from Tonya again! "
5216,3685115,4/3/13,4202682,Meredith,"This apartment was in a great area of NYC! Don't let the street front deceive you.  Things were clean and was a good size.  It's definitely darker than the pictures and I wouldn't recommend more than 4 people since the fold out futon is not very comfortable.  Tonya did reply right away to an email when we couldn't find more toilet paper and couldn't get the sofa to fold down which was great.  

Great location, and good space. "
5216,3814965,18/3/13,421346,Christopher,"A great apartment in a great spot- my friends and I had a great time in NYC, and big thanks to Tanya for her great place!"
5216,4073266,8/4/13,3231709,Vanessa,Situated in a great location.  The apartment was definitely not spacious even though the pics make it look spacious.  The beds were comfortable.  The loft bed is smaller.  4 persons stayed.  The plumbing in the shower/bath is very slow to drain and was full of hair.  There is a plunger and a strainer there but it definitely needs attention.  The keys were available as advised.  The price was very reasonable.  You don't get the street noise which is good.
5216,4562493,13/5/13,4973391,Annia,"Situated in a great location, near subways, restaurants and make it easy to enjoy the whole city. The apt is less spacious than the pics let think, but still good value for money. A little bit dark as the window shows the back of the building, but the plus is thus that the place is really quiet for a very central NY street. Definitely for not more than 4 people, (so maybe ""Super Large"" is not exact) but enough to spend the nights. We did not met Tonya but Winston, the superintendant, was of great help. Enjoy your stay !"

Easy checkin and checkout, comfortable accommodations and great location close to subway and restaurants on 26th St, plus groceries and CVS. Very walkable to Little Italy, NYU, and lots of shopping on 5th Avenue. I really appreciated being able to book on short notice. Way better than a hotel. "

Check in was simple, and Tonya was always accessible and accommodating - so happy have been able to experience the city through Tonya's apartment and neighborhood!  I'll be back!"

The gentlemen who work in the building are professional and made us feel safe.  The apartment had everything we needed and was clean when we arrived.  The location was amazing, easy walk to multiple trains.  Everything from booking throughout the stay was professional and very easy to work with.  Owner contacted us several times throughout stay to check in. Every time we saw the gentlemen who worked here they always asked if we were ok and if we needed anything.   Great place, great people.  Highly recommend it."
5216,107820726,12/10/16,28473682,Neal,"The location is the major selling point here.  Seconds from the Flatiron building, meaning you're right in the Manhattan action.

If you aren't super fussy about the ""design"" aspect of the space, then this is your best option.  Ultimately, you're in New York.. no one spends time in their apartment and neither will you."

Cuando llegamos el apartamento estaba muy sucio, pero llamamos a Tonya y se hizo cargo de ello muy rápido,  en el mismo día llamó a una mujer de la limpieza y lo solucionó.  El barrio está bien y la localización muy buena. Buena comunicación con todo Manhattan pues hay varias paradas de metro cerca. Tonya nos hizo sentir como en casa y en general la experiencia fue buena. Sitio recomendable por la localización.  Gracias! Xx"
5216,129546765,31/1/17,33209988,Gaby,Tonya Thank you for hosting us!  it was great.
5216,271200449,31/5/18,77814223,Robert,"Tonya’s place is truly a home away from home. It’s in a great place in the city for first time visitors since it’s smack dab in the middle of Manhattan!  It’s relatively close to the subways and blocks away from some really great attractions and restaurants.  Tonya is very easy to talk to, and because she lives so close, she is always there to lend a hand or give some useful advice in a time of need. She and Winston were very helpful to us during our stay on more than one occasion.  My only small complaint is that the WiFi and signal in the apartment was a bit spotty at times which made working from home a bit of a hassle. You gotta find that sweet spot where you can connect your devices and get decent signal — aka just move closer to the window till you hit it!  Honestly though, that is such a small thing compared to what the apartment offers. I always felt secure coming home and I knew that my room and my things were always safe. For the location and the amenities (I.e. full kitchen, fire stick TV, two beds, plenty of storage, etc.) you can’t beat the price. I would definitely come stay here again and recommend it to any of my friends staying in the city."
5238,8739,1/9/09,14340,Sarah Jane,Ben was so hospitable and his apartment is very comfortable and tastefully decorated. The location is fantastic (right next to the subway) I would DEFINITELY stay there again. Highly recommended. 
5238,10941,21/9/09,38119,Helen,"The location is perfect! It is right next to subway, grocery, laundry, restaurants and close to everything in downtown NYC if you want to sight see. I would recommend it for budget conscious travelers who want their own private space. Ben is really nice guy too."

After about 2 min of explaining everything, we were on our own.  The apartment was perfect for the two of us, but could easily fit 4.  It's in a good location and had everything we needed.  I had a great experience and highly recommend the apartment and renting from Ben."
5238,93065,8/9/10,151696,Tessa,"My fiance and I stayed at Ben's place over Labor Day weekend and had a pleasant experience.  The location was good, very close to the subway, and the apartment was clean.  However, there were a couple things that we were not so happy with.  1)  The bed.  For one person, the bed may work, but for a couple the bed is not good at all because there is a giant hole in the middle of it that you kind of sink into.  2)  The air conditioner.  The air conditioner wouldn't work and we couldn't figure out for the life of us why, until my fiance decided to open it up and found 2 inches of dust in the filter which we proceeded to clean.  The place cooled down nice after that but cleaning up other people's air conditioners wasn't what we wanted to be doing.  3)  The pictures are misleading.  It looks the same, but the pictures make the apartment look a lot bigger than it is in reality.  Hope this helps!  "
5238,145447,28/11/10,212999,Ruediger,"I stayed a week at Ben's apartment. He left the apartment a short time after my arrival. He is a nice, friendly and very helpful guy, for example he gave me very exact and detailed hints, how to get to his apartment even before I arrived. He explained me the essential things in his apartment like the heater, which window could be opened best etc. After a few days, he contacted me by mail and asked, if I needed some help or recommendations. The apartment is clean, homely with enough space for one or two people. It has no exaggerated style but a charming atmosphere. The subway F-Line is right around the corner. The neighborhood is young, ethnically mixed, with many small shops. The supermarket, where you can buy with Ben's discount card, is only some minutes away. All in all worth a visit to Ben's apartment. I highly recommend Ben with his hospitality and his apartment.
Thank you, Ben!!

5238,176198,30/1/11,345338,Lily,"Ben was an incredible host, I really couldn't have asked for a more fantastic experience. His home - it really does feel like a home away from home - is perfectly tidy and clean, and bears lovely personal touches. For example, Ben added a quaint quilt to the bedding (it was freeeeeezing cold the week I was there) which he told me belonged to his grandfather. Example #2: the fridge was stocked with beers leftover from NYE which he said I was welcome to help myself to. So nice!

The apartment has good heating, TV, a coffee maker (and coffee & filters), and a really comfy bed. It's SO close to the East Broadway subway, which was really convenient. Actually, I found the location perfect, it was really easy to get across to Williamsburg and uptown. Plus there's an awesome pizza place nextdoor!

Ben let me use his local cell for my stay, which made it easy for people to contact me.

I really reeeaaaaally recommend Ben if you're making a trip to the big apple!"

5238,196512,11/3/11,366489,Michiel,"I stayed a week at Ben's appartement, it was just perfect. The place was nice, just like it is on the pictures and located on a great spot for daily trips around the town. On the corner of the street is the F-subwaystation which makes it very easy to plan your trips, and also when arriving from and leaving for the airport (in my case JFK). I had a friend over one night, and he slept on the sleeping couch, which was also no problem and in fact a good bed. Last, but not least, Ben is a wonderful host: making absolutely sure you are fine all the time. He had good tips for bars and restaurants in the neighbourhood. Also, I could use his cellphone meant to contact him for questions to make short calls to relatives in the town. Ben is an openminded, nice and just a great guy. Had a wonderful stay at your appartment Ben, was very nice meeting you!

5238,215701,3/4/11,352694,Jenny,"Ben is a great host that made me feel very welcome in his apartment. I stayed there for three weeks and it is a great base for exploring NYC. The subway station is very close and is a good line for access to Greenwich Village and Midtown. 

Ben is very laid back, friendly and flexible. He provided really detailed instructions on how to get from the airport to his apartment. He has a great knowledge of the area and gave some good recommendations of restaurants and bars in the close vicinity. 

I'd highly recommend him as a host and would have no hesitation in booking his place again."

A great little apartment with everything you need, including a subway stop that gives you access to everything. 
Ben was a great host.  He waited for us to arrive and wasn't annoyed that we arrived after 10 p.m. He showed us the place and left us lots of information and he even checked up on us to make sure everything was going well.

Ben is an awesome host, and even though we never actually met he was always on hand throughout the booking process and during our stay.

Sincerely we had the best time in the city thanks to having such a good place to rest! We strongly recommend Ben’s apartment!"
5238,499283,4/9/11,610271,Keira,"Ben's apartment was ideal for our first time in New York; its a great size for a couple to stay in, and is decked out with everything needed for a comfortable stay. Don't expect glitz and glamour but it is as described - an authentic NYC apartment. We felt safe even when walking home late at night.
It's really close to a subway stop so it's super easy to get anywhere in the city. (and there's a McDonalds downstairs - a bonus when you don't feel like using the kitchen).
Ben was a really good host - he was in constant contact leading up to our stay (we had to change our plans a little due to Hurricane Irene and this was no problem) and easy to get hold of with any questions during our time there.
Highly recommended if you're on a bit of a budget but still want to stay in Manhattan."
5238,514981,9/9/11,571595,Marie,"Appart super bien situé (au pied du métro), à la limite entre chinatown et lower est side. Ce dernier quartier regorge de bons petits restos bien moins cher quand le reste de Manhattan.
Il est petit mais bien agencé, parfait quand on est deux. Tout est là pour passer un agréables séjour. Surtout, il est très calme (appréciable à NY!). Ben, malgré son absence a tout fait pour prendre de nos nouvelles et savoir si tout allait bien. Il nous a même arrangé et s'est débrouillé pour régler des problèmes de réservation de notre part. Bref, un très bon hôte!"

We had a great time in NYC, apartment is clean, next to F train so you can litterally go anywhere very easily. Neighborhood is very quiet as well.

5238,692904,5/11/11,898668,Susanne,"First of all: Excellent communication with Ben! He also left us a cell phone to call him any time. 
The apartment is more or less right at the exit of the subway, close to a big supermarket at the East River (Manhattan bridge) close to a bicycle rental, with a bicycle lane right in front of the house and only one stop from the so called LES  (nice clubs, bars and restaurants).
The apartment has WIFI and cable-tv an all facilities to cook at home. 
Ben left us fresh towels and linen too, so we were able travel much lighter.

If you are looking for a non touristic NY- experience we can only recommend Ben's place.

Since our first contact, Ben was 200% careful and dedicated to the most simple demands. Even during his holidays he contacted us daily.

As for his place, it is cozy and could really fit our family of three. I've got no complaints, on the contrary.

And the subway by our door was a real plus: we could just go anywhere we wanted with our one-week pass.

Thank you Ben, we've already referenced you to a good friend of ours. And will do to anyone who asks us about NY.

Cheers,

The apt is just as described and the subway station is about 30 sec walking ! It is very convenient ! 
Just in case we would recommend you to bring earplugs because the walls are thin. 

One more thing, if you need a taxi at the airport please look for the real YELLOW CABS. A lot of guys from private companies are waiting for you and they will charge you a lot ! They know how to find exhausted travelers who will not pay enough attention. 

We really recommend Ben's apt it's a really good place to be in order to discover the city !

The location is great, walking distance to the Financial District, Brooklyn bridge and Little Italy, Soho, Noho, etc, and the subway on the F line is just a few steps away from the flat. Perfect to discover NYC!
We will definitively contact him again on our next trip to New York!"
5238,10492094,22/2/14,9919955,Ignacio,"Ben is an excellent host! The place works perfectly for two people and its very cozy. 
We have a great stay! 
Thanks Ben
"
5238,11322166,30/3/14,11702154,Lapo,"Ben is a very thoughtful host. From before we arrived to let us know you are worried about the price, time and means of transport to get from JFK airport to his home. It has always been helpful in giving us directions and advice on NY in general. The house is as you see in the picture, very comfortable. Also it is quiet and there are a very comfortable bed and a sofa. 
The location was great and convenient for visiting the city. The metro is 30 meters. The alternative is of course to walk and see the city street by street and area to area. We preferred this possibility, starting from home and going straight through Chinatown, Little Italy, Nolita, Washington Square, West Village and on to Central Park. It's a great walk. 
In short, a guest house and perfect. Recommended to anyone who wants to take a vacation to NY."
5238,11634593,10/4/14,148284,Jeremy,"Ben was a great host. He accommodated our check-in and check-out times, gave us lots of great information, made a bit of space for us in his closet, and was easily accessible for questions. The apartment was cozy with the typical NYC quirks, and the subway is a block away. The apartments is located on the edges of several neighborhoods, chinatown being dominant. Would recommend. "
5238,12044817,22/4/14,8798703,Steffen,"We stayed at Ben's place for a week around Easter. The appartment is quite small, but it fitted our needs very well and we had a good time. It lays in a nice neighbourhood, not much noise and close to both a subway station and some delis. We didn't spend that much time in the appartment, we were mostly in the city, so we didn't have the chance to use the kitchen very much - there wouldn't be any problem with using the kitchen though; it contains both a stove and a quite big oven. There might be a problem with eating homemade food, because the appartment doesn't have a dining table, but it shouldn't be a problem in a city like NYC, where there's delicious and cheap food practically just around the corner. We only ate breakfast at the appartment, and we used, quite creatively, some stools as little individual tables. We didn't have any problems with hot water - there were always enough for us three girls.

Ben was an incredible host. He answered all our emails very quickly, and he gave us good guidance to both the neighbourhood and appartment, the city, and the transportation to and from the airport. His help and advice had a huge part of making our trip amazing. We can only recommend his appartment!

5238,13206063,22/5/14,11318816,Christian,"Stayed at Ben´s apartment for 7 nights with my mother and my brother. Even though it is a relatively small apartment, it was no problem fitting in 3 persons. As we spend most of our day in the city, we didn't really needed more space. The place was nice and clean, and had everything we needed. The location is perfect. Brooklyn Bridge, Chinatown and Financial District is in walking distance, and if you´re going uptown, there is a subway station 2 minutes walk from the apartment.

Ben is a great host. From our very first contact he was informative and thorough. When we arrived he walk us through how everything worked, and during our stay he contacted me, making sure that we had everything we needed.

I would highly recommend this place!  "
5238,13503142,29/5/14,11365118,James,"Ben was so relaxed and helpful.  The apartment is great for a city trip and so close to the Subway you couldn't get any closer?!  You can be anywhere in minutes which is so helpful.  

It's a nice and quiet as well which is helpful when you need to get your head down (there is a launderette underneath so sometimes you hear the washing/dryer machines but they're super helpful there too and turned round some washing for me in no time at all so always a plus!)"
5238,15134225,3/7/14,1023515,Adolph,"Great host, great apartment, great location.  Ben is a courteous, friendly, very helpful and attentive host, a very nice guy.  The apartment was very clean, the bed was comfortable (mattress is new), plenty of towels and everything (TV, kitchen essentials etc) that I needed was available in the apartment.  The apartment was quiet and conventiently located on the second floor of the building.  The subway station is a half block/street away from the apartment.  The neighborhood is safe, lively and filled with restaurants, bars and cafes, a great neighborhood.

I highly recommend future guests of Airbnb booking/staying at Ben's apartment.  Thank you Ben for making my stay in NY most enjoyable and hassle free.

Best regards,
Dolph Orlando     "
5238,15559131,11/7/14,17550956,Kelsie,"Our stay at Bens was an extremely positive experience and he ensured that we had everything we needed! He was helpful with logistics and coordinating the visit - especially since our trip was a last minute booking with a late check-in hour. 

Great area and super close to the subway. Always an easy time coming back home and even found our favorite late night Chinese restaurant around the corner. :)

Overall no complaints and would use again!

5238,15832710,16/7/14,2545250,Ksu,"Ben is a wonderful host. He gave all instructions about transport, bars, cafes etc. The apartment is ideal for two guests with ideal access to subway. Near Brooklyn Bridge, Chinatown and Wall str. "
5238,15978526,19/7/14,11608354,Gary,"Ben was a great host! I had a travel/weather issue on arrival and he made every effort to accommodate my delay. Great location with easy access to subway.  The apartment was just as describe clean, safe and cozy.  It has all the comforts of home. Had a good stay, wish it was more pleasure than business.  I'll will look Ben up again on my next trip to the city."
5238,16707881,1/8/14,14190202,Florence And Kevin,"We stayed in Ben's apartment for a total of 9 nights. His apartment had all the basics we needed for our travel. It was spacious by New York standards, clean and very conveniently located near a subway.

Ben was very friendly and helpful himself. During our stay, there was a problem with the drain in the bathtub. He did all he could to fix it without imposing on our stay.

Stay here if you are looking to have an authentic NYC living experience in the Lower East Side!"
5238,19815019,19/9/14,14176944,Sara,"Ben’s apartment was a perfect location to explore the city, it’s only a few steps away from the subway entrance. The apartment was a safe place to stay and it was clean, comfortable and certainly big enough for the 2 of us. Ben is a great host, super flexible hours to check-in and he’s a quick communicator for helping with practical things. Thanks for everything Ben! This was a great first airbnb experience.

I would highly recommend this place!"
5238,20111185,23/9/14,467321,Timothy,"Ben was an accommodating and conscientious host, and the apartment was exactly what I was looking for -- spacious, clean, private, relatively quiet, steps to a subway entrance. Would love to stay here again, either on my own or with my family. Great experience."
5238,20413531,29/9/14,5962281,Grace,"Ben's place in the lower eastside was a great location for our needs.  We came into town for a wedding and Ben was able to host us at his cute apartment.  The apt is very close to all major transportation options including a metro stop, several bus lines, and taxis.  In addition to that,  we were able to locate many local places to eat in Chinatown and Little Italy! 

The apartment itself is a perfect space for 1-2 people with a cozy living room (cable included!), a surprisingly spaciously bedroom, and full bath. It is decorated with fun glimpses of his interests and film history.  The neighborhood felt very safe, we walked around at night and during the day and the people in the area are great, working class folks.  It was clean and ready for us to use when we arrived.  Whenever I contacted Ben, he was very responsive with helpful tips.  He was prompt to be there at our agreed check in and check out time.  

We have to give Ben a very special thank you, mistakenly on our part, left the spare keys in our pockets and in the whirlwind of trying to get to the airport did not give them back! He was very gracious and understanding despite the circumstance, and we were able to FedEx it back to him overnight.  

In short, Ben is a great host and a laid back guy! His prices can't be beat for Manhattan and its proximity to Brooklyn and all the surrounding areas.  "
5238,21458296,18/10/14,17133729,원우ㅇ,"we spent 6 nights at Ben's apartment, and his place was greater than we expected on the pics :) he was a nice host, and kept checking me if there's any problem even he was out of the nyc for a few days.. my first experience of airbnb was perfect! highly recommend to choose his place :D"
5238,21778524,24/10/14,11234698,Lauren,"Ben was a great host who kept in touch with us before our visit and in the first couple of days to check that everything was ok. We appreciated the email giving public transport directions for us from JFK airport. When we met Ben, he was friendly, helpful and ran through the useful information to know about the flat. 
The flat is really close to a subway stop so great for getting around. We loved that it was only one stop to Brooklyn and would recommend going over early evening to watch the lights of Manhattan turn on as dusk arrives.  The flat was comfortable for us (2 people) and it had a good strong shower to wake us up! The area was fine, no issues at all. There were always lots of people around so it felt safe.  There are lots of places to eat nearby. "
5238,22062195,29/10/14,20126599,Tommaso,"The apartment is very tiny but comfortable. Perfect for 2. The bathroom is OK, and the shower works perfectly. Subway REALLY close, just around the corner (couldn't ask better)!
Neighbourhood very quite even if really close to Chinatown. 
We just used the apartment for sleeping because we were travelling all day, so we have no complains. Ben is very kind and helpful. Really good experience!"
5238,22758171,14/11/14,2648792,Camila,"La estadía en el departamento de Ben fue como estar en nuestro departamento. Todo súper bien equipado, absolutamente todo lo que necesitamos los encontramos y todo limpio!(lo que muchas veces no encuentras en un hotel) la cama y almohadas cómodas, teníamos calefactor para los días fríos y aire acondicionado para los calurosos.
Ben se comunicó con nosotros siempre y fue muy claro en todas las instrucciones. Para llegar al lugar nos fuimos en metro desde aeropuerto JFK y fue muy rápido y fácil, nos tomó aprox. 60 minutos en total.
El departamento efectivamente está a solo pasos de una de las entradas del metro East Broadway, linea F, así que nos movimos en metro durante toda la estadía.
Fuimos varias veces a Chinatown caminando, está súper cerca, también caminamos desde ahí hasta el distrito financiero(un poquito mas lejos pero cerca igual) y el Soho(más lejos, pero se llega caminando también sin problema).
El barrio es una barrio auténtico en Nueva York, sin grandes riquezas, súper sencillo y multicultural. Justo abajo del departamento hay una lavandería que nos fue muy útil! y en la esquina hay mini markets que están abiertos hasta muy tarde y todo lo que necesitamos lo compramos ahí a la hora que fuera, muy cómodo. 
Algo muy importante!, podíamos descansar perfectamente del ruido de la ciudad porque en la noche casi no hay ruido, a excepción de un día que al parecer algún vecino hizo una fiesta pero nada grave. 
Por otra parte decir que Ben definitivamente da mucha confianza como persona y eso se agradece mucho."
5238,23520742,3/12/14,18031684,Emily,I had a great first Airbnb experience at Ben's in the lower east side. We were met at the apartment by our host (even though we got in super late) and got lots of info and tips about getting around and the local area. The apartment was well equipped and very close to the nearest subway station. Overall I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a place to stay in Manhattan. 
5238,23742745,9/12/14,20121987,Vera,Everything was great we enjoyed our stay in NY a lot. Thank you!!
5238,23841388,12/12/14,1924587,Tara,"Ben's apartment is clean and cozy. We had everything we needed for our stay of 3 nights. It is in a secure building on LES which is about as close to the subway as you can get without being right on top of it. Coffee shop and drug store nearby, which I personally find really handy. "
5238,24172190,22/12/14,8501916,Anastasia,"Ben's apartment was great. It was so close to the subway which made it easy to get to any sights and also to Brooklyn. The apartment was the perfect size for two people and everything we needed was there.

Key exchange was also easy, though we probably put Ben out a bit when we didn't return the key properly (sorry Ben!).

I would recommend the apartment to anyone. The LES is fun and vibrant and Ben's apartment was everything we needed for our time in NYC."
5238,24701735,2/1/15,16446335,Mery,"Ben was a great host and was always available. I had some trouble with my flight and he waited for me.

The apartment is cute and cozy as described, it's functional and it location half block from the subway is just perfect! My friend and I had a great time there!"

5238,28083330,17/3/15,26013795,Florence,"Ben was a wonderful host. Before our trip, he was sure to find out which way we intended on travelling from the airport and gave us detailed yet simple to follow directions to his apartment. Upon our arrival, he made us feel very welcome, giving us all the information we needed about his place and was friendly and accommodating. The place itself is just as pictured/described. It was clean, tidy and incredibly well presented. It was the perfect amount of space for 2 people for a short-ish stay. The bed was really comfortable and the apartment was so quiet - despite being right next to chinatown - so we slept really well! The neighbourhood was great to stay in, full of places to eat and drink and a great location for transport - just seconds away from a subway station but also easy walking distance to many attractions. Ben was really great with our departure, in no way rushing us out and allowing us to leave our bags until the evening as we had a late flight. We'd absolute recommend Ben as a great host and would love to stay again!"
5238,30183673,19/4/15,5181613,Josh,Great place to stay to get the real NYC experience! On the verge of China Town and only steps to the subway! Great bars and restaurants only a walk away
5238,30668170,26/4/15,26677533,Nuria,"We stayed in Bens aparment 6 nights. The best of this apartment is its location, as you have East Broadway metro station not even one minute  walking, or you can walk quite easily wherever you go. the neighbourhood is not really nice but we did not encounter major issues. The apartment is small but for 1-2 persons is really fine. The blankets and towels were clean and the bed was comfortable. The shower was not working properly as the water stuck there, which is not really comfy when showering.
The apartment looks quite old but in case you are looking to stay for a short period, Bens apartment is ok."
5238,31161324,3/5/15,25194746,Emmanuel,"Ben is a very nice and kind host!
My mother and I stayed at his place for one week and spent a terrific time in in New York.
Ben welcomed us personally, explaining to us everything we needed to know about the apartment. Since he was not in town during our stay he made sure we had all the information we needed in advance. Communication was also very easy, as he responded to our e-mails almost immediately when an issue came up. He provided us with detailed directions to his place and with his apartment being just a few footsteps away from the next subway station, it was not hard to find at all.
The apartment itself was simple but cosy.  Everything we needed was provided. Our bedroom was not facing the street but a courtyard so it was mostly quiet (except during our first night when lots of helicopter traffic was going on).
I can definetely recommend Ben´s place. It's not super fancy but if you're looking for something comfy and perfectly located  this is the place to go for. Great spot to explore NYC from.
Thank you Ben!

The flat is cosy and clean as shown in the picture. The appartment is very closed to the subway which is so great after a long touristic day.

I strongly recommend the flat. Thank you again Ben for the very nice stay

5238,34845349,13/6/15,19945176,Audrey,"Nous sommes
Trois amies, nous avons passé six nuits dans l appartement de Ben début juin. 
L'appartement est très bien placé car le métro est au bout de la rue, situé à la limite de chinatown. Le voisinage est calme, la chambre ne donne pas sur la rue. Il y a la climatisation.
Ben est très sympa , accueillant. Il nous a donné des conseils et à même pris le temps de nous commander un taxi pour repartir à l aéroport. 
L'appartement est idéal pour trois personnes (trois couchages séparés).
Nous avions tout ce qu'il fallait à disposition dans l appartement (draps, serviettes de toilette, torchons). 
Bref nous vous recommandons cet appartement si vous souhaiter dormir la nuit loin de l agitation de Times square !  "
5238,35199470,16/6/15,5774068,Dann,"Ben's place was great.  It was clean and surprisingly quiet. We were late getting in (almost two hours) and Ben was patient and understanding. 

The only thing I'd say to others is that Ben's apartment is not super close to most of the main tourist attractions.  That worked out for us as I usually stay uptown and wanted to get to know a different area.  There is a lot to do near his place (I especially recommend the tenement museum) but you've got to work a little harder at finding those points of interest. 

I'd happily stay at Ben's place again."
5238,35775983,22/6/15,16423859,Françoise,"Ben a été un hôte très accueillant, accommodant et discret.Son appartement est conforme à sa présentation, un peu flatteuse. Il est bien situé à 2 pas de Chinatown, et Little Italy et parfaitement desservi par les transports (métro à 50m et bus à la porte). Il est bien équipé et décoré mais sans chichi et nous nous y sommes sentis comme chez nous. Nous le recommandons sans réserve."
5238,36392807,28/6/15,32274765,Andy,"Three of us stayed at Ben's for four nights and the apartment was ideal. The location is perfect, a short walk from the Subway station and bike rental. It was comfortable for three people despite being fairly small, and is well decorated and has all the amenities you'd expect. Ben had no problem meeting us late at night for check in and early in the morning to leave, and was friendly and professional. We would happily stay here again or recommend it. "

He waited for us upon arrival (even though we were late), and went through everything we needed to know clearly. He also made an effort to check up on us, which was greatly appreciated. The apartment is small but cozy and definitely has everything one would need for a stay in NYC. It is literally 30 seconds from the F train subway station, which is EXTREMELY convenient after long days out and about! "
5238,39513602,24/7/15,14551608,Liz,"Ben's place worked out great for us. He keeps it clean and provides all the amenities you need. As other reviewers mentioned, it was close to the F metro station which makes it very convenient. There are also lots of places nearby to get your morning coffee.

Appartement très bien situé, proche de nombreux lieux touristiques, métro au pied de l'immeuble. L'appartement est petit mais il y a tout ce dont vous avez besoin, et même plus!

The apartment is exactly as show on pictures. It is clean and especially perfect for two people seeking a place to stay in Manhattan. The Metro is really close to the apartment.

We had a wonderful time and would recommend this place to others."
5238,41736392,9/8/15,7470545,Kris,"Just back from our short stay in NYC at Ben's apartment, which was more than fine for 2 nights. We appreciated Ben's flexibility with the arrival and departure times and he takes care to make sure you have all the information you need for the apartment and the nearby area. The place is small but that's typical for NYC apartments. The three of us did just fine - even had the choice of sleeping on the really long sofa in the bedroom or a ""real"" bed in the living room. We opted for the sofa and it was comfortable. Being so close to the East Broadway subway was a huge plus - it's literally steps away - and we were able to find a cab to get to airport without going too far. The shop owners in the near vicinity were nice - it was convenient being able to grab a deli sandwich late at night. Ben does a good job describing the area, which is what it is - as long as you don't come expecting the ambiance of Greenwich village or the Upper East Side, you'll be fine.  In the end, my friends appreciated seeing a ""real"" part of the City and we felt perfectly safe. Ben was good at communicating through the whole reservation process and gave us a nice welcome when we arrived. Thanks for a great stay!"
5238,43212121,18/8/15,27735088,Benoit,"We enjoyed a lot our stay in Ben's appartment. His place is quiet and clean. Ben helped us before and during our stay. He answered very fast to our questions regarding our schedule. It is also well located, very close to the East Broadway station. We recommend his place an we will probably come back one day there. Thanks for all. "
5238,45240236,1/9/15,4413583,Paul,"Ben is a very welcoming individual who eagerly assisted us during our stay, even though he had to depart to Oklahoma during our stay.  We had a number of contacts in case of emergency; however, we did not need to bother his friends as everything ran smoothly. Ben is an extremely interesting individual, and we wished we could have gotten to know him better - maybe next time.
The place itself is well located to downtown, China Town, Little Italy, Soho and Brooklyn.  Even though we enjoyed walking around, the F Subway is on the corner - so no part of the city is too far.  The neighbourhood itself has a real community feel to it.  It has a mixed ethnic make-up, which gives it an interesting feel.  All in all, a quite enjoyable experience.  "
5238,47616971,21/9/15,31006668,Sarah,"We enjoyed our 3 night staying in Ben's apartment - a great base for a short stay in NYC. Description is accurate - the apartment is small but well equipped. We loved the location and not having a typical 'tourists' experience of NYC.

Although we didn't meet him, Ben was a great host - ensuring we could get into the apartment, knew how everything worked and had contacts for any issues. 

Our only other feedback would be that the apartment wasn't that clean and the photos make the place look a little less cluttered than is actually is  - not a major issue but worth being aware of.

5238,48374105,26/9/15,5041211,Chris,"We had a very good stay in the apartment for our 4 days in NYC. The apartment is located close to the subway so we had an easy time getting anywhere. Although Ben was out of town, he was very organized and had a friend meet us. All went very well. "
5238,48877407,29/9/15,38562883,Jackson,"A nice and cozy apt, with the subway only a half-block away. Chinatown and Little Italy are a short walk away. The perfect place if you're looking for something in the Lower East Side that comfortably houses two, is reasonably priced and isn't a hotel.

As my wife put it, ""I want to stay in an apt and not a hotel to experience the Manhattan way of life"". This apt is perfect for that. While it has a kitchen and a dining table ideal for two, my wife and I spent most of our time seeing the sights and eating out.

Ben was awesome. He was always available to answer questions via the AirBnB app and was very courteous, with a light sense of humor. His background in theater is apparent in the apt, with theater and movie-related decorations that were great conversation pieces. 

Won't hesitate to look this apt up again on our next visit to NY!"
5238,49585467,5/10/15,6989616,Nikki & Kim,"We had a great time in New York, and enjoyed the apartment of Ben especially because of the great location! The apartment looks the same as on the photos. 

Check in went easily, the neighbour of Ben (Anna) gave us the keys and let us in the apartment. Although we contact through (Hidden by Airbnb) as well with Ben. There is a guide in the apartment available with all the information you need about contact, how things work in the apartment, transportation etc. That was really helpful. 

Regarding to cleanliness, the bathtub was not very clean. We couldn't take a shower after each other directly because the water didn't drain immediately. Also the fridge was stuffed with food and drinks of previous guests. With is not really a problem, but some products were out of date, so a bit smelly. 
There were plenty of clean towels and linens available, in the bathroom closet.

Altogether, we had a good stay! Thank you Ben :)

We had a late check in (because of a delay in airport) but his friend was waiting for us. Although Ben was not in town, he checked to be sure that we have no problem and gave us a contact (just in case) but really we had no need.  
All went very smooth. Thank you Ben, see you next time!"

5238,73509619,8/5/16,25805845,Kazia,I stayed for three nights with my son and husband and Ben's place was perfect for our needs. He was very kind and accommodating and responsive to my many questions about restaurants and the area in general. He has amazing suggestions so take note! The area is interesting and rich with history. The apartment was clean and cozy. It is easily accessible to anywhere you want to go. Next time we are in NYC we will stay at Ben's.
5238,76113074,24/5/16,28886781,Andrea,Me and My partner had an amazing time in the flat. It is close to everything a lot of bar and restaurant around the area. We had the best time . Ben was amazing with info and directions.

Great location, clean, and an affordable price. Ben was an amazing host and went above and beyond to give great directions for exactly how to get to his place from Newark Airport. Highly recommend. "
5238,83150064,1/7/16,25994740,Courtney,"Ben made us feel incredibly welcome during our time in NYC and changed his plans to meet us in person when our flight into New York ran late. The apartment is very funky and Ben clearly takes a lot of pride in making it look and feel unique and comfortable. Location in the lower east side near East Broadway subway and walking distance to downtown was ideal for us, as was the nearby laundromat and deli. Overall we had a fantastic experience staying with Ben and would highly recommend his apartment to anyone visiting NYC!"
5238,84709260,8/7/16,6921168,Timon & Sarah,We had a good stay at Ben's appartment. Everything was like in the descriptions. Very close to the subway. Ben organized everything well so we could find his appartment and the keys very easily. 
5238,86772411,17/7/16,3439095,Timothy,Fantastic little apt in an interesting part of NY I hadn't visited before. Ben was very helpful and accommodating with my travel plans. five stars from me :-) 
5238,91314613,4/8/16,55808948,Stine Gregers,"Bens apartment was just as pictured.  Perfect for 3 people staying in New York. The place was clean and cozy with all the ameneties you need. The apartment was right next to the subway and in walking distance of cozy restaurant and bar areas. 
Ben was not in town while we were staying, but Ben was very helpful and accomodating with arrival and departure details and arranged everything to suit our needs. We would recommend Bens place to other guests looking for at nice place to stay in New York."
5238,93894905,14/8/16,63888482,Flor,"Fue todo de acuerdo a lo pautado, la zona estaba bien. "
5238,106921458,8/10/16,17353650,Claire,"Ben's apartment was exactly as described and a great base to explore the LES and East Village. The apartment was clean and comfortable. We didn't actually make any use at all of the kitchen (so many great places to eat in NY), but it seemed like it had everything we could have needed.

We didn't meet Ben, but, we spoke as soon as we got in and he made sure everything was okay and we had everything we needed. He knew we had friends staying not too far away and had advice on how best to get to their area. He was a great host, very patient with our late arrival, and made us feel very welcome in his home. "
5238,124700824,2/1/17,27263873,Barnabé,C'était super ! Très très bon emplacement et Ben est un hôte très gentil et très serviable.
5238,142514554,8/4/17,105340862,Noelia,"Estuvimos con mi novio 15 dias alojados en el departamento de Ben. Es un espacio lindo y comodo(para dos personas) para descansar despues de un dia de mucho recorrer. La cocina y el baño se encuentran muy bien equipados. La ubicacion del departamento es excelente, a pocas cuadras del Distrito Financiero. Con una estacion del subte F en la esquina, con el cual se llega muy directamente al aeropuerto JFK. En cuanto al barrio, como dice Ben, puede parecer un poco desprolijo por su cercania con el Barrio Chino, pero es muy seguro. Los unicos incovenientes que tuvimos fueron con la tina, la cual se tapa y el agua caliente dura 15 minutos y tarda bastante tiempo en volverse a calentar.Cabe destacar que Ben se ofrecio a pasar a limpiar el departamento en el medio de la estadia y a destapar la tina, aliviando un poco el problema.Como conclusion final, el departamento esta bueno, volveria sin dudas y lo recomiendo ampliamente. Respecto a Ben, es muy amable y flexible con los horarios de check in y check out."
5238,145860602,20/4/17,95318488,Daniel,"Es un departamento ideal para dos. En el barrio chino,  con un super en la esquina. El Dpto tiene todo en bue n estado y Ben es un anfitrión ideal. Excelente opción "
5238,204944734,20/10/17,42157744,William,"Great locations for public transit, The F train is few steps away, The 6 train is a nice walk thru China Town, the D train is on Delancy about a 5-minute walk and you are close to the highway if you cab frequently. The Spanish restaurant next door food is amazing, as well as amazing Mexican Vegan restaurant up canal street. Laundry Mat and a pharmacy is next door as well, everything you need is within walking distance.  Perfect for a couple, its cozy apt with a very small kitchen area so if you cook it can be challenging. If you want to live like a New Yorker and walk to Manhattan Bridge for photos or perhaps walk across Brooklyn Bridge or even walk to East Village or Soho this is a great location."
5238,216913163,6/12/17,145294033,Julian,Ben was a great host and very friendly. The handover went smoothly and quickly. He answered my questions quickly and friendly. We will gladly come again.
5238,218398832,12/12/17,66310731,Petra,"We stayed at Ben's flat for 5 days. His place is situated in a great location right next to the subway, which is helpful. The apartment was clean and nicely decorated. Good communication. A good size flat for a couple. A few drawbacks worth mentioning when paying around £800 for the stay: a) pictures are somewhat missleading-the flat is VERY dark, almost no natural light so not suitable for staying in during the day, b) shower does not drain properly (which seems to be quite a frequent problem judging by the reviews) and toilet kept on blocking (Ben was responsive to this though), c) no cable TV though it is advertised and the Netflix subscription ran out on the second day of our stay so had to swich to our own - not a big deal but probably shouldn't happen when paying quite a lot of money for the stay. Overall, it was an okay stay (we only really slept in the flat and the flat was clean) but next time we would book something cheaper in Brooklyn as it is only one stop away from this apartment."
5238,226435423,10/1/18,131235148,Catherine,Ben’s place is great! Good location if you are wanting an authentic NYC experience. Location is right next to Subway so you can get up town conveniently. Ben is really friendly and had great communication. We would stay there again for sure.
5238,235656129,17/2/18,81204,Ruby,"My husband, 2 kids and I came into town for Chinese New Year to see my extended family. The location of this place is amazing - right in the middle of China Town, East Broadway subway station is right downstairs, playground across the street, cafes and restaurants all within walking distance. The place is small but we had enough room for even the 4 of us! Ben was a great host - attentive and flexible. Definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in this area.. and we'll look to book this place again when we come back in future years!"

5295,2163,8/5/09,14300,Nazim,"Lena definitely has an awesome place in a prime location. The renovations are top-notch. 

The place is just 1 bloc away from Columbia University, 3 blocks from Central Park, only 1 block away from Line 1, 2, 3 trains and 3 blocks from subway A, B, and C, and the neighbourhood is full of great places to eat, drink and shop. 

All this only 20 minutes from downtown... Great experience altogether!"
5295,3429,1/6/09,15393,Sara,Lena was so helpful and communicative throughout the entire process. Our arrival and departure was incredibly smooth- she arranged for her doorman to have the keys right when we arrived. Her building is beautiful and we had no problems getting anywhere- the 2 metro stops got us everywhere we wanted to be. We couldn't have picked a better place to stay for my first trip to the city!

5295,8949,4/9/09,27736,Jessica,"Had a great time! Her place was really clean with a nice modern bathroom. The location was also amazing. We loved that it wasn't right downtown in the middle of tourist-y areas but very close to a few different subway lines.
Also tons of restaurants, grocery stores and other things right around the corner.
Definitely recommended."
5295,10987,22/9/09,15728,Ray,"Lena's friendly warm welcome and willingness to advise made our stay most enjoyable. Her apartment is very comfortable and with every convenience within close proximity, it was a great location for our stay in New York. Close to Central and Riverside parks with great places to eat, and a choice of 2 subway lines plus buses close by made getting around Manhattan easy. We highly recommend Lena's. "
5295,12873,9/10/09,28443,Nicole,"Lena's apartment was great and she was a great host. She answered any transportation, restaurant, grocery store questions that we had.

5295,13407,12/10/09,44097,Joanna,Lena was a fantastic host - even though she was on vacation at the time we visited she made sure we felt at home and made arrangements for pick up and drop off of the key. The apartment is really nice and great value - great place to chill out and unwind after a hectic day downtown.

Am quite familiar with NY and this met all of my expectations.  For a new visitor to NY, this is an excellent home base, with all the comforts of home.

Lena was out of town during our visit, but through email, text messaging, phone calls, her notes and recommendations, etc., everything worked super smooth.  Very delightful person and looking forward to meeting her on our next visit.

Would definitely stay there again, and would recommend to friends.

Thanks, Lena!!

"
5295,55850,21/6/10,139515,Heather,"I and a friend stayed at Lena's one bedroom apt for 5 nights. The over all experience was good. The location was a very nice area for us. The door man abel was very helpful and nice, really made us feel comfortable and helped us with our stay. The subway is close and there is a store and great pub restaurant on the same block a step away. Although keep in mind, this is a personal apt, and here is no professional cleaning. We did our own cleaning and was respectful of her belongings that were in her apt. Overall Lena was very kind and her place was a Life Saver. Thanks again Lena:) ps. You have a wonderful collection of books and we felt very comfortable. I can see you have a great heart I really appreciate you opening up your home to us. Take care!"

The renovated kitchen and bathroom are especially pleasant, Coming back to the apartment after big days of experiencing New York was like coming home. The location is excellent - in a quiet part of Manhattan, close to supermarkets and restaurants. With the subway only 5 minutes away, all of New York is virtually at your doorstep. We would highly recommend Lena's apartment. Thanks Lena!"

The apartment is exactly as described and the host is very attentive to all details. Everything was clean and well organized. The only thing that could be a bit better is the bed mattress, but this is a small detail that won't prevent you from having a good experience. "
5295,9482346,30/12/13,1721797,Jennifer,"The apt was just as pictured. Everything was clean and welcoming. Lena was very communicative: she gave accurate directions and, because she couldn't be there, she left an additional contact person in case I needed help. My mom and I needed a place to stay at the last minute around the holidays when things with friends fell through and Lena was very accommodating on short notice. I'm very familiar with NYC and this is a great neighbourhood (right around the corner from the outstanding ""Absolute Bagels"") and very close to public transit.

This apt would be ideal for 1-2 people on their first trip to NYC or someone just looking to stay in the city for a while. I felt at home as soon as I arrived. The building is secure and the neighbourhood is quiet. If I ever need a place to stay in NYC again, I would come here without hesitation! Thanks again Lena!"

The place looked as it was specified in the information available on the web. Lena is a very nice girl and inspires a lot of confidence. On arrival at the apartment, she gave us important details about the site and some recommendations to better enjoy our visit. The department has everything a visitor needs, and above all is very tidy and clean. The doorman of the building is very friendly. The area is fairly quiet and very close to two subway stations, which is important to organize trips into the downtown area. We strongly recommend to anyone who wants to visit NY stay in the department of Lena. At least that's what I hope to do when you return to NY .. Thanks for everything .. You are fantastic Lena"

The apartment is located in a very nice area of New York. Central Park is so near, you could almost jump in from the window. There are a lot of trendy bars and restaurants in close vicinity.
The rooms are really as shown in the pictures and very clean. The bedroom has an air conditioner which is pretty cool in the hot nights. The bathroom is a little jewel in blue with a great shower (which I loved to use). We didn't used the kitchen but it looked also clean and very functional. 
Lena wasn't there but she gave us a lot of informations and recommendations. She always was very helpful and answered potential questions very quickly. I definitely would book again."

When we entered into her apartment, we found no surprise!  What you see on the website, it's truly what you will get.  She has a guitar, good microwave, and good speakers.  Although I play a guitar, i do not touch it. We personally do not leave any fingerprints on those equipment because we value her space.  It's also my promise to her that I will keep her apartment clean.  On the first day when we arrived, I asked my son not to touch anything of the shelf.   I also feel obliged to clean her kitchen and floor.  I think she appreciated it because she mentioned the kitchen was spotless (Website hidden by Airbnb) am happy to stay in her place and thank her for sharing her space.  We would definitely go back to her apartment when we visit New York.  Thanks Lena.   (also she responded my inquiries quickly, just like what other said)."

5441,1231,2/4/09,9703,Jimena,"Kate was the best host we could wish for, she's been living in new york for a long time so she has lots of recommendations. The breakfast was spectacular, we could skip straight to dinner. She's such an interesting person to talk to we didn't want to leave the house. Also the location was excellent,best of both worlds, Hell's Kitchen with inexpensive ethnic restaurants and dive bars and buzzing Times Square at equal distance.

Kate fue la mejor anfitriona que podiamos desear, ha vivido en ny durante mucho tiempo así que podía recomendarnos muchos sitios. Sus desayunos eran espectaculares, podíamos saltarnos la comida y pasar a la cena directamente. Es una persona (que además de hablar perfecto español) es muy interesante para conversar, no queríamos dejar la casa. La situación de la casa era excelente, teníamos la zona de Hell's Kitchen con sus restaurantes étnicos y bares muy auténticos y Times Square a la misma distancia. 

We will definitely be back.
Estamos deseando volver con Kate."

Her apartment is in a really fun neighborhood.  It is a few minutes walk from Times Square and only a block from the subway and a large strip of great, diverse, and yummy restaurants.  Central Park, Rockefeller Center, and tons of attractions and shows are all in easy walking distance as well.  Kate is a wonderful and thoughtful host.  I highly recommend her place.  "
5441,3307,30/5/09,13223,Lizeth,"The reviews are a vivid testimony of Kate's hospitality, thoughtful and friendly nature no doubt! Even though I stayed a short period of time, she managed to make me feel at home and also made some excellent suggestions that otherwise I would've not considered. The apartment provides a warm & cozy vibe and the layout is great and the bedroom and bathroom very clean. The location is the best for it is walking distance to Broadway, Times Square, Central Park, etc., and as a female traveling alone the area felt safe to walk at night. If you are looking for a place to stay, search no more, stay at Kate's! "
5441,3557,4/6/09,16445,Lorraine,"Kate really deserves the positive reviews she has received from other clients.  She is welcoming and helped me choose some of the activities to do in the 4 days I was with her.  The location of the apartment is great and everything is clean and homely.  I recommend Kate´s apartment (either the room or the whole apartment) to anyone who wants a safe, comfortable home while they are in New York - especially other single females."
5441,4049,15/6/09,12844,Morten,We had a great stay at Kates place. Kate made us feel right at home from the moment we made our entrance. She was very helpful and recommended some great places to eat. The place was clean and very central located.

5441,7222,11/8/09,25128,Marika,"Being at Kate's was a beautiful experience! 
Kate is a wonderful host, the flat is nice and clean and it takes five minutes to walk to Times Square.
Only one warning: be careful, you could be trapped by her beautiful library and spend all your time in New York reading her books!  ;-))"
5441,7776,19/8/09,28341,Jeff,"Kate gets an A+ as a host. She's fun,easy going,interesting to talk with and wants to make sure her guest(s) are comfortable. She knows her city well- so take advantage of her knowledge and insight to enjoying all that NYC has to offer.  If you stay with Kate - you are close to Times Square and Central Park - the hustle and bustle of the city. Having said this - the apartment is cozy, clean and quiet. I really appreciated that she had wireless internet access."
5441,9793,12/9/09,25167,Maria,"We spent four nights at Kate´s apartment. It was a new experience for us to share an apartment with someone who we didn´know before. We can highly recomend Kate´s apartment, it´s very well located and clean, but overall
Kate gave us a very warm hospitaliy. Thanks Kate for your kindness and we hope to visit you again."
5441,10587,19/9/09,8590,Heiko,Simply the best! 
5441,12083,1/10/09,39296,Kristina,"We are really proud to say it was very nice meeting Kate during our visit in NY city and I promise we will be back! Thank you Kate for everything! We had a great experience staying in your house and renting a bedroom. She is so friendly and the best hostess you can ever meet. She even got for us a special ground coffee that we could have the coffee the way we drink back home :) you are amassing!  The room itself is quite small, but it doesn't matter, because you are not looking for posh environment when you are here to explore NY. The apartment itself is very close to all main sightseeing points, metro stations, two block away from the Time square. Kate provided all maps and mention the prioritized places of interest in the city. We saw as much we could see in three days and we had the best time staying with Kate. It's so clean and safe, as somebody mentioned. Don't hesitate to use this smart opportunity to rent this apartment or room rather staying in an expensive hotel! Best luck and have a great time in NY. Best regards to Kate as well :)"
5441,12965,10/10/09,30717,Bonnie,"It seemed like quite an adventure to rent someone's bedroom, definitely a new experience for us!  As soon as we arrived we felt comfortable with Kate.  She is warm and comfortable to be with.  Her suggestions of places to go and restaurants to try were most helpful!  And we appreciated the clean, very safe place to land after exhausting days!"
5441,14669,23/10/09,37517,Nicola,"Well what can you say about Kate and her (Website hidden by Airbnb) was all really too lovely for words!
Great location, incredibly hospitable, clean and homely with everything you might need in a room as a base for exploring one of the busiest cities in the world. Kate has fantastic local knowledge (ask for her restaurant recommendations they are all very good, especially the Thai) and will be happy to help you out deciding what to do next as a “local tourist”.
It was a pleasure to meet Kate and to stay in her apartment; I would definitely stay with her again.  She made us feel so comfortable and relax. A real pleasure Kate, “Thank you”

5441,150141,7/12/10,259230,Courtney,"This was our first experience using Airbnb, and it was a great one! Kate was a wonderful host. Our flight was delayed and she waited at the apartment to greet us and give us keys. She even had our favorite breakfast snacks, juices, and coffee waiting on us each morning. Her knowledge of the city blew us away and we really enjoyed our conversations with her. She was also very quick to respond to emails I sent before our visit. The apartment was very clean. She had clean towels and sheets ready when we arrived. All around...Kate was wonderful and we will definitely stay with her next time we visit New York. "
5441,319165,17/6/11,594176,Andrea,"This was our first experience with airbnb and it was definitely great. Although Kate could not be there when we were in NY (as she had informed us in advance), communication with her was really good and quick. She organized that a friend of hers was there to welcome us and also stayed at the appartment during our stay, which was great, as we got lots of information. We had some nice and interesting chats, too. Regarding the appartment: it is very clean and has a great location - close to lots of restaurants, Times Square, Central Park, public transport etc. We would definitely recommend staying at Kate's place and would stay there again, when we get the chance to visit New York again. "
5441,444906,14/8/11,87272,Jane,"Kate is an absolutely wonderful person and host. She made me feel secure and comfortable, and her place is the perfect spot for access to all the city."
5441,538536,17/9/11,822745,Alison,"Kate is a very helpful and friendly host. Hers is a genuine New York apartment, small and right in the middle of everything: Times Square, Hell's Kitchen, Broadway. But miraculously it's quiet and peaceful in her apartment. I recommend the Hop On Hop Off bus whose base is just around the corner in 8th Ave. "
5441,576137,27/9/11,1039076,Tyler,"Kate is an incredible host and just a wonderful person in general.  One of the best parts of my stay was just hanging out and talking with Kate because she has some of the most interesting and funny stories to tell about New York and also her travels.  She's super personable, and (as her library will reflect) she is an intellect.  She wants the best for people.  I would come home late at night because I'd been working all day, and Kate would make me these awesome smoothies.  After only a few days staying with her, I feel like I've known her for years and consider Kate a friend of mine.  I would recommend her to anybody and everybody looking for a wonderful stay in the heart of Manhattan for an unbeatable price!  "
5441,599251,4/10/11,1196888,Lise,"Kate, she is very kind and interesting person.
 She has been very helpful and always avalaible when I needed anything.
The apartment  and the room was clean, quite and very comfortable.
 It's near 3 subway,  Five minute away from Centrale Park and Brodways etc 
There is many shops around and Internet cafe as well.
I'll recommand you and all my friend to stay with Kate.
She just amazing and we all want someone to meet someone nice in our holiday. 
I 'll stay there on my next trip in NYC  for sure."
5441,616441,10/10/11,286109,Clementine,"Kate was a wonderful host. She gave me information about what to do in the neighbourhood and has several maps and guidebooks available for her guest. The apartment was clean, comfortable and very well located (two avenues from Time Square with plenty of nice small restaurants). I would definitely recommend staying by Kate the next time you go to NYC... A bientôt Kate !"

Kate's apartment is such a great place to be in New York:  location, comfort, and the little etc. like great coffee and conversation.  I'd especially recommend it to a new visitor to the city because you'll come away knowing one of the coolest people there.  Kate is easy going, accommodating of your needs, and tremendous fun to spend time around. "
5441,740445,23/11/11,507022,Cecile,"Great place and fantastic location, access to everything.  You couldn't stay in a more convenient location.  There are lots of stairs to climb but that didn't bother me.  Kate is the hostess with the mostess - she's a very kind  person and genuinely cares how her guests are doing.  I stayed there on my own for a few nights and the couple of nights Kate stayed too we had a great laugh.  Native New Yorkers always know the best places to go!  This was my first air bnb experience and it was an excellent one.  Would highly recommend Kate's place and will definitely stay there again.  I consider Kate a friend."
5441,765490,5/12/11,1421292,Pamela,"Kate was a wonderful host who made me comfortable from the very first moment. She offered me food, great stories, on-going consideration, and many useful tips. It is obvious that she cares about her guests and they her, as a former one came to visit and several more contacted Kate to share news. It couldn't have been nicer."
5441,1127733,14/4/12,1800285,Kara,"Kate is an amazing host. She really goes the extra mile to make you feel welcome. Kate is lots of fun to visit with and has vast knowledge of the city which she is always eager to share. Without her advice we would have missed out on alot of great experiences. Kate's apartment is really nice, very clean and spacious.  Not to mention a great location! Any time we are in NYC we will definitely stay here. "
5441,1200739,30/4/12,1864978,Alessandra,"Ottima esperienza! 
Kate è una spendida padrona di casa, gentile, simpatica, intelligente, interessante e sempre disponibile nel dare suggerimenti e consigli per muoversi a NYC.
La camera è piccolina (noi siamo stati in 2) ma questo non è un problema se si considera la posizione centrale dell'appartamento vicinissimo a Time Square ed comodissimo alla metropolitana. La zona è ricca di ristoranti (in particolare la 9 Ave) e negozi di ogni tipo ma allo stesso tempo molto tranquilla. Kate ci ha fornito di asciugamani e lenzuola al nostro arrivo.
Ogni mattina ci ha fatto trovare the, caffè, succhi, latte, marmellata e pane di qualità per la nostra colazione.
Nella casa inoltre è anche disponibile il wi-fi.
Io la consiglierei a tutti quelli ricercano un meraviglioso soggiorno nel cuore di Manhattan per un prezzo imbattibile!
A presto Kate!

5441,1252285,9/5/12,418316,Maria Eugenia,"Fue una estadía maravillosa!!!
Estar con  Kate fue la mejor elección que pudimos haber hecho en este viaje.
Su casa está especialmente llena de energía y buena onda, es pequeña pero bonita... kate es excelente anfitriona, nos dio el desayuno todas las mañanas  y además hace un pan Irlandés casero muy ricoooo !!!
Nos ha  llenado de información, nos dio muchos mapas y libros de la ciudad, nos ha aconsejado donde ir, como ir y qué hacer...
Hemos compartidos cenas y charlas de nuestras vidas, muy interesantes.
Volveremos sin duda a visitarla en nuestro próximo viaje ..
Kate es realmente adorable !!!!
"
5441,1316001,21/5/12,1860842,Evan,"Kate is the perfect host. From the moment I arrived, my needs and expectations were met and exceeded.  She was there to meet me at the apartment.  There was always coffee, or tea, brewing and food ready to be eaten.  Kate was there to lend an ear and to share a funny story.  She even showed me round the city on more than one occasion.  The apartment is exactly as pictured in the photos.  It is homely and comfortable and is the perfect place to recharge the batteries and escape the hustle and bustle of Manhatten. If Kate’s friend Omar is around, make sure he takes you on a tour of the city - easily one of the highlights of my trip. Whenever I was at the apartment or out and about with Kate I felt like a local, which is exactly why I chose airbnb.  If you are looking for a genuine New York experience at a reasonable price, this is it.  Thanks again Kate for all the wonderful memories and I’ll see you again soon.  "
5441,1405440,3/6/12,237671,Patricia,"Kate is friendly, laid back and very accomodating.  I was there for a conference in Times Square.  Location was excellent.  Thanks, Kate!
"
5441,1443055,9/6/12,2281417,Simone,"Confermo il giudizio espresso da altri: ottima location a due minuti da Times Square, stanza piccola ma letto comodo e bagno pulito. Kate è una splendida persona sempre disponibile a darti una mano.
Se cercate una stanza e non un appartamento, è la scelta ideale!
5° piano senza ascensore."
5441,1498681,17/6/12,2308582,Joy,"My boyfriend and I stayed for 6 days to do a professional workshop and our experience was absolutely fantastic! It was our first airbnb stay, and Kate was extremely accommodating, helpful, and friendly. Whether you're looking to have a personal experience with a local, or just need a quiet place to work or rest with no interruptions, this is the place for you. The room was clean, VERY quiet, A/C with a large bed and a small closet space. Everything was as, or even better than described, and there were no surprises when we arrived. Kate is great with communication, and answered our concerns and questions quickly. My boy friend, a chef, cooked a gourmet meal for the three of us so we could share something unique together. I would definitely stay here again and consider Kate a very experienced hostess, and someone who is great at creating a personal connection with her guests. "
5441,1610321,2/7/12,992103,Anne & Lars,"Wow! After more than two weeks at Kate's apartment I am convinced: Kate is the most amazing host! She is incredibly accommodating, friendly, considerate and has a great sense of humor! Her place was very centrally located and the room itself is quiet, clean with a A/C for the warm days. I will definitely stay with Kate the next time I am in New York!"
5441,1901576,6/8/12,1932189,Lidia,"My sister and I really enjoyed our stay at Kate's apartment. The place is right in the heart of Manhattan and is close to nearly everything we needed. Kate is a very welcoming and caring host, we always felt safe and secure at her apartment and she gave us a lot of privacy while always being available to talk or give a useful advice. We really liked her place and the room, despite of seeming small, fit two us well; the bed was really comfortable and the WiFi and air conditioner worked fine. After spending almost a month at Kate's place, it became like a second home to us - I would definitely recommend staying with Kate, she is an amazing and interesting person and her home is great!"
5441,1951164,11/8/12,3021669,Tika,Kate was an awesome host!  Very engaging and helpful with good advice on what to do and see.  She was extremely hospitable and sweet.  Can't beat the location: just a few minutes from Times Square and some GREAT restaurants close by.  The climb up the stairs was pretty brutal but I guess it was a good workout for my muscles...
5441,9264112,17/12/13,10626111,Yunlu,The reservation was canceled 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5441,17302511,10/8/14,18083712,Ally,"Kate was amazing, I loved staying with her. The place was beautifully located in the heart of midtown and Times Square and so peaceful at night. She was very welcoming and made me feel safe in a new city. She even helped bring my heavy luggage up. We had great talks at night and she recommended great places to visit during the day. My room was very private, clean and nice. Kate stayed on her side of the apartment and didn't bother me at all. Would stay here again!"
5441,17588072,14/8/14,18766325,Wesley,Great location. It's about a block away from Time Square. Kate was very helpful too.

5441,18844941,1/9/14,18936393,Shielamarie,"Kate was an amazing host :) she gave us great directions to get to places that we needed to go to. She is very welcoming and nice. Her place was a great place to stay at because it is very very close to Time Square. It is also close to the subways and it was easy to get there from La Guardia Airport. When me and my friend stayed there, we stayed out late at Time Square and we felt safe walking to her place, the neighbourhood is safe. I would recommend this place to anyone :) It is a really nice walk from Time Square!! :D We had an amazing time at her place and NYC!!"
5441,19319290,10/9/14,18216253,Edwin,"Maravilloso lugar muy acogedor y con todo lo necesario, super bien ubicado, cerca del movimiento en new york, transporte y demás, Kate es una excelente anfitriona amable y cordial, muy interesante, habla español y nos organizó para movernos por la ciudad, en conclusión espectacular!!!!"
5441,19480037,13/9/14,20232607,Rachael,"If your priorities are location and affordability, then this is the place for you.   It's a small one bedroom, 5th floor walk up in a great location.  It's right on the border of the theater district and hell's kitchen.  It's perfect if you enjoy walking, great food, and central park.  We walked around the city all day and then came back for dinner in hells kitchen.  You can find every type of food imaginable, within a block or two of the apartment.  And Kate was great at communicating with us, even though she was out of town.  That being said, there were a few inconveniences we had to deal with during our stay.  Since Kate was not home we had the added bonus of privacy, but when we arrived we had to buzz a neighbor to let us into the building.  Another guest had just left the apartment, and with Kate out of town the bathroom wasn't clean and the drains were clogged.  But my husband was able to unclog the drains and clean.  I contacted Kate about this and she very considerately offered to give a $50 rebate which we appreciated.  Also, there is an unfortunate elderly neighbor across the hall who often leaves his door open and the smell of urine fills the hall.  The elderly neighbor also plays his television too loud in the middle of the night, but my husband asked him to turn it down and he did.  All in all it was a great trip, just be prepared to deal with a few obstacles."
5441,19728546,17/9/14,3671547,Guido,"We had a great zip of NYC, thanks to Kate's cosy and perfectly situated apt! Off course, we were exploring the city most of the time, but when we stayed in, we really felt at home. The place is clean, the shower works very good (big plus!), everything we needed was there. We met Kate on our last morning around, when she really helped us out with our bus tickets. Thanks Kate, it was very nice meeting you, best of luck and hope to see you again!

All in all a great place to stay.  Would come back any time."
5441,20950443,8/10/14,17117356,Ryan,"Kate did a wonderful job hosting my wife and I during our 4 day stay.  She was not only accommodating and friendly, she also knew a thing or two about NYC!  We checked out her recommendations for everything from Broadway tickets to ramen shops and were not disappointed.  Her apartment is extremely convenient to all the city has to offer and comfortably fit us.  The only thing to be aware of is the five flights of stairs on the way up!  This was a welcome bit of exercise though and allowed her unit to have a wonderful view.  We look forward to staying there again."
5441,21378767,16/10/14,19944325,Rafa,"Desde antes de nuestra llegada a Nueva York, Kate estuvo pendiente de nosotros.
Estuvo enviandonos mensajes para poder ponernos de acuerdo para la entrega de llaves.
A nuestra llegada al alojamiento nos recibió para enseñarnoslo y darnos algunos consejos de qué ver y donde comer en Manhattan.
Fue de gran ayuda podernos comunicar con ella en castellano.
El apartamento és igual que se ve en las fotos, limpio y tal y como se describe en el anuncio.
La localización es excepcional, a 5 minutos a pie de Times Square.
Era nuestra primera experiencia con Airbnb y estamos encantados con ella y sobretodo con el trato de Kate.
Repetiriamos sin dudarlo.

It's in a nice, reasonably quiet area/building which is hard to find in Manhattan. Kate was very helpful with suggestions for places to eat and things to do.

The apartment's location is the best, we was able to walk to Central Park, Times Square or to the other turist targets, and the subway is also near. Kate was really helpful (although she couldn't be at home) she gave us useful New York maps and before the trip she gave us good advices how to get the easiest way to her apartment from JFK. Furthermore we had two big suitcases, and she helped us and brought downstairs one of them. I offer her for anybody who wants spend a great time in New York City and have a nice friend from there.

Even before i arrived i knew where and how i get Kate's place. She gave me (a first time NY traveller) perfect  advices how to get the easiest way to her apartment from JFK. 

The apartment's location is just steps away from Times Square, Rockefeller Plaza and Central Park. I was able to walk to all that places in ""minutes"". For other places the subway station (A-,E-,C-trains) is just 2 blocks away. Kate is so helpful giving me useful tips exploring New York, where to eat, getting the best coffee in town ;) and so on. I got to know NY in a very easy way, also places which you not found if  no one indicates you.
Anyone who will spend a great time in New York City in a central location with a personal touch I really recommend Kate and her apartement.
Kate, thank you very much for your kindness and the great time in NYC."

Thank you sooo much :)"

She gave us a lot of privacy, but at the same time helped us out a lot with our questions. Her place is very clean and cozy! It is conveniently located very close to subway stations, Times Square, broadway theatres, bars and restaurants! Next time we visit NYC again, we are definitely coming back! PS Don’t forget to visit Ippudo and Los Tacos No. 1 Kate!

5441,42158874,11/8/15,877187,Stephen,"Kate's place was clean, neat, and the super-convenient location made it possible to see two shows in one day with a stop at her place in between to change clothes.

She was always ready with reliable advice on transport, food, and activities.

We had a great time and look forward to staying with her again the next time we're in Manhattan."

And the location is so great that we always walk around to see Times Square, Broadway show and many other fantastic spots. If we travel to NY a second time, we will definitely choose Kate as our airbnb host!:)"

Kate was incredibly helpful and knowledgable and very engaging. Thanks Kate! "
5441,48550608,27/9/15,5884686,Oleg,"We spent a week at Kate's apartment and we can't imagine a better location for visiting the city. It is amazing returning home every day through the Times Square full of life. The apartment is very clean, the bathroom is new. The flat is not so big but it perfectly fits all the needs of two guests. It was nice talking to Kate at evenings and her recommendations regarding nearby placed to eat, transportation and touring the city were very useful. She knows the city very well and has great tips regarding almost everything you can do in the city. It was easy to communicate Kate for check-in and check-out. Kate provided everything we needed and gave us a lot of space so we felt very comfortable sharing the apartment with her."
5441,49219711,2/10/15,39522945,Betty,Kate家地理位置绝佳，到百老汇一个街区步行的距离。周边也是相对闹中取静，比较安全，有小卖店可以随时买点吃的喝的。我去的几天主人都不在家，所以得推着大箱子去几个街区外的一家咖啡店拿钥匙，不是很方便。床单枕套等等也都是跟青年旅舍一样得自己动手。房间没有照片是如此宽敞整洁，还是有太多杂物堆积，床及床品已经非常老旧。就当是地理位置抵了全部的房价吧。
5441,53046220,4/11/15,403622,Jean,"Kate é uma maravilhosa anfitriã , nos ajudou bastante com suas dicas . Foi extremamente solícita . Tivemos que chegar um pouco mais cedo para o check in e ela foi bem tranquila e amigável em relação a isso . O local fica a dois quarteirões da Times Square , perto de restaurantes , perto de estações de metrô , enfim perto de tudo. Kate sempre muito atenciosa. O único ponto negativo é porque o apartamento fica no quinto andar e o prédio não possui elevador , mas isso está descrito no anúncio . Certamente é um excelente local para se hospedar em Nova York se você quer ficar perto das principais atrações turísticas ."
5441,56494846,14/12/15,47633727,Jessi,"Kate was great! She was very flexible in arrival/check-out time, and was extremely helpful in providing many ways of getting from the airport to her place. Once we arrived, she had many helpful maps, menus, and suggestions for things to do and places to eat. Her apartment is in a great area - VERY close to subway, Times Square and many many other great tourist attractions. Would 100% recommend her and her place an option if you're looking for a place to stay in NYC. Thanks again, Kate! :) "
5441,58618736,3/1/16,16298398,Mario,"Kate was awesome, very kind and helpful. Her place is two crossings away from the Time Square, it was fantastic, you just hop out of your room and into NYC lifestyle. I stayed with my fiance and if I would visit NY again, i would love to be at Kate's place again. Thank You for everything."
5441,66259466,20/3/16,61810850,Yijian,"Kate was really helpful on everything about NYC. We had a relatively short trip, only 3 days. So Kate's apartment is perfect for us. We only want to have some good food and do some shopping. The location is amazing. Anywhere we want to go, we can basically walk there. And the neighborhood is surprisingly quiet, considering it's close to Time Square.
Also it's nice talking to Kate the night before we left. Definitely gonna consider this again."
5441,68477933,5/4/16,19079222,Rohan,"Another great stay at Kate's place.  As always, very welcoming and helpful.  Due to train cancellations, I was almost stranded in New York. Kate rescued the situation by researching all of the other travel options and finding me one of the last seats on a bus heading out of town.  Really saved the day for me."
5441,69293562,10/4/16,31836935,Aymen,Excellent central location in Manhattan near many attractions. Kate was a good host and gave me a lot of information that helped me during my stay. 
5441,71095598,23/4/16,57978928,Kirsten,"Kate's apartment is wonderful. It's in a perfect location with especially easy access to the Broadway theaters and the Bryant Park area (I was in town to use the NYPL).  The room is spotlessly clean, very comfortable, and because it's tucked away from the street, quiet.  Kate herself is an incredibly kind, friendly, and extremely helpful host.  She's ready with any directions and recommendations you might need.  I really enjoyed getting to know her.  I hope we cross paths again!"
5441,75094077,18/5/16,8005023,Jose,"As advertised, the room is small but it is enough for a couple (more than 3 suitcases can be challenging maybe) to sleep and visit the city.  The location is perfect, really close to Times Square, the underground is nearby and easy to reach all the important places to visit. Kate is really friendly and always willing to help if you need it. She didn't have any problems with us leaving our luggage in the apartment until the time to go to the airport, for instance. I definitely recommend this apartment."
5441,75675204,22/5/16,66908700,Lionel,"Kate is awesome! she was very kind and helpful. We felt very comfortable in her apartment. Her house is so clean and tidy, and is so centrical.

5441,78673956,8/6/16,11370214,Meghan,"Thank you, Kate, for your hospitality!  Very quiet and safe place to stay. I very much appreciated the extra effort made to help me navigate my way from JFK to Manhattan. Kate was so great to provide me several options (with prices and necessary specific directions) which made arriving to a very busy city quite manageable.  As long as people are willing to go up 5 flights of stairs (which was fine with me) and share a bathroom (which was never a scheduling problem), then I'd recommend this booking. It's centrally located, easy to find, and most importantly safe and quiet.  Kate, was a gracious host. Thank you!!!"

Once we arrived there she handed out some maps and gave us local directions. The room was clean and she provided towels for showers,etc. We had a great time there. The location is superbe. Thanks for everything Kate."
5441,82375584,27/6/16,26099912,Becky,"Kate was not home during my visit but she was very good about arranging for me to get the key and making sure I got in okay. In general, she was a very responsive host. The apartment was exactly as pictured, clean and cozy. The five flights of stairs makes this a challenging location for anyone with large or heavy luggage. I would recommend this place to anyone traveling to Manhattan, especially people who want to sample the restaurants of Hell's Kitchen. "
5441,88749236,25/7/16,83619221,Neil,Kate took the initiative to send us ground transportation directions to make sure we made to her place easily. Everything was perfect!

Kate was extremely flexible with my arrival time, and we had no issues finding her place and getting settled in. Kate was welcoming and her place had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Towels, nice size bed with air conditioning, shower, etc. Everything was clean. The location was excellent and she made us feel very comfortable. We will most definitely be staying with her again the next time we go to NYC. This was our first AirBnB experience and because of Kate's hospitality, the expectations are very high going forward. Thank so much, Kate!  "
5441,92046598,7/8/16,5192210,Anh,"Kate was the best host we've met yet. She gave very detailed instructions on how to get to her place.  She was there to greet us and showed us around, and as we were discussing our plan for the day,  even walked us to Grand central station on her way to the Public library.
Kate  knew her city well, and that's a plus for her guests. We'd definitely stay at Kate's again when we want to get our fill of NYC Broadway. Thank you Kate for having us. "
5441,92397351,8/8/16,52995829,Kai,The place is nicer and cleaner than I expected. Location is perfect. Kate is the best host that I've ever met. I checked in very late but Kate was there to greet me and explained to me how to use everything. She was very kind to offer help at any time even before I arrived in New York. I definitely will stay at her place again next time I visit New York.

I want to tell her 'thanks a lot' again through this page."
5441,94169106,15/8/16,63821629,Maria,"My experience staying with Kate was short, but very nice and accommodating. My friend and I found the building easily and liked the fact that it was close to the subway, broadway and times square. The only challenge was the walk up and down stairs but manageable nonetheless. I would definitely stay with Kate again next time I'm in NYC."
5441,95647296,20/8/16,57034922,David,"Kate is an amazing host! I enjoyed her daily talks and advice. She is a savvy of NYC's history. She also tells you how to save money sightseeing the city. Although the room is small when you carry a lot of luggage, she arranged me some extra space to leave it and made me feel comfortable. "
5441,97025233,25/8/16,41284181,Shuwen,"Kate's place is as exactly as described. The room is nice and cool with air-conditioning and quite safe and quiet considering it's only few blocks away from Times Square. The location is just perfect, and actually it's within walkable distance to most of the attractions that you want to visit- Times Square, Broadway, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, Lincoln Center, Empire State Building, Macy's etc. Kate is friendly and helpful, she gave me a lot of travel advice and provided nice food and every essential. I so enjoyed my stay with Kate and night talks with her. I can't recommend enough and will definitely stay here again next time I travel to NY!"

Transportation is easy -- one stop to the Port Authority, two to Penn Station and subways nearby.  We hope to stay there every time we are in New York!"
5441,103092799,20/9/16,39548035,Tiago,We stayed 6 days and was everything fine as we expected. Kate is a really nice person and help us a lot in directions and nice tips and tricks in NYC. The location is superb and you will just walk to Time Square. Tks Kate and keep the Brazil flag with you! Bye and see you next time.

We not only had a great experience in NYC we've also made a new friend. Thanks again Kate!
5441,120732928,11/12/16,3057188,Megan,"Our stay at Kate's place was great because the location was really good, it was a good value and check-in and check-out were seamless. Kate was nice enough to give us directions to and from the airport, and we were able to check in right when we arrived in the city and leave our bags at Kate's after check-out so we didn't have to carry them around the city before our flight! It got 4/5 stars because my husband and I thought the bed was pretty hard and it made sleeping comfortably a challenge. Overall, I would definitely recommend Kate's place if you're looking for simplicity and a great location."
5441,133457042,22/2/17,43404667,Marion,"We had a great stay at Kate's place. Really good location (2-3 minutes to Times Square and Broadway by walking) and near to subway. Kate is really nice, cool and kind. She has been attentive to all our needs. And she knows really well the city so she can help you with your itinerary and restaurants. We recommend this place!"
5441,134692435,28/2/17,1260308,Michael,"This was our second time staying at Kate's.  She is an exceptional host, very interesting to talk with and knowledgeable about NYC history and attractions.  Her home is very clean and welcoming.  We will be back. "

Elle est toujours la lorsqu'on a besoin d'aide, fait tout pour qu'on se sente bien chez elle, et le petit déjeuné nous a bien fait plaisir lors de notre séjour. Emplacement parfait ! Les 5 étages sont parfait pour éliminer la bonne nourriture américaine :). Nous vous conseillons vivement ! Kate est au top ! Si nous retournons un jour à NYC on ira chez elle avec plaisir ! "
5441,141535115,3/4/17,56112576,Julie,"Kate is amazing! It was such a pleasure having her as a host, she is such an interesting and cultured woman, and really cares about her guests getting the best that they can. Complimentary breakfast was a HUGE plus for the big apple, and she was able to give us recommendations to several places! If it was not for Kate, this trip would have not been nearly as amazing as it was. Great location, great host, best airbnb experience for me yet!!"

5441,145867719,20/4/17,11319688,Chona,"Kate is a person with a lot of knowledge about the city. She is very hospitable and very generous. She provided us with a simple and yet delicious breakfast. Her place is very accessible to the most attractions in New York. Almost everything is walkable. Her place is safe and secure. Her place is also near restaurants, shopping mall, supermarkets, etc. You can find anything that you need. If you are looking for a budget place, her place is the answer to your need. But it is only good for 2 people. My only comment is that, what appears in the photos are not exactly accurate."

5441,153566830,21/5/17,101746414,Emma Hortensia,"A estadia no apartamento de Kate foi incrível! Ela foi uma ótima anfitriã! Desde o começo se preocupou em saber em qual aeroporto chegaríamos e assim que soube passou todas as informações para chegarmos no apartamento da forma mais fácil e econômica (indicando qual meio de transporte devíamos pegar, onde descer e o preço e ia costar!). Uma vez lá nos recebeu com muita gentileza, tínhamos tudo dentro do apartamento a nossa disposição. Ela passou ótimas dicas de lugares para comer segundo o que estávamos procurando e algumas outras boas dicas de como economizar um pouco em ingressos para alguns lugares turísticos como museus e coisas do tipo. A comunicação sempre foi fluente e ela sempre se assegurou que eu tivesse todas as informações que precisava. O apartamento é pequeno mas aconchegante e está a poucas quadras do time square e das maiores atrações turísticas de NY. Saímos a noite sem problema nenhum na questão de segurança. Em resumo: o apartamento da Kate é uma ótima opção para quem quer passar uns dias em NY e ter a melhor recepção!"
5441,159055517,9/6/17,115899361,Petra,"Kate ist super nett und sehr hilfsbereit! Die Lage ist echt super, zu Fuss kann man alles erreichen! Es besteht auch die Möglichkeit die U-Bahn zu nutzen. Das Bett war sehr bequem, nur ist das Zimmer ein wenig klein. Was aber nicht so schlimm ist, da man nur dort schläft. Obwohl die Lage sehr zentral liegt, ist es Nachts ruhig, so dass man fast nichts hört. Wenn wir nach NYC kommen, dann würden wir definitiv wieder zu Kate!! Es ist absolut weiter zu empfehlen. Thank you Kate! "
5441,162846382,22/6/17,82908527,Ketan,"Kate's place was perfect for discovering the city. The apartment is centrally located to most attractions around the city, along with very close to the subway. The apartment is on the 5th floor, just something to keep in mind, and the bedroom is small but works great for two people. Kate was super helpful and accommodating!"
5441,167097115,5/7/17,82983136,Melanie,"Es war ein toller Aufenthalt in NYC. Kate hat uns vor der Reise schon sehr unterstützt, die Kommunikation war problemlos sowie der Check-in.
Das Zimmer ist klein, aber für zwei Personen ausreichend.
TIPP: nehmt nicht zu viel Gepäck mit ;)

Der Times Square ist fußläufig in nur 5 min erreichbar. Die Lage ist also Perfekt!
Kate war eine tolle Gastgeberin!"
5441,169493190,12/7/17,133265466,Keegan,"Our stay with Kate was our first Air BnB experience and it couldn't have been better! Kate is friendly, funny, super helpful and very accommodation. Mention that you like something and she'll have checked the local deli to see if they have it. Ask a question and expect it to be comprehensively answered with a joke or two (P.s. Ask her about bird watching in Central Park if you want a laugh). Kate's place isn't big or fancy, but if you're looking for a simple place that is amazingly close to EVERYTHING (Time Square = 1 street away, Broadway = 1 street away,  Subway = 2 streets away, the greatest pizza ever! = 5 minute walk, Central Park = 10 minute walk) look no further! If ever I return to NYC I will happily return to Kate's for some more bagels and coffee, humour and it's great location!

Even before we checked in to her home she made us feel safe by answering all emails and questions, she was very helpful all the way! Kate's home is very close to Times Square, so basically it is in walking distance of lot's of great locations in midtown, like Broadway, Hell's Kitchen, Central Park, 5 Th Avenue, Empire State Building, Bryant Park, and several subway stations. It was a perfect place to stay if you want to see and get to know New York on your feet! Taking the Subway either north or south was super easy too. Lots of places to dine in the surrounding area. Kate is a very welcoming soul, she opend up her home for us to feel comfortable. We had great conversations with Kate, she is a smart woman with lots of knowledge, and she is funny too! Every morning we had a good and simple breakfast, it was so nice to eat before we went out on our daily New York journies. Her place is excactly like described on Airbnb. It is small, but more than big enough to sleep, eat, shower and have good conversations. We would definitely go back and stay with Kate another time, she made us feel safe, and that was important to us. Thank you Kate!!"
5441,183211052,16/8/17,111086918,Chelsey,Kate has a lovely place about a 3 minute walk from times square. She is a lovely host and made us feel very welcome and was very helpful with check in and everything else. It's a little hard to maintain a temperature in the bedroom but it's nothing major really. It's just such a convenient place to stay even if it is up 5 flights of stairs! Very lovely lady and lovely location! Thanks very much Kate for a great stay.
5441,185041490,20/8/17,135427929,McKenzie,"For the first time staying in an airbnb, Kate made this process smooth and pain free! With giving help with transportation to making sure we knew all the good places to go, she was an excellent host! Only downfall would be the five flights of stairs but that just gave us time to work off all the food we ate! Overall excellent experience and excellent location! Being right down from the subway and time square made this location excellent! When we return to NYC, Kate's apartment will be the first choice!"
5441,190535475,4/9/17,8751598,Isabel,"Kate is amazing as a hoster! Even if we can not meet up, she was taking care of our stay from all the perspectives. The location of the apartment is in the heart of Manhatttan, two minutes walk to Times Square but in a quiet and paceful place. It is a marvellous experience! We will go back for sure to Kate's place!"
5441,193203149,12/9/17,127713955,Santiago,"Fue nuestra primera experiencia en Airbnb! Kate fue muy amable, atenta a cualquier cosa que necesitaramos, su casa tenía excelente ubicacion. Sin duda volveríamos a hospedarnos allí."
5441,198201677,28/9/17,111165663,Ana,"Kate is a fantastic host! Her place is close to everything,  so you can avoid the subway most of the times.
She was really friendly, and helped us when we were felling a little bit lost in the big Manhattan. 
I had a superb 28th birthday in New York! Gracias!!"
5441,202000884,9/10/17,3483155,Michael,Kate was warm and welcoming and the room was perfect for our needs . Would definitely stay here again .
5441,206049262,23/10/17,143122070,Becka,"Kate was wonderful! Very informational and friendly, will definitely be back!"
5441,208924532,3/11/17,39584190,Aoife,"Kate's place is exactly as described, and was the perfect base for us to explore NYC. The apartment is surrounded by great restaurants in Hell's Kitchen and also within easy walking distance to Times Square, Broadway and Central Park. Highly reccomend."
5441,209915559,6/11/17,146870559,Mindy,"Kate’s home is amazing—cozy and clean, and in the heart of Times Square. It was only minutes from theaters and restaurants, in a safe neighborhood. Kate goes above and beyond all expectations, from first contact, and provided transit directions from the airport. I truly enjoyed my stay and getting to know Kate. She was extremely courteous and helpful, providing great suggestions for things to do and see. This was my first Airbnb experience so I don’t have anything to compare it to, but Kate definitely sets the bar high! If her place is available, don’t hesitate to book it. It’s great for people like me who wanted to see shows without being far. It’s very close to the subway, too. Thanks for your great hospitality, Kate!"
5441,213712408,22/11/17,155247669,Haochen,"Kate's apartment is enough for two  people to live and the room is clean.
Kate always tells local information and travel tips to us.
I think the AirBnb posted the wrong address of the apartment, but everything is good. It is easy to find out."
5441,216606536,4/12/17,47818737,Rune,"Beliggenheden er helt perfekt. I gangafstand fra alting på Manhattan. Nogle få hundrede meter fra Times Square og kun en blok fra Subway. Også nemt at komme til fra JFK Airport med tog. Værelset er meget lille, men brugbart. Vi havde lige lidt nok plads til vores kæmpe kuffert. Men det fungerede fint. Udsigten fra værelset er til en murstensvæg. Det er en klassisk ældre og meget lille New York lejlighed. Det er en helt autentisk oplevelse af, hvordan det rent faktisk er at bo i New York, hvis man ikke er mangemillionær. Kate er meget sød, venlig og hjælpsom, og ved alt hvad der er værd at vide om New York. Hun gav os mange virkeligt gode tips om bl.a. transport, mad, museer mv. Første gang allerede inden vi kom, hvor hun sendte en god beskrivelse af transporten fra lufthavnen."
5441,217955884,10/12/17,68136531,Martin,"Für uns war es die erste airbnb erfahrung und hätte besser nicht sein können.
Schon vor der ankunft gibt kate super tipps bzgl transport vom flughafen zu ihr.
Auch während des aufenthaltes ist sie sehr zuvorkommend und hilfsbereit.
Es gibt ein einfaches, aber super leckeres frühstück - bagels und kaffee oder tee.
Das zimmer selbst ist etwas klein, würde dies aber nicht bemängeln, denn man verbringt ja die zeit in nyc sowieso nicht im zimmer."
5441,222775636,30/12/17,98299097,Brian,We loved how close it is to Times Square with  lots of sights to see and how close to the subway and to food stores and shops of all sorts are just blocks away. Kate's place is a great place to stay for couples or even single travelers and she is very accommodating to your needs and if you want your privacy and to just keep to yourself she's more then understanding. You will not be disappointed if you decide to stay with her!
5441,223678536,1/1/18,37673253,Roxanna,"Kate was a fantastic host. Very pleasant and accommodating when we had to change our arrival time. The space was cozy, perfect for two people. Kate kept to the front room but was available when needed. The location is close to everything and within walking distance of times square and the theater district. I will definitely be staying again if available on my next overnight visit in the city. There are stairs... But if you don't mind walking a few floors it's great."
5441,227849382,16/1/18,1260308,Michael,"Kate is very easy to communicate with, both in person and by text message.
Her breakfasts are generous.  Her location is superb.  Building is very quiet.
This is our third visit."
5441,234071421,11/2/18,70483708,Inna,"For me it was the best choice - to stay with Kate hospitality. Firstly, the location is very excellent for traveling. In walk distance almost all the places that you would like to visit in New York. For example, 2 minutes and you are in the Time Square, 7 minutes walking and you are in Central Park, you are practically next to all theaters, cafes and restaurants. If you want to use the subway - it's 2 blocks from the accommodation. The area is calm for such a twenty-four-hour active place in the metropolis. I traveled alone and felt myself in safety. The apartment is perfectly clean and everything is convenient for relaxing after a busy days. Kate is not only a wonderful and interesting person, she was friendly, hospitable and helped with information about the city. It was my first visit to New York, where I had meeting with my friends and tried to see this legendary metropolis in a very short time and to feel its atmosphere. It's happened and I was happy and because of my choice to stay for rest with Kate's place. Highly recommended !

Для меня это было лучшим выбором - остановиться у Кэйт. Во-первых, расположение очень отличное для путешествия. В пешеходной доступности практически все места, которые вы бы желали посетить в Нью Йорке. Например, 2 минуты и вы на Тайм сквере, 7 минут легким прогулочным шагом и вы в Центральном Парке, вы практически рядом со всеми театрами, кафе и ресторанами. Если хотите воспользоваться метро - это 2 блока от жилья. Район спокойный для такого круглосуточно активного места в мегаполисе. Я путешествовала одна и чувтсвовала себя в безопсности. В квартире идеальная чистота и все удобно для отдыха после насыщенных прогулок. Кэйт не только замечательный и интересный человек, но она была доброжелательна, гостеприимна и помогала с информацией по городу. Это был мой первый визит в Нью Йорк, где я встречалась с друзьями, пыталась увидеть за очень короткое время этот легендарный мегаполис и почувствовать его атмосферу. Думаю, что мне это удалось и в том числе, благодаря выбору в качестве места для отдыха квартиры Кэйт. Очень рекомендую."
5441,246562284,25/3/18,134941891,Alessandro,The apartment was well located. The room was small but cozy and comfortable. Kate was very helpful and provided us with precise instructions.
5441,249014158,1/4/18,137974082,선경,"Kate is an awesome host. She is funny and very veeeeery friendly. The house is very close to time square and the room is cozy and has eveyrthing u need. Also kate has eveyrthing prepared. Like breakfast or information about ny or morning coffee. Ask her, she will try her best to get u wht u need. I enjoyed my stay and hope to see her again in new york!"
5441,251263481,7/4/18,27057738,Patton,Kate was AMAZING!  We had issues with our airline on our way to NYC and Kate was accommodating and easy to work with.  Once we arrived in the city she gave us great advice / tips on how to make the most of our days in the city.  Her place is in a awesome location within walking distance from Times Square.  Staying with Kate was staying with a family member rather than a stranger.
5441,253468425,14/4/18,157828450,Sarah,Kate was a wonderful host and very helpful with subway navigation!
5441,262046868,7/5/18,44272587,Fleur,"Kate is a wonderful host. Goes above and beyond to make you feel comfortable in her home and in New York. Location is perfect as well. Bedroom is quiet, especially for central location. We loved the air conditioning and ceiling fan in bedroom as it was very hot in New York during our visit. She lets you use the kitchen and even provides bagels coffee and tea for breakfast! If you have the chance definately stay with Kate."
5441,264271271,13/5/18,115737744,Benjamin,Kate was a wonderful host. Her place is located in a great location near Times Square but you'd never know that by being inside your room as it's perfectly quiet. The room was very clean and Kate's directions made it easy to find my way from the airport. I would gladly stay here again.
5441,268680432,25/5/18,177570191,Maiya,Great stay! Very well located and Kate is super hospitable and welcoming.
5441,271855399,2/6/18,809864,Andrew,"Kate is a brilliant host, very welcoming and extremely knowledgable and helpful. The room was perfect for our short stay and the location was perfect - I couldn't believe it was so close to Times Square... (I've still got a lot to learn about Manhattan). Thank you!!!"
5441,275166465,10/6/18,190622839,Eduard Julian,Kate was an amazing host! Perfect location if you want to explore New York as a tourist as Times Square is right outside her doorstep. We mainly stayed there to just sleep and explore New York during the day and evening and Kate even gave the best tips for food (ask her about the buttermilk chicken). But she also gave us an insight and a peek into the past of how New York City came to be which adds another dimension of experience when exploring the city.
5441,278165884,17/6/18,171478266,Mijail,Es un lugar que ofrece buen servicio en una zona increíble. Nos gusto mucho 
5441,279758836,21/6/18,182384713,Jake,We loved our stay. Kate was great! My wife and I wanted a place to stay in close proximity to the Broadway shows we were attending and the location was great. Kate was very friendly and provided us with a bunch of useful info on public transport and stuff to do in the city. Would definitely recommend!
5441,283354188,29/6/18,183156061,Courtney,"We had such a pleasant stay in Kate’s adorable apartment. Kate was helpful in giving us advice on how to get around the city and accommodating to our needs to make us comfortable for our trip. She is a joy to stay with, and we would book with her again when we need our Broadway fix!"
5441,289519541,12/7/18,72210692,Clarissa,"Kate’s place is in an awesome location - we were able to walk to lots of great places and the subway was easy to access for the destinations that weren’t quite walkable. It is easy walking distance to Broadway shows and Times Square. 
Kate is very friendly and helpful. She has lots of great advice about navigating the city, which we really appreciated as first-timers in NYC!
Her apartment doesn’t seem to have central AC but she has a window unit in the bedroom, so it’s still comfortable for sleeping in the summer.
We had a great visit and would recommend her place to anyone who wants to be close to all the Manhattan must-see activities!"
5441,291209343,15/7/18,12536445,Madison,Kate and her place are awesome. The location and hospitality make you feel welcome and provide a great NYC experience.
5441,294825409,22/7/18,21406416,Lilian,"This is a cozy, convenient apartment in a great location that met or exceeded all our needs. Kate was great at communicating with us despite being out of town; check in instructions were clear, and she left us bagels and tea/coffee, which ended up being great while it was raining. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend."
5441,297923220,28/7/18,184702482,Jake,"I find it hard to boil this down to 1 rating - so I've broken it up as follows:
- 5/5 location (walk to lots of stuff!)
- 5/5 host (Kate was friendly and offered tons of support with transportation info)
- 4/5 cleanliness (sanitary, but not “spotless” and shared spaces were cluttered)
- 5/5 safety
- 1/5 bed quality (super super uncomfortable, especially for 2 people: we lost hours of sleep). 
- Also, the arrangement is a bit awkward: The apartment has 1 bedroom, which you get, while Kate uses the living room as her space (though she slept elsewhere on both nights of our stay). I know that sharing a space is part of the AirBNB experience, but this setup could make it harder to feel comfortable if she was there sleeping in the living room."
5441,304456564,9/8/18,203851138,Alan,Great location. We had Kate’s entire apartment for our stay. Kate was very helpful and allowed us to store our luggage on our last day. 
5803,1743,23/4/09,9868,Pamela,"Artwork, indeed! The walls are covered with drawings by Maurice Sendak, Steven Kellogg, among others. It was quiet. Breakfast was ample. Batman and Robin were very affectionate. We plan to return again. Thanks, Laurie!"
5803,2767,17/5/09,16345,Jocelyne,"Great place to stay - lovely home, lovely hosts and great neighbourhood - glad we got to spend some time in Brooklyn"
5803,3549,3/6/09,19091,Cam,"Great place, great garden, friendly cats and nice host. "
5803,5554,14/7/09,24880,Muriel,Booked this on behalf of my daughter so didnt stay there myself. My daughter confirmed the house was not as clean as expected but Laurie was in the middle of having some work done on the house. Only stayed for two of the four nights booked as circumstances changed.  Lauried very kindly gave refund for one of the nights not used.
5803,5840,20/7/09,17112,Marcel & Seda,"It was the first time we used BB and not the last...for my daughter seda and me,it was ideal to live in laurie's typical brooklyn house during 10 day's. We recieved interessting informations about cultural happenings and practical things. Laurie is a friendly open person.
her house is locatet in a charming part of brooklyn and very close to a metrostation.. "
5803,10217,15/9/09,27507,Angelo,"We enjoyed a lot our stay with Laurie. Great and qiet house with its  garden and  two lovely cats. Laurie was  helpful, gave us good and interesting advices, and permitted us to discover another view of Brooklyn. Thanks Laurie!  "
5803,11515,27/9/09,24309,Dieter,"There are some beers in the fridge said Laurie at the end of our phone call. This is a sentence one might expect when calling home. And not of a stranger calling from Manhattan to Brooklyn to state the time of arrival.
I'd rather not use the hackneyed phrase. A home away from home.
But I will anyhow. Laurie's little house in a ""Starbuck-free-zone"" in Park Slope Brooklyn. An area just like a cliché-laden European would imagine. Her house, full of books,  pictures. The splendid guest room. Most impressive of all, however is Laurie and her son, Peter. Generous, friendly and helpful. Laurie gave me some good tips. E.g. BAM, Barke-Music, Gospel concert. And when I come back to Brooklyn again, I know there will be a beer for me in the fridge.

Dieter, D. Germany"
5803,12441,4/10/09,40215,Jean-Claude,"We stayed only a few days but it was above our expectations. Laurie is a great Host and a gold mine of infos about Brooklyn and NYC also. Her place is quiet, clean and well located. We strongly recommend it, you'll feel a little a bit like home. 
Laurie we got a super deal for a brand new Krups' toaster-oven at 80$ at Richards.
Best regards to you and Peter.
Jean-Claude and Suzelle from Montreal."
5803,12761,7/10/09,39686,Colin,"Laurie was a very gracious hostess and we felt right at home.  She is very knowledgable about the local community and the city overall and full of good ideas about activities in the area.  The house itself is beautiful and clean with two friendly cats and of course Peter too.  The location is great, close to Manhattan but walking distance to good bars and restaurants in Brooklyn too.  We wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.  Thank you! "
5803,12963,10/10/09,26468,German,"WHAT CAN I SAY...
LAURIE IS AN EXCELLENT HOSTESS...
THE HOUSE I S VERY WELL LOCATED,,,,
EVERY THING SEEMS TO BE CLOSE... 
THE HOUSE IS REALLY BEAUTIFULL...

SHE AND PETER WERE SUPER KIND AND HELPFULL...
WE REALLY FELT AT HOME...AND WERE SORRY FOR SUCHA SHORT STAY...
SURE WOULD RECOMEND IT TO EVERY BODY.. AND WOULD LIKE TO RETURN...
SHE MADE OUR SHORT STAY... PRECIOUS.."
5803,15590,30/10/09,40175,Linda,My husband and I had a wonderful time with Laurie and another guest at her welcoming home.  We were thrilled with the location - only blocks from our daughter and close to the train!  Spending time chatting with Laurie and her family in her warm living area enhanced our trip.
5803,16200,4/11/09,39478,Natalia,"Dear Laurie, thank you so much again for amazing time in NY! We are deeply in love with warm atmosphere in your home, our room was perfect, cosy and great comfortable beds!!! Great location near Subway, 15 min to Manhatten!! We really felt like home, and can't imagine better place to stay next time!!:) Hope to come back soon! Natalia"
5803,17037,12/11/09,42873,Janet,"A huge thank you to Laurie for 'being there' with so much advice and info on local restaurants, places to visit and for welcoming my daughter Rebecca too (she lives in NY). We felt so relaxed and comfortable it was like being at home. The house is a dream and an inspiration in Art and Style. We will be back and have all ready recommended it to our friends. Janet & Les Ross."
5803,17493,16/11/09,47703,Marjan,Laurie is a great hostess who loves to share her beautiful home.  She makes great coffee and offers wonderful pastry for breakfast while sharing her discount tickets for broadway shows.  
5803,18822,30/11/09,48655,Patricia,"Laurie's available room was simple, clean and comfortable. She is a hostess who knows Brooklyn and how to get around. I enjoyed my stay although breakfast was lacking. "
5803,20258,14/12/09,14794,Vesna,"Thanks so much for a memorable Brooklyn experience, Laurie and Peter.  The bed was super comfortable and everything you could possibly need was provided.  The house is located in a quiet street which was a nice contrast to the crowds and ambience of Manhattan.  Park Slope is home to so many great restaurants and live music venues which Laurie recommended--her knowledge and passion for the local area was clearly obvious, and she was keen to make sure you got the best out of her neighborhood.  You'll immediately feel right at home.  "
5803,22750,3/1/10,39018,Alfredo,Thanks for everything Laurie. You have a lovely home. The shops on 5th Avenue are conveniently nearby & the subway lines are just a few steps away. Our room was homey & the bed was comfy.
5803,24309,18/1/10,39478,Natalia,"It was the second time when we stayed at Laurie’s place, and again it was so warm and cosy, wonderful soft beds, quiet district, great spacious bathroom,  we even didn’t want to go out of home!:) We really felt so relaxed and comfortable like we were at home!   
Laurie was as always very helpful and kind! 
The location is perfect, it is great, that the Subway was very close, Manhattan is just 10 minutes by Subway. It’s so warm and comfortable that we just love this place more and more!:) THANK YOU!!!!
"
5803,24899,26/1/10,69884,Jeri,"This was the first time I ever tried this kind of accommodation, and what a pleasant experience it was. Laurie's home is beautiful and spacious. It makes you feel like you are a resident of New York, instead of a Visitor. I came to Brooklyn for a week long Workshop. The close access to the Subway, and minutes away from Manhattan was extremely convenient. I loved my room and the internet access was great. The bed was comfy and the room charming. It is a nice, quiet and safe neighborhood. I plan to come back for another Workshop this year, and I will stay with Laurie again if my room is available. Her 2 cats, Batman and Robin are adorable."
5803,26330,15/2/10,38718,Donna,"We loved Laurie and her home! It was our first time using Airbnb and we were thrilled to find such an amazing place. Laurie's house is truly filled with art, color and light. Park Slope is fantastic and I will always stay there when I go to NY. Laurie and Peter are welcoming and...Laurie's breakfast is perfect!The pictures really can't tell you how amazing her home is. The rooms and beds are cozy, clean and confortable as is the bathroom. Batman and Robin are the sweetest kitties. We love them. I would recommend Laurie's bandb again and again. I hope to go back and to bring friends and family as well. FIVE STARS all the way! "
5803,28808,9/3/10,62312,Alita,"Staying at Laurie's house was a real treat!!! We had an awesome time; it was so nice to come home to a real home every night!  Like everyone else has said; everything was clean, the beds were comfy; the breakfast was delicious; the cats were hilarious; and I would ad that Laurie's welcoming nature & willingness to share her wealth of NY knowledge with her guests was a HUGE blessing as well.  Staying with Laurie & Peter (and Batman & Robin!) made our NY experience awesome!  Thanks so much!!"
5803,31268,25/3/10,70464,Gabby,"We stayed at Laurie's place in Brooklyn for 6 nights while on our US trip. Laurie is the perfect host - she even had our baby at east within seconds of meeting her. You can grab breakfast (bagels and OJ, yum!) before leaving and her place is a short subway ride from Manhattan. Thank you again for the stay Laurie, it made our NY experience even richer.

Gabby, Mench and Julian"
5803,33160,4/4/10,68299,Andy,"We had a great time staying at Laurie's house. It was really quiet and comfortable for sleeping, easy to get to, and Laurie was really helpful with her advice. We also enjoyed the illustration artwork and books and getting to know Laurie's neighbors and neighborhood. This was my first time using Airbnb and it all went seamlessly! I hope we can stay with Laurie again on a future trip to NYC."
5803,70400,29/7/10,86041,Alexandre,"Le séjour passé chez Laurie Kellogg  fut vraiment très agréable. Laurie est charmante, attentionnée et s'occupe très bien de ses hôtes. Les chambres sont très confortables, spacieuses, bien décorées, avec une touche très personnelle qui donne cette impression d'être chez soi. Le petit déjeuner, pris dans le salon principal est toujours très copieux et bien équilibré (à volonté, bagles &cream cheese, fruits, céréales, jus d'orange bio, lait, etc...); Après avoir marché pendant des heures dans NY, nous avions accès à la cusine pour préparer un repas, et ensuite nous prélasser dans le salon. Le quartier est particulièrement attrayant à quelques minutes de Prospect park (profiter de la fraicheur du matin pour aller faire un petit jogging) des rues calmes, des restos sympas, des clubs de musique, et beaucoup d'infos de la part de Laurie pour que le séjour laisse un souvenir inoubliable.
Last but not least, nous n'avons pas eu de surprises désagréables par rapport à ce que nous avions espéré en voyant le site de Laurie sur Air B&B, et nous recommandons cette adresse les yeux fermés."
5803,73964,5/8/10,106834,Sarah,"This was our very first time with AirBnB and we loved it. Laurie's place is really comfortable, nice and quiet, with a real warm and friendly atmosphere; we definitely felt like being at home. Laurie has been really helpful, with lot of tips about places to go and restaurants to dine in the neighbourhood; her house is within easy reach from the nearest metro station, and just a few subway stops from Manhattan. Laurie is an open-minded, talkative nice woman, we really loved chatting with her and we would have had more time to spend with her. Hope to come back soon!"
5803,77737,13/8/10,155330,Mary Ellen,"We had a wonderful time in Brooklyn with Laurie (Peter was away at camp).  We had the top floor to ourselves during most of our week-long stay.  Laurie provided plenty of ideas of things to do.  The location was ideal.  We walked down to the DUMBO area a couple of times, easily took the subway into Manhattan, and attended an outdoor concert in Brooklyn's Prospect Park, which we would not have learned about had we been in a hotel.  There are numerous restaurants nearby, both eat-in and take out, as well as several grocery stores/delis.  We ate many meals in the park, enjoying the warm weather.  Laurie was very generous with the use of her computers, which was very helpful in allowing my daughter to keep up with her friends on (Hidden by Airbnb) , and even to connect up with them in New York.    We would definitely contact Laurie again if visiting New York."
5803,79945,17/8/10,86923,Tecla,"We spent wonderful days thanks in her lovely home, we felt very
well the rooms were comfortable as the whole house. We appreciate a lot
the warm athmosfere that she created, she also helped us with
suggestions, buying tickes for us and so on.
New York City is wonderful
and Laurie helped us to live it in the best way.Thank you a lot!

Abbiamo trascorso dei giorni meravigliosi nella sua bellissima casa. Ci
siamo sentiti accolti stupendamente, le camere erano confortevoli come
tutta la casa. Abbiamo apprezzato tantissimo la calda atmosfera che ha
creato, ci ha inoltre aiutato tanto con suggerimenti, acquisto
biglietti e tanti utili consigli. New York è una città meravigliosa e
Laurie ci ha aiutato a viverla nel modo migliore. Grazie davvero!"
5803,92957,8/9/10,103157,Jennifer,"My 79-year-old parents recently stayed at Laurie's for a few weeks (with a break to go to DC for 3 nights, during which their luggage was graciously stored) and they loved the place. They were in New York to visit grandchildren in Park Slope, and the house is conveniently situated near bus and subway lines. It was very clean, homely and Laurie was most obliging and welcoming, providing anything they desired (Weetabix, bedside lamps, fruit salad!) upon request."
5803,97406,15/9/10,118654,Pauline,We enjoyed our stay with Laurie and Peter. Great location. Laurie was very welcoming and we felt at home straight away. She gave great help on visiting the area. There were a couple of samll things that needed fixing like the front door and the bedroom door which does not shut easily but I'm sure Laurie is on to it! Thanks L
5803,100717,20/9/10,119700,Heather,"What a find... we had a great stay with Laurie.  What a gem... would never hesitate to recommend  her to any one.  What a place, what a deal and what a site... Thanks to airbnb I was able to enjoy Brooklyn and Manhattan.  Her house is so close to the sub way, but Brooklyn is a must see place too.  Thank you soo  much!  Your son and cats just add to the experience.  The Australia couple are now friends.  I will be back.  Heather"
5803,113397,7/10/10,184042,John And Nathan,We stayed 5 nights in Laurie and Peter's home and cam't imagine a more comfortable accommodation in Brooklyn.  Laurie is quite involved in her community and she loves Brooklyn.  She took us to Red Hook to me some of her artist friends and gave us a bit of a tour around the area.  She obviously loves her neighborhood.  I would recommend this home to anyone.  Thanks Laurie and Peter.
5803,120645,17/10/10,230418,Tatiana,"It was my first time to use such kind of accommodation instead of hotels and I liked it very much. Laurie's house is amazing, the room is cozy and quiet, the bed is comfortable, everything is very clean and has really warm atmosphere, breakfast is very good and the cats are sweet. The location is very quiet and convenient, 5 minutes walking to subway - and in 15-20 min you are in Manhattan! NYC is great, worth visiting again and again, and Park Slope is the best place to stay. Laurie is a great host, very helpful, very clever and with good sence of humor. I enjoyed my staying with Laurie and definitely will come back.
Highly recommended to everybody."
5803,123567,20/10/10,244529,Angela,"Laurie was so kind, and an excellent host! She made us feel entirely welcome in her beautiful home. Clean, cozy, super-convenient location in a nice neighborhood. Plus, an impressive library of children's books:)  Would love to stay there again.  Thank you so much, Laurie!!"
5803,140272,16/11/10,254645,Jacqueline,"Staying with Laurie and Peter was an absolutely wonderful experience. I felt like it was a second home. The room had great morning light, the house is peppered with beautiful illustrations and there are books galore. What more could you ask for?! I felt so welcome and taken care of by way of recommendations for restaurants, cool places to see and things to do.  I would one-hundred percent recommend staying with them. I can honestly say that I not only had a great time but I have  made two wonderful friends. Thank you so much Peter & Laurie! :-)

Laurie ed il figlio sono davvero ospitali (Batman e Robin due micioni in cerca di coccole), la casa e' a completa disposizione dell'ospite... il frigo e' sempre ben rifornito di succhi, latte e quant'altro possa necessitare per una buona abbondante colazione. Si raggiunge il centro di Manhattan in circa 25 min di metro, la fermata piu vicina alla casa di Laurie dista appena 5 minuti a piedi. in definitiva l'esperienza a casa di Laurie e' stata sicuramente positiva.

She told us a lot about the places to visit and to eat at (really good ones) and what to do during our stay. Oh, and there are s (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) charming cats) 
The room was clean and warm, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom right by side had everything u need.
Next time in new york i'll stau there for sure :)
p.s. the house is really that beautiful as in pictures)   "
5803,167205,7/1/11,65937,Alessio&Claudia,"We had a fantastic time at Laurie's. The house is beautiful, the cats adorable and the room very cozy and comfortable. Laurie herself is a wonderful person, as well as a great source of information: her knowledge of Brooklyn and NYC in general is impressive! Also, the house's location itself is very convenient, be it for the subway station or just shops and good restaurants. We strongly recommend staying here - it is well worth it - and we're sure you'll enjoy it as much as we have."
5803,192963,6/3/11,121530,Elizabeth,"Laurie is a warm and generous host .  Her recommendations of restaurants in the neighborhood  have been memorable. Her home in the South Slopes shows many original and personal artwork, and lots of children's books.  It is within easy walking access to the subway."
5803,201394,17/3/11,374347,Jessica,"Laurie was a great host! She was very friendly and very helpful with dining and entertainment recommendations, even offering groupons for us to use! It was nice of her to have breakfast items available. The room was spacious and the location was great for exploring Brooklyn as well as Manhattan (very close to the F/G/R trains). This was my first airbnb experience and it was definitely a good one!"
5803,213942,31/3/11,103074,Paul,"Laurie is a generous host who imparts info about Park Slope restaurants, provides terrific bagels and orange juice, cereal, etc. and shares her wonderful, spacious home with interesting travelers who get to know one another. Her quiet neighborhood in Brooklyn is ideal for exploring Prospect Park, 7th Avenue hotspots, and close to subways for getting to Manhattan in a short time. Check out the TKTS site at the Jay Street/Metrotech stop to get 50% off Broadway tickets. Much less crowded than the Times Square location. I also recommend trying the Moutarde Bistro at 239 5th Ave about a mile north of Laurie's for a great French meal at reasonable prices. All in all, a great place to stay."
5803,217829,5/4/11,309052,Maggie,"nice rooms,  clean, warm and cosy.   Nice Bathroom with very hot shower.   top floor,  could be difficult stairs for elderley to negotiate."
5803,226966,15/4/11,414799,Linde,"It certainly was lovely to stay in Laurie's house. Staying in Brooklin was no disadvantage at all, quite quickly to Manhattan by subway and having the oppotunity to see sites in Brookling we would not have seen otherwise. Laurie is a wonderful hostess, very helpful, interested in art and very educated too.
Nearby are a few really nice restaurants, which we eventually preferred to places in Manhattan, cheaper and good quality.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

5803,231971,19/4/11,464017,Joannes,"My daughter and I stayed in Laurie's house for a few nights. It was quite perfect. an. Extremely well-organized (Website hidden by Airbnb) a quiet neighbourhood, close to the F train, straight into Manhattan."

We were sad not to meet Laurie and Peter, but enjoyed staying with a lovely Swiss couple in the house. Thanks to Laurie for all the extra tips and finishing touches she added to the experience! Definitely recommend to others."
5803,256119,9/5/11,218566,Lisa,"Laurie was a wealth of information and offered many great tips about Brooklyn and New York. My daughter and I enjoyed staying in her cosy home, and walking the neighborhood.  By the time we left, we felt like locals using the subway and enjoying all that the city has to offer. We'd definitely recommend a stay at Laurie's in Brooklyn, as both a way to stretch your travel dollar and also as having a fabulous location to explore. 

Being in Brooklyn didn't prevent us from attending theatre in New York, going to museums or visiting Central Park.
"
5803,280884,25/5/11,529835,Micki,"Laurie is a great host. Tons of maps, books and information available for her guests to help plan their NYC trips. Also, her location in brooklyn is fabulous--walking distance to5th and 7th avenues in brooklyn where lots of cool indie shops and cafes are located and only a few blocks tot he metro to get into manhattan. Loved her croissants in the morning. "
5803,290690,31/5/11,134005,Jill,"Laurie is an awesome hostess: great breakfast carbs with espresso; lots of suggestions on places to go and things to do; and the best English-style garden I've seen lately.  Clearly posted instructions available for things like tricky doors, cats, coffee machine & so forth -- all intended to help you be the good guest she deserves.  I'll be back!"
5803,299539,6/6/11,480295,Andy,"Staying with Laurie was fantastic.  We felt so at home.  Laurie makes you feel really relaxed, the house is lovely, the cats (Batman and Robin) are cute and we slept so well.  Laurie gave us lots of ideas about where to eat and things to do.  Breakfast was lovely with great products.  We want to go back to New York because it's a great city but also because we want to stay with Laurie.  We don't hesitate to recommend her to you!  Also, Park Slope is a great area and you are so quick to get to manhattan.  One of the best b and bs we have ever stayed in.  Thank you!  "
5803,321117,18/6/11,488247,Ephraim,"Our stay at Laurie's is probably the best experience one could ever imagine through Airbnb.  Laurie is an amazing host, a knowledgeable tour guide of New York, and a museum curator all in one.  Her home is in a great part of the city, yet on a side street where I never had a problem parking just a few feet from her front door.  Her house could be a Better Homes and Garden showpiece, and yes, it even has a large garden in her back yard.  There is artwork and books everywhere.  In fact, the photos on Airbnb don't even do justice to the beauty of the place.  The rooms are large, immaculate, and the beds are comfortable.  The espresso maker in the kitchen and fresh croissants and OJ every morning was a treat, and much better than even Starbucks can deliver!  The house management team, Batman and Robin (Laurie's two cats), were friendly and ever-present.  I couldn't think of a nicer place to stay.  "
5803,343871,30/6/11,573441,Marjan,"hello,
just to let you know that we stayed at Lauries place and that was a great experience! 
she's a wonderful host, and we had a very good time.  
Laurie helped us to figure out what we should see and do in Ny and her house was a place of rest and safety when we came back from the hectic NYC :-)
Brooklyn is beautiful too and only about 10 min. with the metro to the city centre.
If we ever go back to NYC, we'll ask Laurie to stay at her home again, her house felt like home the moment we came there! 
Also Lauries son Peter was a perfect host, nice boy!!! 
We sent them our love because they helped to make our vacation feel like one great gift!!

 I highly recommend to book with her,.
 Park Slope it´s really a safe place to be and a very nice neighbourhood to know!
Something else  , I left NY very late at night and Laurie allowed me to leave my baggage at her house until the time I took the cab !!!!! That was a very sensitive attitude and I really appreciated it ( and she did it even though her new guests were already arrived !!!"
5803,712941,13/11/11,865820,Janet,"We had a great time at Laurie and Peter's house. We were made to feel really welcome with our young daughter and Laurie went out of her way to share tips and ideas for places to visit. Our room was really comfortable and it was great to be surrounded by such fantastic art. It was really useful  to have access to lots of maps, magazines and information about New York, and we really enjoyed our chats with Laurie- it was great to meet someone so passionate about her city.The neighbourhood is fantastic- we ended up enjoying Brooklyn so much that we spent most of our time exploring the local area. We really appreciated the hospitality which we received and we are delighted that it made Tove's first trip to NYC so special. Thank you- and we hope it is not long before we return. "

Being in Laurie's Home is to be surrounded by art work and books. Her warmth makes you feel right at home. "

She is very hospitable & knowledgeable

The house is beautiful & the bedrooms are extremely comfortable.

The subway is just five minutes walk with trains to Manhattan every few minutes.
Brooklyn  itself is great to walk around with lots of good food & quirky shops.
Went to a small music club round the corner (Barbes) and saw Nora Jones performing also a fantastic Mandingo embassadors - guinean band. Top stuff!"
5803,803752,24/12/11,1445183,Pradeep,"My partner and I stayed with Laurie for 5 days right before Christmas, and we couldn't imagine a better choice for our New York visit. The house is located in a wonderful, safe and pedestrian-friendly neighbourhood in Brooklyn -- with a great choice of restaurants, cafes and bars, all within short walking distance. There are also two easily accessible subway stations nearby for getting around the city. As a result, we had no problems efficiently getting around Brooklyn and Manhattan from this location.  

Laurie herself was an excellent host, and a fantastic source of information for where to go for dining and entertainment, as well as for  getting around New York and Brooklyn. She also appeared to know quite a bit about the historical and cultural side of the city. (One of my regrets was not getting enough time to talk to her about this side of the city)  

The house itself is a walk-up with beautiful spacious interior (the photos on the website don't exaggerate). The house is filled with a wonderful array of art -- in fact, one of my daily pleasures was lingering over the drawings and paintings as I walked up and down the stairs in the morning. 

The room we had was cozy, warm and private, and the bathroom was clean and maintained throughout our stay. In short, we couldn't hoped for a safer, more well-kept place for our visit. 

My partner and I were surprised as to how much we lucked out finding this place for our New York trip, given that this was the first time we had used Airbnb.  We intend on coming back here again when we visit N.Y. next time.

"
5803,823066,2/1/12,1353997,Margherita,"I've been in NY for New Year Eve with my boyfriend. Our stay was perfect, Laurie's place is just next to the metro wich is fine if you want to visit Manhattan, but is also a cosy place to come back to after an intense day in the city. The room and the breakfast were fine, and Laurie has been a very good host explaining us how to move with public transportation. We had also the opportunity to experience the everyday life of Brooklyn wich is something more than just being tourists in Manhattan. And if you love cats you should meet Batman and Robin!"
5803,865304,16/1/12,898248,Patrick,"I had a most enjoyable stay.  The building is close to public transportation and a short walk to several great bars and restaurants.  The Fifth Estate was the best  with live entertainment every night. The hostess always had coffee, juice and snacks available.  The two resident cats added great enjoyment to my visit.  Highly recommended.

5803,929166,18/2/12,1697910,Rosemary,"If I could give Laurie more than five stars, I would.  My family will be eternally grateful for her amazing warm hospitality to my daughter Dana  who needed a place to stay for two weeks between apartment changes. I'm  writing the review since Dana is in move- in mode today, but she could not have been more thrilled with her stay. We  met Laurie after a six hour drive from upstate to assist in the apartment search, and she was kind and lovely. This was my first introduction to airbnb, and find it hard to believe you will find any nicer stay than this one!!! Amazing area, lovely and clean house....but mostly, just a warm feeling environment. 
Thank you Laurie."
5803,989018,11/3/12,281328,Adrienne,"Laurie and her comfy home were a perfect place for me while working in Brooklyn.  The accommodations were quiet, homey, and clean, she always offered help regarding things to do and places to dine and there were 2 super duper sweet kitties to round out the experience.  :)
So enjoy!

5803,1033802,23/3/12,1619346,Lisa,"My wife  Pat and I had a 10 day stay in March and it was a most enjoyable experience. The house is remarkably 'homely' and conveniently placed in Park Slope to  great shops, restaurants, amenities and services. Laurie is a superb host helpful, attentive and  and very kind. The house has style and is very  comfortable but with some stairs  to climb that need good legs. But the effort is more than made up for by the pleasant surprises in store for the European visitor in particular, and the engaging conversations  to be had with Laurie and her brother Colin. Warmly recommended!
--Manlio 

This was such an incredibly lucky find.  A large old house full of charm, very comfortable and the bed was like drifting on a cloud - seriously!
This old world experience included the wonderful hospitality and friendliness of Laurie (the B&B owner and host) who is a veritable mine of information regarding places to go, how to get there and much time is saved by recommending places to eat. Talking of food, oh those almond croissants!  Many thanks to you and your son for a great stay. Your two lovely cats, Batman and Robin, also made us feel very much at home! We will definitely be back Laurie.

5803,1098004,8/4/12,1757068,Mel,"Laurie was just brilliant. It felt like staying with an old friend. Laurie is so very helpful and caring about what she does. Her hospitality started way before my friend and I arrived with her friendly emails, giving us advice about how best to travel to her home from the airport, and about money off vouchers for bike rental in Central Park. We arrived at her home really late, and Laurie and her brother Colin were there to welcome us with a glass of wine, and Colin even took our huge cases up the stairs. Laurie lent my friend a coat whilst we were staying- as it was colder than we had expected. I visited New York partly as a tourist, but also to visit my daughter who is studying over there. Laurie was so kind in allowing my daughter to stay over one night. We slept in Peters room, which was great. That meant so much to me as it meant my daughter and I could be together late at night. Staying in Peter's room also meant that it was ok for Robin and Batman- Laurie's lovely cats- to snuggle up with me, just like my cat at home does. However, it was also no problem to keep the cats out of our room if we wanted to.
My friend and I shared the room on the top floor which was a lovely light room at the front of the house and shared the bathroom with Colin- which was never a problem. The bed was comfy, and Laurie provided towels, boxes of tissues- and there was even a hairdryer. The shower was just great. 
One morning Laurie cooked us breakfast- and again it was just like being a friend sitting up at the breakfast bar watching her cook bacon and French toast. Other mornings we chose to wander up the road, as we found a little local cafe that we enjoyed going to. The area was perfect after hectic days out walking in the city- we often came back quite late, and it always seemed safe, quiet and calm.
I would have no hesitation in recommending a stay with Laurie. Much more friendly than staying in an impersonal hotel room. I hope that I will return, and also hope that I keep in contact with Laurie. Both Laurie and Colin have a great sense of humour.
Two regrets- that we didnt go to the bar on Sunday night to listen to music- we were too tired.- And that I didnt take any photos of Laurie, Colin and her cats.-Oh!! and a third regret!! We didnt really get to know Laurie's son Peter- he wasnt around much."
5803,1154173,20/4/12,1642299,Julian,"Laurie is a great host and her house is lovely. We have stayed in Manhattan for all our previous visits to New York, so it was a new and refreshing experience to hear birds singing when waking up in the mornings!

Park Slope is a really nice area and Laurie's house is just off 5th Ave which has plenty of nice places to eat and drink. It is close to 2 subway stops that give you easy access to other areas of Brooklyn, plus Manhattan and Queens. (About 20 minutes from Lower Manhattan). 

The breakfast was good too - Laurie put on breads, croissants and jams, plus a coffee maker and made it clear that you are to make yourself at home. 

The rate as extremely reasonable and allowed us to spend more time in New York than we could if we had stayed solely in Manhattan. 

I would definitely stay here again and would recommend"
5803,1174610,24/4/12,21005,David,"We've just returned from another stay with Laurie in Park Slope. This was our third visit in all but the first since 2009 and it felt like returning home! Laurie's place is the perfect retreat in the big city - quiet, comfortable and homey, we'd never consider staying anywhere else.  As always Laurie was the perfect host - armed with a wealth of information on restaurants, museums and other activities to keep us busy. In fact, more like a friend that a host, conversation was always interesting and fun. The bagels and croissants provided each morning were the perfect start to the day, not to mention the excellent coffee. It was also great to see the adorable resident cats - Batman and Robin - once again. The neighbourhood has changed a little since our last visit but only in a positive way - there are now even more fantastic restaurants and bars to try out and many are right on the doorstep. Park Slope really is the perfect base to sample all of what Brooklyn has to offer and apparently there is a small island called Manhattan not too far away if you run out of things to do! "

Within such a short time I felt I had made a new friend and knew I would be welcomed back in the future. Thanks again Laurie for your gracious hospitality. All the best to you always. Cheryl"

The house is beautiful and welcoming (and so is the lovely garden/ backyard). We stayed in the room with the two twin beds and we shared a bathroom with another guest, which worked out very well. 
Laurie was a very welcoming and helpful host who provided us with lots of insider tips, maps, vouchers, and just very useful information on what to do, where to go, and how to save money on Broadway tickets, etc. 
Not only were we delighted by the house and our host, we can also recommend this place because of its great location. Park Slope is a very lively neighborhood with a variety of restaurants, bars, cafés, small  shops, trees and beautiful houses. Last but not least, this place can be easily reached by subway and we never felt unsafe walking home (""away  from home""). "

We are a family of four (two adults and two children) and needed to stay in this neighborhood so were very happy to find this place. When we got there we were made very welcome. The rooms are a good size and it was great to have our own bathroom (which also has a washing machine and dryer which we used once). Breakfasts were delicious--fruit, croissants, bagels, cereal etc. The house is close to lots of great restaurants and shops, and Laurie provides lots of information about things to do, including maps, menus, and recommendations for exhibitions.

I recommend her home for everyone who wants more than just a place to sleep while visiting New York city, but a house full of art, who offers a real experience of life."
5803,7078969,5/9/13,1490706,Noel,"Laurie's place was perfect for my stay - I was visiting my young daughter who lives in Park Slope, and Laurie's house is at the dead centre of the neighbourhood, well placed for the subway and slightly south of the rather uber-trendy Slope further North.
We had, when at home, the run of the thru lounge and garden. Other people staying were great company. Well stocked fridge etc. Cats good company too...
Laurie very welcoming and easygoing and treated the three loud toddlers wandering her lounge with care and kindness.
Not ideal if you want to be alone, and unless you are in the basement flat you are sharing a bathroom, but these are minor issues and the place is great value."
5803,7766687,2/10/13,2528458,Ryan,"Park Slope is an amazing neighborhood to stay in, so much so that I moved here with my family from Ireland. We stayed with Laurie for a couple of weeks while we looked for a long term apartment and would highly recommend staying in the large bedroom which we lodged in for the last few nights of our stay with Laurie (in addition to the stay we had in the basement apartment).

There is plenty of space in the room which means you can store pltny of luggage and still have space to move around. There is also a bathroom on each floor so there was never any queues to get in!  Laurie provides a selection of great local foods for breakfast and guests have access to the backyard which was great for my young son as was the washer and dryer for laundry.
Laurie provided a wealth of helpful advice, was very easy going, friendly, welcoming and very accommodating and flexible to suit her guests which made a real difference to our stay. Laurie’s two cats are also very friendly and love meeting new people.
I would highly recommended booking a stay with Laurie if you would like to visit the area. "
5803,8134602,17/10/13,3778619,Carol,"This was my second stay at Laurie's in one of the third floor bedrooms. The bedroom overlooked her beautiful back garden, was spacious, comfortable, and quiet. My daughter lives five blocks away, so Laurie's is very convenient for me. I felt safe walking ""home"" to Laurie's in the evenings. I liked being able to enjoy coffee and breakfast each morning. Laurie always asks what kind of breakfast foods you like, and they ""magically"" show up on the table ready for you to partake of. Laurie and her son are friendly, helpful, and so accommodating. Her rates are very reasonable too! There is a well-stocked 24 hr. grocery store a half block away, and other types of stores, restaurants etc. a short distance away. I look forward to my next visit to Brooklyn and a stay at Laurie's."
5803,8279213,23/10/13,1232843,Harm,"We had a great time at Lauries beautiful Park Slope house with wonderful garden, packed with squirrels. We loved the atmosphere of both house, street and neighbourhood and thus learned a lot more about New York then the usual Manhattan, really a great experience.

Laurie was a perfect and thoughtfull host from the moment of reservation, providing lots of useful information and tips for worthwhile addresses and restaurants. Perfect was also the travel info which made us travel quickly from Park Slope to lots of interesting places in Dumbo, Williamsburg (market/shops), Meatpacking (High Line) and Harlem, and don't forget Brooklyn Museum!

Furthermore Laurie made us really feel at home with daily a perfect breakfast. We surely will be back, thanks for a lovely stay Laurie. Harm and Petra."
5803,8821994,19/11/13,2293395,Theofilos,"Although we haven't extensively used airbnb in the past, we have to admit that this was a surprisingly great experience for us.

We arrived at Laurie's around 11.30pm and not only she wasn't bothered by the late time, she also spent the next hour and a half to explain and discuss with us all the things we could do in NY.

Her information was spot on and we never regretting following her recommendations. She has a great taste for theatrical plays and is very well informed with what is going on in the town.

The place itself is located in a lovely and safe street only 3 blocks from the subway station that can take you to Manhattan in no more than 20-25 minutes. Art is overflowing in the place and Laurie is happy to explain where everything comes from.

Having an uncle who has been an F1 champion as well as an autograph from Roger Federer is always a bonus!!!

Batman and Robin (her two cats) are very well behaved and add to the great experience.

Rooms (both bedrooms and common rooms) and bathrooms were very clean and tidy.

To sum up, Laurie and her lovely place contributed in having a lovely time in NY and also saved some money during the trip.

If we ever go back to NY we wouldn't look for another place to stay !!
"
5803,9055524,3/12/13,8341565,Gulsum,"We stayed at Laurie's place for five nights. It was our first airbnb experience & really a good choice. We spent most of our time in Manhattan but had the opportunity to explore Brooklyn during the last day thanks to Laurie's suggestions. Laurie is a great host and the place is exactly the same as in the picture. Rent her place, listen to her suggestions and enjoy NYC. "
5803,9493797,31/12/13,8826277,Julie,"My daughter and I enjoyed very much staying with Laurie, she was very helpful, lots of information on what to see, transport and mad us feel very welcome in her home"
5803,11009945,17/3/14,42273,Dani,"We stayed at Laurie's place for 4 nights for a family gathering. I am a fellow Airbnb host and needed extra space for my visiting family. You will not find a more gorgeous home and friendlier atmosphere than at Laurie's place! The rooms are lovely and the beds very comfortable. The price is also so so reasonable. Park Slope is one of the nicest and most popular neighborhoods in all of NYC and there is so much to see and do right near by. However, if you want to go into Manhattan (you hardly need too!) Laurie's place is just a quick walk to the subway to get into Manhattan in 20 minutes! Lastly, Laurie is such a great host who makes you feel relaxed and right at home. You really can't do better than Laurie's place! But book early because she gets full fast!
"
5803,11912280,19/4/14,10831414,Susana,"Notre séjour chez Laurie a été vraiment merveilleux. Sa maison est accueillante et il fait bon vivre à Brooklyn. De plus, Laurie est une personne vraiment adorable et elle n'hésitera pas à vous conseiller pour savoir où manger les meilleurs pancakes ! Nous y retournerons sans hésiter ! Encore merci à elle !"
5803,12326982,29/4/14,11000728,Helle,"I enjoyed very much to stay at Lauries place. Nice house and friendly velcoming.
It was easy to go  into Manhattan by subway and living in Brooklyn opened your eyes for that area too.  Laurie provided us with very good tips. Thanks
"
5803,12995913,17/5/14,9834544,Maria,"We (me and my family) had a great week in Park Slope! Laurie is a great hostess. Welcoming, friendly, open, straight forward and very helpful. The rooms (we rented four rooms in total) were all nice, spacious and clean. In addition the house had a nice garden which Laurie generously let us use for a family barbecue. We spent a lot of time in Brooklyn but getting into Manhattan was no problem since the subway is only a 5 minute walk away. "
5803,13107859,19/5/14,6491937,James,"Wonderful neighborhood. Comfortable bed. Easy and pleasant, everyone treated  me very well. Thank you."

I am happy she is of fan of my work! Thanks for your support Laurie! "
5803,15985690,19/7/14,7170476,Stephanie,"Very beautiful house in a friendly neighboorhood with really good access to Manhattan and all other areas.... I was staying with Laurie for 10 days, the room was nice with a comfortable bed and air conditioning.  Laurie was very helpful with any issues I had during my stay... problems with the taxi driver, maps for New York, restaurants etc. Also she took care of my laundry, what was really nice. What is important for guests to know is that there are other guests on the same floor, so you have to share the bathroom. Laurie has a helpful son and two nice cats, so don´t be afraid of Badman and Robin (the cats), because they might jump to your bed in the middle of the night..... :) Would recommend this place!"
5803,17152663,8/8/14,14216096,Staffan,"We (me and my wife) had an amazing time at Laurie's place. But let me take this in three steps: the location, the house and the host. 
Laurie's place is located in a relatively quiet street between two nice avenues full of restaurants, stores, cafés and other cool stuff and it's only a few blocks (about 5 minutes walk) from the metro which goes straight to Manhattan. Super nice neighborhood. Perfect location i would say. 
The house itself was lovely. There are three floors (or four if you will, there's a basement too): the bottom floor with a living room and kitchen, the second floor with two rooms and a bathroom, and the third floor with two rooms and a bathroom as well. We stayed in one of the rooms on the third floor. It worked out great. The only thing was that the wifi didn't reach the whole way up which could be a little bit frustrating, but it worked fine in the living room/kitchen. Also the hose was clean. 
Laurie was a great host. She was so helpful from the very beginning and gave us a lot of help in different ways. She served breakfast every morning (good breakfast too!) which was nice and comfortable. She also gave some advices what to do in the city and it was very fun to just hang out with her, a really nice person. 
If you are considering renting a room, all I can say is that it worked really well for us and we had a very good time there and I can definitely recommend it!"
5803,17304429,10/8/14,18585803,Cindy,"Warm welcome, left suitcase in living room with no worries, had a great cup of coffee! Directions to lodging were excellent."
5803,17671944,16/8/14,13517005,Christine,"Notre séjour d'une semaine chez Laurie a été très agréable. Nous sommes arrivés assez tard le 1 er jour mais Laurie nous a attendu . Le lendemain au petit déjeuner elle nous a donné qqs explications en français sur les visites à faire et nous a remis  les clefs de sa maison pour que nous puissions aller et venir à notre guise . Chaque matin nous nous servions dans son réfrigérateur pour préparer notre petit déjeuner et faire ""comme chez soi"". 
La maison de Laurie est située dans un quartier  très calme . Nous sommes souvent rentrés assez tard le soir sans jamais nous sentir en insécurité. Le métro est très proche du logement permettant d'accéder en 3/4 d'heure environ à Manhattan."
5803,18259637,24/8/14,2131239,Dan,Laurie's house is a beautiful Victorian in a vibrant and interesting neighbourhood. The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was generous. There was a bike rental place nearby and we spent an entire day exploring Brooklyn from The Brooklyn Bridge to Coney Island.
5803,19064736,6/9/14,11541435,Emmanuelle,Superbe séjour passé chez Laurie. Laurie est accueillante et nous a donné de précieux conseils concernant les restaurants et les événements culturels se déroulant à Manhattan et à Brooklyn. La chambre était parfaite et nous avons très bien dormi (bon matelas et chambre climatisée). Les deux chats sont adorables et attachants. Que du positif et un super séjour à New york. 
5803,21939222,27/10/14,12730153,Bruno,"Had an incredible time at lauries place. Clean room and bathroom, confortable bed, great breakfast and last but not least, great company. Laurie recommended great places for us to visit with directions and even some discount groupons. Batman and Robin are friendly and we had them at our door most mornings. If you are not a cat person you will definetly be once you meet them. The only complaint we have is with the wifi signal not reaching the 3rd floor of the house, but know for fact that Laurie is working on getting it fixed."
5803,22368531,4/11/14,7220467,Alicia,"Mi esposo y yo pasamos 5 noches en casa de Laurie. Lo más importante al hacer esta reseña es que nos hemos sentido como en nuestra casa, Laurie es una mujer muy cercana que te dará toda la información que solicites. El desayuno es muy completo (café, té, chocolate, tostadas, bollería fresca, queso, zumos, etc) te lo sirves tú con total libertad. La casa tiene 4 habitaciones que estuvieronocupadas durante toda nuestra estancia, todas ellas son espaciosas y con cómodas camas. Laurie te facilita cualquier producto de aseo, como champú, gel, loción hidrantante y secador de pelo que están ahí a tu disposición. En la casa viven dos gatos, suelen estar en la planta de abajo y no molestan. 
La casa se encuentra situada en una zona muy tranquila de Brooklyn y con varias líneas de metro a dos calles de distancia que te llevan directas a Manhattan en 20 ó 25 minutos. Muy buena comunicación. 
La única pega, por decir algo, es el orden. Al tener tanta gente y Laurie trabajar no siempre está todo ordenado. Aún así durante los días que estuvimos cuando había algún cambio de huéspedes venía una chica de servicio doméstico a limpiar las habitaciones. 
Volveríamos sin dudarlo. ¡Muchas gracias por todo, Laurie! "
5803,22747907,13/11/14,5225909,Dirk," Laurie was a wonderful and friendly host. She informed me on all the events, restaurant and transportation in the area. The location was perfect with easy access to Manhattan and other parts of Brooklyn. The room was very neat, tidy and clean.  Highly reccomended."
5803,23996171,16/12/14,16879944,Allan,"Laurie is a very nice host.  Always ready to help or make you feel at home.  From the croissants served every morning to the laundry she offered to do for her guests.
The house is gorgeous, big and full of light.  The backyard is also welcoming.
The room is big with very nice linens, pillows, heating and a great desk to work or use your laptop.  (wifi does not work upstairs which is good because you must go to the living room to use it while you interact with other guests or Laurie).
The bathroom is big and clean (you'll only share with the other guest in the next door room).
The two cats are also welcoming and they don't refuse a warm human touch.
The apartment is close to everything that's essential in Park Slope.  It is 3-4 blocks away from the G, N, R and F trains.  20 minutes from Manhattan.  But... why Manhattan???  You're in Brooklyn!!  Enjoy!!!
I would definitely recommend Laurie's Listing."
5803,25474884,17/1/15,22627,Julie,"Laurie is a very friendly, gracious host. She checked in with me a few times to make sure everything was acceptable. The neighborhood of Park Slope is great. It has lots of restaurants and shops within short walking distance of Laurie's home. I stayed in a room on the third floor of the house. A winding staircase leads to the room, and the bath is shared with any guest who might rent the other room on the floor (in my case, the other room was only rented out for the last couple of days of my stay). The bedroom and bath were both very clean and pleasant. I did not partake in breakfast, although Laurie made sure that breakfast was available in her kitchen."
5803,26870987,21/2/15,3367796,Christine,"Our stay with Laurie has been great. Nothing is too much trouble for her, from staying up to greet us in the first night we arrived at 2.00am in the morning, having yummy breakfast supplies waiting for us everyday, recommending great cafés and shops, even doing our washing, which was totally unexpected. 
The room was lovely, comfortable and clean with everything you need. Overall a wonderful Airbnb experience. Thank you Laurie. "
5803,29164465,5/4/15,12875475,Sara,Great stay in Laurie's beautiful home. Laurie gave us great tips on where to eat locally and left us breakfast evey morning. The house is in a quiet neighbourhood but within easy reach of Manhattan. Thank - you Laurie!!
5803,30496962,23/4/15,27759167,Steve,"The room was located very close to the local shopping strip with many places to eat and socialise as well as being just 2 or 3 minutes walk from the subway accessing Manhattan and many other places. The room was quite large and had good storage facilities for hanging clothes, etc. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was shared but still was more than serviceable. She went out of her way to ensure that we were comfortable and provided options for things to do both in Manhattan and locally."
5803,31626500,8/5/15,14612191,Carly,"Laurie was nice, interesting and interested in our plans.  The bed was so comfortable and the room was full of books, especially ones my daughter had read as a young reader.  The shower was strong and hot. The fellow travelers were interesting.  The house is in a safe neighborhood and just blocks from the subway.  We (60 yo mom & 23 yo daughter) walked around at night and felt safe.  Laurie gave us lots of information about nearby restaurants.  She had bagels and chocolate croissants(yum) for us each morning. She has a wonderful garden in the back.  It took us about 30-40 minutes to get to downtown NYC on the subway from her house.  It was a great vacation!"
5803,32891400,23/5/15,1128205,Bernadette,"Dank der umfassenden Wegbeschreibung von Laurie habe ich sowohl den Weg vom JFK Flughafen zu ihrem Haus ""easy"" gefunden wie auch den Zugang zu meinem Zimmer."

She has everything you would need there, and she was very helpful and accommodating. We fell in love with her sweet cats! We would definitely book a stay there again. "
5803,40438247,31/7/15,32731960,Chiara,"I was at Laurie's place in July with a friend of mine. Staying at Laurie's B&B was great!

If I ever happen to be in NYC again, I will definitely choose her B&B again!"
5803,42814314,16/8/15,20531425,Kristina,Laurier property is pleasant and well located with Park Slope having good connections to various subway lines. We were offered breakfast daily but late risers we usually went out for brunch. Laurie is flexible and tries to give as much advice as she can on the local area's restaurants and attractions.

5803,45568261,4/9/15,37884197,Jean-Sébastien,"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour chez Laurie. La maison est superbe, très grande pour une ville comme NYC, 2 étages et un jardin (et 2 chats très mignons).

 Le quartier est très agréable, il s'agit d'une des parties les plus jolies de Brooklyn : grand parc, rues bordées d'arbres, ambiance village et beaucoup de petits cafés (essayez le Barbes et l'Union Hall), restaurants et quelques endroits pour sortir. C'est un endroit idéal si vous disposez d'un peu de temps pour visiter New-York et ne pas seulement faire Manhattan. Park Slope est très bien relié au centre, la maison est à quelques dizaines de mètres du métro (lignes F, G, R). Il faut compter entre 30 minutes et 45 minutes pour se rendre au centre de Manhattan selon les lignes, ce qui est assez court pour une ville de cette taille. Facilité d'accès aux coins à la mode de Brooklyn comme Williamsburg, Brooklyn Heights (où se trouve le Brooklyn Tabernacle pour aller écouter du gospel, moins de monde qu'à Harlem).

Laurie est une hôte discrète mais qui connaît beaucoup sur la ville et saura vous aider elle nous a donné beaucoup de bons plans sur ce qu'il y avait à faire dans la ville, notamment les concerts, les musées, les marchés. Par ailleurs, elle vous envoie un guide PDF très bien fait avec beaucoup d'adresses. Le petit-déjeuner (bagels, fromage, jus, café) est inclus, ce qui est un plus. A savoir, si les trois chambres d'invités sont remplies, il peut y avoir jusqu'à 7 personnes dans la maison, mais il y a de l'espace donc ce n'est pas gênant.

Nous sommes contents de notre voyage :)"

Reviendrons!"

My room was very comfortable and I felt like having all the privacy I needed during my 2 weeks stay.
I would totally recommend Laurie's place - great place in Brooklyn!"

Laurie is a great host that arranges everything you need and is a kind and 'gezellig' (Dutch word, untranslatable...) person. Her little booklet on the house, New York and Brooklyn is a very handy guide to welcome you in the house and the city. And o yeah, the cats are very kind and cuddley too ;-)
Thanks Laurie!"
5803,90751104,2/8/16,4213410,Gary,Park Slope is my favorite neighborhood to stay... Great restaurants & cafes and easy access to subway. Laurie was very gracious and the accommodations were excellent! We enjoyed our stay and we plan come again next time we're in Brooklyn.

5803,103433977,22/9/16,90896193,Regina,"Lovely home. Great neighborhood. Close to shops, restaurants and subway. Laurie is very helpful and friendly. Room was large with plenty of space for suitcases. Shelves inside the closet helped to keep things organized. Really appreciated having a desk in the room to work. Excellent Wifi. "
5803,104800026,28/9/16,29792433,Greg,"Staying at Laurie's quaint Brooklyn home was probably the smartest decision of my entire trip--quiet, clean, comfy, and hassle free! I arrived at an odd (early morning) hour and Laurie was still completely accommodating and welcoming. My room was at the top of two flights of narrow, very creaky stairs, but it just adds to the atmosphere of the house. Just tread lightly if you arrive home late! My bed was a super comfortable queen size and was generously given three pillows for optimal sleeping.

As far as getting around, it's a great location located in Park Slopes, less than a mile from Prospect Park and a few blocks away from two direct lines to the heart of Manhattan. Even at peak hours it never took me more than 30 minutes to get to Times Square. 

Laurie as a host was ideal; welcoming and friendly, but not overbearing or nosy. We had a pleasant conversation when I arrived and then I was left to my own devices to explore the city. If I had a question or needed a suggestion, she was on hand to give the best advice. Top quality host. Really made my vacation the relaxing breeze I needed it to be. I highly recommend giving Laurie's home a visit!"
5803,106276673,5/10/16,1418568,Tony,"The house is in a good neighborhood in Brooklyn.  Laurie is a very nice host. She is effective and detailed person who would let you self use many facilities in this house. The two cats are lovely.  There is a warm and welcoming atmosphere in this house, especially with many children books - her father is a famous cartoon illustrator. We enjoyed the stay very much."

5803,151039082,10/5/17,21964299,Jeongin,Laurie was a great host. She knows so much about the neighborhood that it was super easy for us to navigate around the house. She provides an amazing breakfast each morning. Never imagined I could get complimentary breakfast at an Airbnb house. I had some good and bad Airbnb experiences but Laurie's house was so so great. I would stay there again and recommend it to anyone! 
5803,153515438,21/5/17,9692601,Lia,"We had a wonderful stay at Laurie's place, while visiting with our daughter who lives in Park Slope.  Sharing the bathroom was not a problem, as we found all guests using it were mindful and courteous.  We appreciated all the extra amenities that Laurie provides: a good reading light on both sides of the bed, lots of room and shelves in the closet, a first aid kit in the bathroom, shampoo, conditioner, fresh and delicious croissants, bagels, cream cheese, organic milk and OJ for breakfast. . . all yummy and plentiful.   The backyard garden was at its prime and lovely.  What a gem we found.  Thank you, Laurie, and we hope to see you again!"
5803,157143035,2/6/17,56281844,Stephanie,Laurie's place is really great! Close to subway (R and F ) so there's easy access into the city. It's on a quiet area in Park Slope but still close to everything the area has to offer in terms of restaurants and bars. The room is a good size and has everything anyone could need. Fair amount of closet space.  Beautiful garden.

The house was even more beautiful than on pictures, and the room was very (by New York standards: VERY) spacious. It felt very homey and we had a great time staying there and exploring the neighborhood and going for nice dinners close by. Subway is also only a couple min walk. Breakfast provided is a good plus. The garden and indoor decoration are very nice. Tree-lined streets of Park Slope are beautiful. Laurie was an amazing host by e-mail even though she had a last minute urgency that prevented us to meet each other, but she was very responsive and helpful - thank you again!"

5803,215063645,27/11/17,145883925,Deb,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Laurie’s home. It is a funky, century old (if not more) house. If you want authentic Brooklyn, this is the place for you! The location is fantastic. Close to transit, shops, restaurants. The neighbourhood is safe and welcoming. The price is right as well.

Laurie is kind and generous with information, tips, resources and breakfast treats. We will definitely be back."
5803,215255784,28/11/17,63105155,Hilary,"Laurie’s place was perfect for us. Accommodations were spacious and comfortable. Having access to a kitchen was great. Her location is a few minutes from subways and close to specialty markets of South Slope. Most of all, Laurie was at hand to answer all questions, welcome us warmly, and give us an expansive printout that oriented us to everything Brooklyn. She is gracious host!"
5803,215410810,29/11/17,17689150,Kate,"Laurie's house is just a fantastic landing place in Brooklyn. She offers as much or as little as a traveler would want. She provides a wealth of suggestions for local restaurants, activities and overall things to do in the area. Her house is filled with fantastic art on the walls and a real cozy space to enjoy. I wouldn't stay anywhere else when traveling to the area."
5803,215761639,1/12/17,150556350,Claire,Good value for the price!
5803,216918331,6/12/17,10483740,Evie,Laurie opens her beautiful home to you relaxedly and with grace. Tons of thoughtfulness about YOUR particular stay and needs. Location couldn't be better. You'll never go hungry - gobs of great restaurants and easy walk to subway in and out of the city. The best place I've found to stay in NY!
5803,223100404,31/12/17,161677119,Clara,Laurie's house was good to stay. Location is 2 blokcs away from the subway station. Everything was beautiful in the house. Especially I couldn't get up in the morning because the bed was perfect! I could eat everything in the freezer. You can stay with a reasonable price in BR!
5803,243880444,17/3/18,70731536,Natalie,"Although this was my sixth trip to New York, my stay at Laurie’s place in Park Slope was one of the most positive experiences. When I arrived, Laurie was extremely welcoming. Her home is located on a beautiful tree-lined street, located one or two blocks (in every direction) from stores and restaurants. The 5th Avenue bus stop is one block away . And the subway was a mere three-block walk. 

I liked the fact that it was quiet, even when other guests were staying in the house. I never heard my neighbors. 

Because I was busy with work and meetings, I didn’t get to spend much time in in the place. But it was nice to come home to after a long day galavanting."
5803,252924503,12/4/18,6367569,Katharina,"Laurie ist nicht nur ein wundervoller ""superhost"", sondern auch ein besonderer Mensch. Obwohl sie sich gerade erst von einer Operation erholt, hat sie sich liebevoll um mich gekümmert. Schon am 1. Abend hat sie mir alle Tricks und Kniffe des NYC Subwaysystems erklärt. Sie ist sehr ""parkslopy"" entspannt, was gut tut. Sie kann Dir tolle Tipps geben, was Museum, Essen, Musik, Taxigebrauch etc. angeht. Außerdem kannst Du mit ihr tolle Gespräche über amerikanische Politik führen. Ihr Vater ist der berühmte Kinderbuch Autor und Maler Steven Kellogg. Das schöne 3-stöckige Haus hängt voll mit seinen Zeichnungen. Eine tolle Atmosphäre! Die Zimmer und das Bad werden professionell gereinigt. Du hast während Deines Aufenthalts dort evtl. Mitbewohner, was schön ist, aber nicht störend. Alles in allem eine tolle Möglichkeit in dem schönen Brooklyn Park Slope zu wohnen."
5803,255464835,20/4/18,55710488,Stephanie,"Maison typique agréable, attention la salle de bain et les WC sont à partager.
Petit déjeuner copieux si vous aimez les bagels , en revanche prévoir de laver vos tasses et nettoyer le petit dej.
Laurie manque un peu de chaleur pour une Hôte.
Endroit pratique pour les transports, prévoir 40 mn pour rejoindre Manhattan."
5803,271853956,2/6/18,179568445,Regan,"Laurie's place was wonderful! I was only there for a few days, but it could definitely have easily been comfortable longer term. The room's desk was good for working at, but I ended up being out in the garden most of the time since it was in full bloom this time of year. Felt like I was living in a loving home with an international heart. And on top of all that the fresh bagels, cream cheese, coffee, and laundry were as promised!"
5803,276385341,13/6/18,191616150,Mahmudur,This is a wonderful place to stay. Park Slope is a great neighborhood.
5803,286595581,6/7/18,13845901,Mark,"It's a reasonable size room for two people, with cozy bed and quality bedding. You don't get that in many short term visitor accommodation . The breakfast is very good, but nothing is actually ""served"". Unfortunately, there is no lounge space or kitchen possibilities other than breakfast, so you have to always eat out, which is not great in NYC because it runs up your costs of being ther big time. But, Laurie is an interesting character, with a lot of good advice, and seems she genuinely enjoys meeting new people with cool things to talk about. By NY standards, Park Slope is a very fun place to spend some days."
5803,291190957,15/7/18,69084327,Ann,Laurie is an amazing host. She was very accommodating and provided me with a ton of information to make my visit special! 
5803,306380111,12/8/18,64667270,Hongyan,"Laurie's place is a real Airab&b, perfect breakfast with hot coffee,tea, good begal, juice, milk etc.are provided ; the linien is clean and soft; the bed is comfy;the books are generously displayed on the shelf (my daughter enjoyed reading them a lot); the neighborhood is safe and friednly with various eateries and supermarkets; the subway is within comfortable walking distance,etc. 
Plus, Laurie gave us many helpful suggestions about the places to see and eat. She's one of the best hosts in AirBnb I have ever met. Especially the night I arrived her home was very late, she was still waiting to meet us, and having warm conversations with us. It's not like some AirBnb, you cannot see and talk with the hosts. Laurie is always there.
I highly recommend Laurie's place for  having great experience in Brooklyn NY.   "
5803,318185448,3/9/18,33134287,Katie,"Beautiful home in a fantastic neighborhood!  Laurie runs a very professional Airbnb,  Her guidebook is  amazing and the coffee here is delicious!  She is a wealth of information about the area.  The art in the house is fun too!"
5945,9771,11/9/09,36956,Russell,"Robin was a great host. She made arrangements for me to drop off my bags early even though she was not at home. Great location, near subway and busses, Central Park. She also helped me with logistics, best way to get to the airport, where to eat, Post office location, etc. I would stay there again or recommend it whole heartedly.
Thanks Robin!"
5945,13113,11/10/09,37982,Regina,"We stayed 6 nights and really enjoyed our wonderful trip to NYC. The location is excellent (safe and just a few minutes to subway, central park + museums, cafés, bars, shops...). The area itself is worth spending time!! Robin was a great host and her typical NY-style apartment is very clean and beautiful furnished, the room (maybe a little small for two - so don't bring too much luggage) has a comfortable airbed or sofabed for two, TV, internet,... all you need for a perfect stay! We definitely recomment staying here. Thanks Robin for all your help navigating around this amazing City! You made us feeling at home in your lovely apartment! "

5945,16655,8/11/09,48506,Phillip,"Despite having really hurt her back, Robin made space for me in her home.  It was my first time in NYC and I found the location to be great (really nice to be able to stroll to Central Park) and Robin more than willing to help out with useful info.
It is really nice to stay with someone in a home rather than a souless hotel.

She walked us right to her door on the phone, expalined all the parking rules to us, helped us with public transportation, and provided us with a clean, safe and secure place to stay. All in a very nice area of the city and extremly convinient location to subways and local attractions! Again, thank you Robin for opening your home to us and helping make our trip to New York an enjoyable experience to remember all while allowing us to keep it affordable!
I look forward to staying with you again in the future!"
5945,26722,17/2/10,2,Joe,"I had a chance to stay with Robin at her West Side location, and was grateful for the experience. I've traveled extensively through Airbnb, and am proud to have Robin hosting on the site. The apartment is cozy and authentic, filled with art and instruments. As a host, she offers a personable experience that can't be matched by a hotel chain. I hope future Airbnb travelers get to stay at one of her apartments! Joe, Co-founder"
5945,33848,6/4/10,86580,Alexandra,"I stayed in Robin's Room on the UWS for a week in April. The apartment is well located in a really safe area of New York, near to the subway and buses, plus lots of good shops. Robin is a great host and you really get a sense of living like a New Yorker. The Wifi came in very handy. Highly recommended."
5945,59414,30/6/10,147466,Jeff,"Robin is a great hostess.  Her beautiful apartment on the UWS could not be in a more convenient location.  Robin was available to answer questions, share music recordings, provide tips about the area and help with connecting to the very fast WiFi connection.  She will provide a great NYC experience to any traveler."

5945,112636,5/10/10,249071,Tim,"Robin has a nice place on the upper westside and she was a super duper host.  I needed a place below 100th street, where I wouldn't spend much time just a place to sleep and take a shower mostly and Robin's place was perfect.  She set me up with an air mattress in her office which was comfortable and I slept fine.  She's really nice and easy to deal with, and I would recommend a stay there.

This is the first time that I paid in full by credit card ( with a guaranteed reservation), and my room was given away. As I am exceedingly pleasant, I agreed to sleep on her couch. Visiting Robin is like staying with a good friend in her apt.   I have only one suggestion for airbnb - please tell your hosts that it would be wonderful to provide the guests with morning coffee & toast.   thanks.   "

Before I ventured out Robin gave  me directions so I could take a shortcut to where I was headed.  She also told me facts I needed so it was easy to use New York public transportation.  Robin's a great hostess who is kind and courteous as well.  Definitely, try staying at Robin's on the upper  West Side."

i totally recommand Robin's place!"
5945,1190748,28/4/12,1422116,Jens,"top room in the heart of nyc. (upper west side, central park 4 minutes by feet, subway 2 minutes.)
robin is a very friendly and a very unsophisticated renter.
the heating system was also very friendly ;-), to regulate only with open windows. but that is not really a problem.
anytime again.
thank you"
5945,1242950,7/5/12,2217396,Rich,"Robin is an excellent, professional and above all friendly host.  As many have noted she offers current information on events and resources.  And she dealt with some unexpected unique issues we presented with grace and congeniality."
5945,1469318,12/6/12,2448337,Jack,"This was my first time using airbnb and my first time visiting New York City. It was a vacation that included visiting my son who was staying in Brooklyn for an extended period of time due to business.

Robin was absolutely great! She was kind, helpful and very informative. In fact, on the first day of my trip, she stayed with me for the first half of the day helping me rent a bike and showing me the bike trail along the Hudson. Her place is in one of the best locations you can ask for on the upper west side. She is just a few minutes walk west to the Hudson or east to Central Park. I absolutely recommend her apartment when staying in Manhattan."
5945,1545582,23/6/12,2671968,Michele,"My son and I loved staying in Robin's place during our recent trip to NYC.  Her apartment is located in a great part of the Upper West Side, close to great restaurants, buses and the subway. She was great at communicating with me and very accommodating.  I would stay there again!"
5945,1598130,30/6/12,2315176,Harris,"We couldn't have asked for a more thoughtful, warm and accommodating  host than Robin Greenstein.  My daughter (12) often has trouble adapting to new environments and she loved our new spot right away.The location of Robin's Room on New York's ""fabulous"" Upper West Side is perfect, and unlike many other similarly located flats, there's an elevator which came in handy for our one heavy bag and quick ingress and egress. Robin was quick to share snacks as well as tips on all the free events and entertainment happening in the city.   We also found the place very clean, and I loved the old, Craftsmen bathtub in the bathroom.  These are the PROS.

CONS:  Although I may have seen it in one of the reviews, and Robin may have disclosed it... I had trouble sleeping first night due to considerable night and early morning traffic noise.  If you are a light sleeper, I recommend closing the windows and turning on the air conditioner on the first night, even on fan if the weather isn't too hot.  I also got ear plugs at the Duane Reade's right across the street.  With those adjustments, I slept great.  Kitchen is very small and I didn't feel comfortable cooking there.  My daughter slept comfortably on the sofa (not pulled out to the bed).  for me, Robin provided an Aerobed that was not as comfortable as other air mattresses I've slept on.  

All in all, we loved it at Robin's, and I would stay there again, especially if I knew there was a new air mattress.

Only glitch with this experience was the phone app which, when I reached out to Robin, sent my message back to me from me instead of to her."
5945,7565915,24/9/13,8640009,Yu,"Robin's room is just like how she described in her description, which is also the reason I choose her place.

The neighbourhood is so nice, safe to walk even in midnight, and convenient to get food and everything, and easy to take metro in 3 minutes walk only. And very easy to walk to central park and museums. Robin's apartment is so cosy, it gives the feeling that it's really a home not a ""stranger's house"". Robin gave me a big surprise when she offered me some dumplings on the first night when I arrived, which made her place even more like a home to me. 
I'll definitely recommend her place!"

5945,20473436,29/9/14,915487,Dan,Robin's place was very comfortable and exactly as described. Easy to communicate with. Awesome neighborhood. Great experience. 
5945,21990984,27/10/14,255394,Benoit,"Robin was nice and I stayed at her place for a few nights. It was clean and well located. 
The only point would be the bed that was pretty thin so I felt the structure pretty much and was not that comfortable. 
Thanks anyway for making me great in your place!"
5945,42169619,11/8/15,32700337,Ivo,Robin is a very helpful interesting host even for a very short stay . Thx. 
5945,46249718,8/9/15,34957802,Jennifer,"Robin accepted our last minute booking request and was a very pleasant and understanding host.  She even changed her schedule to accommodate our needs.  The apartment was perfect and in a great UWS location!  Thanks, Robin, for all the great recommendations and suggestions to make the weekend enjoyable!"
5945,51680072,22/10/15,14741120,Ria,"I love this neighborhood which was very local in the upper west, and the location was also very convenient. It's 3 minutes' walk to Line 1, taking you to most attractions. Also a 10min walk to Central Park where I went to every morning for a wonderful walk to start a tourist's day. The building has an elevator which is a bonus if you have big luggage. 
The host Robin is a nice lady. She is kind, generous, organized and also flexible. We had a glad chat on music, films and culture and her travel as well, sharing her beer.
The room, as Robin described, was a bit noisy during the night due to the old windows. I suggest to take a pair of earplugs along with you.
If you don't like the crowded tourists' places, this would be a great location. Thank you Robin for having me!"
5945,192505070,10/9/17,138394851,Noelle,"Robin was an amazing hostess! My original Air Bnb host cancelled the reservation just hours before I left my hometown so I had to find someone new on the bus. Robin texted back right after I requested and told me it was absolutely not a problem for her if I stayed at her place, that was 1 hour before the arrival time!
Her apartment is very cute and I instantly felt safe and at home. The area is a great place to stay in NY for a few days! Her apartment is about a 5-10 minute walk from Central Park, just down the street. There is a Starbuck's, Dunkin Donuts and a 24 hour CVS right around the corner and the Subway stop is about a 2 minute walk. Very fast and easy to get to Midtown or any other place in the city.

About Robin, she is a very warm, welcoming and nice person and very easy to talk to. We had some great talks! She offered me tea, coffee and even eggs one time she made some in the morning. I definitely felt comfortable staying with her and even more, you can see she cares about the personal aspect of Air Bnb, offering someone to stay in your HOME for a while. She gave me space to be on my own but was very open for contact and nice talks! I really enjoyed being with her.

I can only recommend staying at her place, great apartment, great hostess, I would definitely stay there again!
Thank you!!!"
5945,201961793,9/10/17,82572170,Jessica,"Robin was great! She was always very quickly to respond, gave me excellent tips about the city and the best places to go. The room was exactly as described and is well located in Manhattan"
5945,317710798,2/9/18,121928271,Utkarsh,"Robin is a great host, very responsive and interestingly a great musician. We had a sofa cum bed for me and my wife and was quite comfortable. She provided separate towels, and a bed sheet and blankets and of course pillows. The apartment although being old but is nicely maintained and is very close to time square and theater district. You can easily find free parking around the street if you are here on the weekend. Overall I loved my stay at Robin’s apartment."

The room, bed, and bath were clean and quiet.  I would definitely recommend Claudio's place and I hope to stay there again next time I am in NYC.  This was my first time using airbnb to plan my accommodations and the experience has been great!"

Very clean, safe, comfortable, bright. Claudio is very nice and polite person! He helped us with a lot of informations. We would highly recommend this place which we will come back for sure. Thank You again Claudio!"
6021,9705,11/9/09,26993,Deborah,"My husband and I were scheduled to stay with Claudio the week of Labor Day in order to celebrate our 11th wedding anniversary.  On Aug. 18th my husband was on his way home from work on his motorcycle when a man turned in front of him.  He was admitted to the hospital.  I emailed Claudio the next day to cancel our plans and inquired about a refund.  Claudio said he couldn't refund the money but would let us come stay another date, which I appreciated.  The next day my husband unexpectedly died from his injuries.  I emailed Claudio again but did not hear back from him.

Last week I emailed airb&b.  They spoke with Claudio and he agreed to refund 50% of our deposit. I really appreciate this very much.

This morning my doorbell rang and the florist was standing there with a beautiful arrangement.  When I opened the card, it was from  airb&b.  I couldn't believe it!  This is such a great site!

My children and I will certainly use this site in the future.

Again, thanks to Claudio and airb&b!

He was a great host, the room was immaculate, the flat quirky, and we had no complaints! The flat is in a great location, right next to Central Park, minutes from the Subway and safe at night. Would definitely recommend him -and I just did to a friend, which is when I realised I hadn't written this! "

We would have liked to have known ahead of time that he had a roommate. Some mornings it was difficult to share a bathroom with four people (obviously we weren't all in there at the same time!). But it was a minor inconvenience and everything else was wonderful. Very clean, very comfortable, great neighbourhood, easy walk to the subway. I would recommend staying here. If you are a light sleeper, bring a face mask and (Website hidden by Airbnb) isn't loud per se, but it is on a main street and the subway runs under the building. My husband had no problems at all, but I'm very sensitive. Thanks Claudio!"

We got there, the room was very clean, the bed was confortable and even the sheets smelled like fresh laundry. it was so cozy that it felt like my own room. As for the shared bathroom, my friend and i had no problem, we never got to wait in line or anything since we always went out early morning. The towels and soaps were provided also. He even told us to use the kitchen, but didnt get to use it since we ate out all the time. Perfect location, right next to a beautiful park and easy to find! We only saw Claudio the first day and our last day :)  Thank you Claudio!"
6021,25386,4/2/10,49826,Ed,Thank you Claudio. Just returned from ten days staying at Claudio's place. Very good location although we didn't see Claudio often as we were busy when we did he was very helpful and accommodating. Would not hesitate to stay there again. Great place.

Claudio's place, situated just opposite Central Park, with Columbia University not far away (cheap breakfast cafes if you wanna eat out) is perfect for visiting NYC! I really loved that place, very clean, very cosy, good bed, all fresh and clean, with fresh towels and soap. Claudio is a great guy and always helpful. I really enjoyed having found a private place where you can be totally independent and feel comfortable. hope to go back there!"

Cozy room and bed with a small LCD tv - very nicely furnished and super clean. Bathroom is shared but always tidy and clean; has a bathtub and soap is provided. Claudio is a great host - but we had very different schedules so didn't interact much at all. Only downside is the subway runs right next to the apartment, which is on the first floor, so the room could be really noisy at night and in the morning - consider using ear plugs if you're a light sleeper."
6021,32240,29/3/10,97795,Tate,"I stayed for 3 days and had a very pleasant experience. Claudio is a very gracious host, even though we did not interact much due to our schedules. I agree with Cindy H's review -- clean room, tidy bathroom, but can be noisy at night because of the subway. Earplugs were a must for me.

The whole flat was very clean with plenty of hot (Website hidden by Airbnb) is very bijou for 2 guests, the host and his partner.

It was very loud and I forgot to take earplugs.This was our first experience of airbnb and was very postive. Muita obrigada Clauido"
6021,38370,27/4/10,76580,Amandine,"We enjoyed our 12 nights stay at Claudio’s place and loved the easy access to Central Park ! If you want to stay in the heart of Manhattan, in a clean, safe, and comfortable home, and at a nice affordable price, this is the answer. Do remember that you'll need to use earplugs to sleep properly. "

The upper west side is a beautiful neighborhood with many photo opportunities for shutter-bugs.  Claudio’s home provides an easy-going, quiet, friendly ambience.  If you want to stay in the heart of Manhattan, in a clean, safe, and comfortable home, and at a nice affordable price, this is the answer. Do remember to pick up  earplugs for a good nights sleep. I did, slept like a rock, and enjoyed every day and night of my stay with Manhattan at my doorstep.  Thank-you, Claudio and Kiko! "

6021,141704,20/11/10,115871,Daniel,"I spent a lot of time researching accommodations and Claudio's place looked the best--and WAS the best--a wonderful place to stay! 

Great location a block from the subway in a safe neighborhood and building. You get your own stylish, comfortable and scrupulously *clean* room (you share the bath, but I always felt like I had it to myself). You can't cook, but you can use the refrigerator and microwave.

The room has a comfortable bed, wardrobe, as well as it's own heater and AC, so you can be as warm or cool as you want--a big deal when it comes to comfort. Yes, you should bring earplugs, but that's true of almost any place in NYC because the traffic noise can be loud--but with earplugs I slept soundly, and I never heard any noise from within the apartment.

Claudio gives you a set of keys, so you can come and go as you want--kind of like having your own apartment on fashionable Central Park West! And he was very accommodating about letting me arrive early--as well as leaving my bags until I was ready to go to the airport, then dropping off the keys. 

It couldn't have been an easier, more comfortable or pleasant stay.

Claudio and Kiko are charming guys and great hosts (thank you!) I will definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to my friends."

Their place is warm, cozy and welcoming in a good central location. However, I did find the noise outside to be quite a disturbance - it's really load with traffic and the subway. But then again, the room is fairly priced by Manhattan standards - I guess chiefly because of the noise issue. "

Neighborhood is safe and quiet, but you have to walk 4 blocks (10 minute walk) to get to a street with coffee shops and restaurants.  Room faces the street and the apartment is on the ground floor so you could hear people walking by and talking.  Also, since the subway runs underground along the street the apartment is on, you could hear the trains going by.  None of the above was an issue for me.   I would definitely stay here again."

Ottima disponibilità e libertà all'interno dell'appartamento, Claudio e Chico ci hanno fatto sentire come a casa nostra. Abbiamo usato la cucina per la colazione, ed il frigo per mantenere il cibo. 
L'appartamento è solamente a due isolati dalla metrò (103st). Le prime due notti il rumore della metrò ci ha fatto compagnia, ma con l'uso dei tappi per le orecchie è stato risolto il problema ed abbiamo fatto delle belle dormite. SIcuramente, se dovessimo tornare a New York, l'appartamento di Claudio e Chico sarà la nostra dimora.
Grazie a Claudio e Chico

6021,348998,3/7/11,247766,Valerie,I enjoyed my Manhattan stay very much! The room was quite comfortable and the passing noise on the street was never a problem for me. Claudio's home is very lovely and very clean! I will admit I was slightly nervous since this was my first stay with any Airbnb affiliate - but after that first initial meeting I knew my nervousness had no place. Claudio was very welcoming and helpful with information about the city. I could not have asked for a better host! Thank you very much for allowing me to stay in your home!
6021,365614,11/7/11,562309,Yvette,Great value for money. Loved staying so close to Central Park. Easy to get on subway down into town. Friendly hosts. Would stay here again.
6021,375589,16/7/11,562028,Rebecca,"Claudio's apartment is an excellent place to stay. The room is clean, large and air-conditioned and its close proximity to the subway is extremely convenient. We felt very safe walking the block back from the subway to his apartment. I highly recommend staying at Claudio's!"
6021,388314,22/7/11,418787,James,"Claudio was great, helped me navigate New York, the location is perfect and if i’m New York again i would definitely stay there again"
6021,403722,29/7/11,369245,Emma,"It was my first time to the States & I was travelling alone- the room was perfect, very clean, comfortable & with towels & soap provided. There was free wifi which was fast & an air-conditioner & tv in the room. I would definitely stay here again!"
6021,418991,4/8/11,396076,Rachael,"Claudio and his apartment were great! His apartment is right next to central park, a subway station and was super cute and clean. He gave us our own keys so we could freely go as we please! We are so glad that we decided to go this route in terms of accommodation in NYC. Some reviews said it was noisy from the subway/street but I don't know what these people are talking about...we could here some honking outside (which was minimal) but we never heard the subway or anything that kept us awake. I will most definitely recommend Claudio's place to any of my friends that will travel to Manhattan in the future...and when we go back, we will definitely stay here again. Thanks Claudio!"
6021,425942,7/8/11,779117,Michael,Excellent simple location close to the tube station. Very nice and friendly host. Bedroom was very clean and we had internet access. Only downside was that it was a little noisy but I did not mind at all.  
6021,459487,20/8/11,556583,Sylvia,"I was very apprehensive about booking accommodation for my daughter who was visiting NY for the first time but Airbnb made it really easy for me and I would not hesitate to recommend them.Claudio promptly answered any emails I sent him. My daughter enjoyed every bit of her stay and would definitely make Claudio's place her first choice if she were to visit NY in the future.

6021,471787,24/8/11,783501,Pierre,"Clean appartement in a nice building in front of Central Park (very good place for runners!). The appartement on 1st floor is quite noisy the 1st night but we get used to it very fast. This part of Manhattan is quiet and close to good jazz club.150m to the subway, you will be in the heart of Manhattan in 15-20 min. A very good quality/price ratio for Manhattan.Thanks Claudio!"
6021,491882,1/9/11,354303,Ian,"Central place to stay and Kiko gave us a subway train map when we arrived which we appreciated. Bedroom looks out over Central Park rocks, and the street which is very noisy with trucks, train subway noises, night and day. Bed was not particularly comfortable and told to eat and drink in kitchen, however owners ate in their bedroom. Room was cheap & I suppose you only receive what you pay for. Great internet access. Owners did not see us off and we left keys in bedroom."
6021,497932,3/9/11,924153,Sonia,"A very clean room and bathroom, immaculate bathroom, airconditing and  close to subway to all of New York, no noise and hosts were gracious.  Would do it again."
6021,517125,10/9/11,383004,Jorge,"Nice and clean room, close to a subway station and closer to a bus stop. Claudio and his roommate are very nice and polite as well. I would  recommend this place to a friend. 

It is somewhat noisy but bearable, it did not make me lose any sleep. "
6021,566844,25/9/11,630693,Yossi,"After our previous reservation's been cancelled, we had the good fortune to find Claudio. His apartment in the upper west side was more than we could've hoped for - clean, easy to get to (right near a subway station) and at a great price too.

Claudio was very nice to talk to and respectful of our privacy. The wifi connection was super-fast and it was very straighforward communicating with Claudio.

The apartment isn't in the downtown area, but it takes just a 10 min subway to get there, day or night. All in all, highly recommended!"
6021,596189,4/10/11,651652,Guanzhen,"Great location merely one block away from the 103 St 'C' subway. Claudio and Kiko are friendly, helpful and non-intrusive. Apartment is clean. Location on the 1st floor means that you do not have to drag your luggage up flights of stairs or use the lift."
6021,617921,11/10/11,34736,Janice,"Claudio and his partner Kiko are nice people.  They leave you alone to do your own thing.  The bedroom was very nice.  Bathroom was clean.  The only drawback was the bedroom was a half of a flight of stairs off of the street.  Walk-by traffic is moderate, street traffic is heavy and the subway is under the sidewalk  outside your window with the open grates in the sidewalk so you hear it as well.  I just brought a set of earplugs and that took care of the noise.  Good price for a nice bedroom.  "
6021,627557,14/10/11,175068,Dennis,"Claudio is a great host, the room is a great location if you need to be in Downtown Manhattan (it's 2 easy & short blocks from the subway!). Wish that I'd had a less hectic schedule for the time I was there, as it was fun talking with him.

Looking forward to future visits to NYC and Claudio's place will be at the very top of the (very) short list!

6021,656893,24/10/11,671086,Débora,"Tudo foi muito bem no apartamento do Claudio. Tudo é limpo, agradável... o chuveiro é forte, a cama é super confotável. Vi que alguns guests reclamaram de barulho durante a noite, mas eu não tive problema nenhum quanto a isso - as noites de sono foram ótimas. Acabamos não comprando nada de supermercado, então só usamos mesmo a cozinha para beber água. Claudio e Kiko são pessoas agradáveis e nada intrusivos... nos deixaram bem à vontade. Resumindo: muito boa estadia. Recomendo a todos. 

Everything was just fine in Claudio´s apartment. Very clean and pleansant... good shower, good bed, good sleep. No noyses during night that could make you asleep or wake-up. Claudio and Kiko are nice guys, non intrusive... Resuming: that was a very good stay. I recomend to anyone. "
6021,718088,14/11/11,1343622,Moncef,"Claudio's apartment was a great find! It is clean, comfortable, and in a great location. We drove and had no trouble finding a free parking spot on the street right around the corner. Claudio is very nice and a great host.

If you end up staying here, make sure to go to Absolute Bagels (2788 Broadway) and Silver Moon Bakery (2740 Broadway)."
6021,742634,25/11/11,258036,James,"This was my first trip to New York and my first time using Airbnb and both experiences were great. I'm actually still in the apartment waiting fort lift to the airport when I got the email to leave a review. My stay went very well when I arrived I was met by Claudio and he introduced himself and showed me the room and left me to get on with my trip. He was very helpful when I asked for some information, I didn't see him much as he went to Brazil but his partner Kiko was here who was also very helpful aswell as his assistant Who works here during the day. 

I would highly recommend staying here subway only 2 blocks away and it in Times Square in minutes and the area feels really safe also. Plus the price is very good u can't go wrong

The noise that other reviewers have talked about was not an issue at all!!!
"
6021,767720,6/12/11,1282528,Jose,"A friend and i stayed at Claudio's apartment, and we are so happy because we couldn't find a better host, he is so so so kind, and never bother us about time schedule or things like that.
The place is awesome and very clean, just the idea to wake up right in front of the central park every single day, make me wanna go again. 
I wont think twice if i need to go to NYC again, of course if he let me, i will stay at his place again."
6021,787652,16/12/11,999097,Hanny,"the host was kind and perfect.
the room was too noisy' , we could hear everything from the street, too small.
"
6021,1039368,25/3/12,1607532,Andrew,Everything was first rate - exactly as described - excellent location and high standard in all respects.
6021,1447107,9/6/12,1629027,Marissa,The reservation was canceled 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6021,315347418,28/8/18,39552699,Curtis,"This is an amazing location - across the street from Central Park - for a very reasonable price. (Note, however, the fees are high relative to the nightly rate; this reduces the value a bit.) In fairness, for this review, the host was away the entire time, so I had the entire charming place to myself (except the host's locked locations). Since it is small, and one would be sharing the bathroom and kitchen with the host, the experience would necessarily be different. The small kitchen was nice, and well equipped. There is an excellent large (by NYC standards) market a few blocks away on 110th St at the NW corner of the park. Very close subway stop on 103rd St. Easy walk to Harlem, Columbia Univ, etc.

The unit is on the bottom floor at street level, and the bedroom window opens onto the Central Park West sidewalk at street level. So one must expect some noise, as with any similar NYC location, and particularly with a window AC unit (reasonably quiet, but also a good source of white noise). There is also street light that leaks in, and in the morning light comes in early (east facing window). A good pair of earplugs, and an mask made sleeping - and sleeping in - easy and pleasant. 

Claudio's assistant Kiko - who handled all the arrangements on this occasion - was very pleasant, helpful and accommodating. "

6090,9215,7/9/09,19060,Clare,"As soon as we walked into the apartment it felt like home - beautiful linen and very clean and tidy.
Alina really went out of her way to make our stay enjoyable, and if I get a week in New York again anytime soon we'd love to stay again!
The location is perfect with amazing restaurants around every corner.  Highly recommend!  Thanks again Alina."
6090,11091,23/9/09,19959,Tali,Loved our stay here. Cute and clean apartment in a really great location! Thanks Alina!
6090,12267,3/10/09,38657,Sandrine,"We stayed at Alina's apartment in West Village and it was just perfect. The apartment was bright and very clean (full provided kitchen and wifi). The location is ideal if you want to visit cultural places (close to the Chelsea's galleries), to go out and listen live music or shopping."
6090,13945,18/10/09,30748,Christine,"Nice convenient apartment! With a lot of good restaurants nearby!
We've enjoyed the stay!
Thanks Alina!"
6090,18451,28/11/09,18063,Sarah,"We had a fantastic stay at the Bleecker Street apartment. It was well located, in a beautiful part of NYC, a good size, very clean and had everything we needed. Alina was great to deal with, really friendly, helpful and flexible with our travel plans. BIG THANKS :)"
6090,41788,12/5/10,66133,Cate,"Alinas apartment, in the greatest location for a visitor to NY. Bleecker St is just gorgeous and we often found it took all day to just leave the immediate area as there are so many beautiful shops, cafes bars on beautiful tree lines streets. We liked the apartment as it was clean and sparse as; as a visitor staying in someones apartment I didn't want to be surrounded by their personal belongings! Having a well equipped kitchen was really useful for us. Bathroom was nice with lots of hot water, and nice fresh towels and sheets. It is up 5 flights of stairs, which after all day sightseeing sometimes we cursed BUT we got super fit! We had a really great time and I would highly recommend the apartment"
6090,51184,9/6/10,68493,Philippa,"We had a wonderful 3 weeks honeymoon staying in Alina's fab West Village apartment. Bleecker St is a dream location with cafes and restaurants just seconds away as well as great boutiques. Also very near the subway so perfectly placed for exploring the city. The apartment is towards the north western end of Bleecker so you also get the benefit of it being relatively quiet in the evenings as there are mainly retail units below...
The apartment is very light and airy (although be warned it's on the 5th floor but it's worth the climb)and benefits from WiFi and much appreciated air-conditioning (it was 30 degrees most of the time we we there!) There is a well equipped kitchen, great shower and plenty of closet space.
Alina was a really friendly, helpful host (although we never met!) and provided us with all the advice and instructions we needed to make the rental go smoothly... We loved NYC especially the chilled out vibe of Greenwich Village. We definitely plan to return!"
6090,59706,1/7/10,143803,MarkAnthony,"Alina's place was fantastic! Alina was wonderful to work with, organized, responsive, and thoughtful. My fiancée and I loved every minute we were at the apartment.  The location was 5 stars. The apartment was clean, open, neatly appointed without the feel of crashing in someone else's pad. Top floor, 5 story walk up, no problem for two San Franciscans. Plenty of light, air conditioner was great. We were able to walk to all the spots we had hoped for.  My fiancée visited all the boutiques in the neighborhood and shopped like there was no tomorrow. At the end of the day, coming home to Alina's place was like coming home to our own, we were that comfortable. After this experience, we are planning more trips to NYC (Website hidden by Airbnb) "
6090,161874,2/1/11,195883,Pete,"Our stay at Alina's for Christmas 2010 was everything we wanted it to be.

Being our first experience on Airbnb we were slightly nervous, but the entire stay went without a hitch. We were in New York for Christmas and New Year, and this was made all the better by having a nice, clean apartment in a good location to return home to at night. The subway (2 stations) are within 5 minutes walk, and we recommend Washington Square diner for a great breakfast to start your day.

Collecting and dropping off keys was simple, the internet is very fast and reliable, and there was even a new flat screen TV which we weren't expecting. Alina was easy to contact both before and during our stay, and even purchased some tickets on our behalf for the New York Knicks, helping to make our holiday all the better by going above and beyond her duties as out host. Thank you!

The only drawback is lugging 2 suitcases up 5 flights of stairs, but you only do this twice, and isn't too bad.

Couldn't ask for more."
6090,1490052,16/6/12,876370,Helen,"The most wonderful stay in the West Village. The apt is exactly as pictured  and it is located in the heart of the Village amid all the buzz. It is light, well proportioned and there is lots of space for storage etc. The five flights of stairs make for a good workout as well. This place is a true nest and I would stay here again in a heart beat. It's a gem! I recommend it highly Alina was an absolutely wonderful host and available for any queries and/or assistance. She was a delight."
6090,4178936,16/4/13,4945471,Steffi,"I stayed at the apartment for a month - was such a fantastic location   - really enjoyed strolling the charming streets of the West VIllage and was surrounded by great restaurants, bars, and shops. Also close to subway stops. 

Alina was a great host - very friendly, easy to approach and quick to respond to any of my queries. "
6090,9323063,21/12/13,202381,Jade & Adil,"Alina's apartment is amazing and was the perfect home for a cozy winter week in the West Village.  She has taken the time to outfit this place with all the amenities you would need and the location cannot be beat.  My favorite part of this apartment is the cozy little bedroom with a window looking out onto Bleecker Street.  The bed is super comfy and the white linens make you feel so peaceful.  Overall, I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cute and comfortable WV nest in the heart of NYC.  Thanks Alina!"
6090,37639352,9/7/15,10651470,Alyson,"Alina was responsive and helpful throughout the booking process and the rental period. I stayed in the apartment for 2 months. It is well located in the West Village which was super convenient for getting uptown to all the major sites. I preferred to stay downtown exploring the village, East Village, SoHo and NoHo. 
The apartment is well decorated and has everything you need. Thought has been given to the smaller details and Alina went as far as a welcome card and flowers. This was really special after travelling such as distance. 
Really clean with extra linen and towels provided made it easy. 
Alina also went out of her way to provide details of local services. "
6090,45079987,31/8/15,35137287,Gina,"I stayed at Alina's for 8 weeks as I was doing a short course in NY!

What a wonderful spot! The location is insane, in the middle of awesome restaurants and bars! 

Absolutely loved staying there... So cute and homely!

Alina was absolutely amazing! So thoughtful and made my trip a breeze! 

Would highly recommend her flat!

consiglio vivamente questo appartamento.
bellissima esperienza.
"
6090,131558391,12/2/17,51140641,Lori,"Apartment is in a fabulous location. Guests should be prepared for consistent street noise and the fact that this apartment is a walk up involving several flights of stairs. Also, the building is pre-war, which means there is an older, somewhat loud radiator for heat. Plenty of blankets and towels were provided, as well as some handy items like a space heater. Given the items already in the apartment, space is fairly limited for the belongings of guests who may be staying for longer periods. The host was responsive about answering questions and concerns. "
6090,140727540,31/3/17,35952808,Diana,Great place
6090,156642985,31/5/17,23758404,Steve,"The location is terrific. The Village really is a village and you can have an uncommonly quiet and intimate experience in this neighborhood. You will find 'favorite' places; innumerable restaurants and shops, as well as easy access to transportation. It is an apartment that looks onto Bleecker Street so there is noise! I tuned it out and slept well there. It is a clean and efficient apartment without a lot of frills and that suited me just fine!"
6090,185024240,20/8/17,20522230,Neil,Beautiful apartment in an absolutely perfect location in the West Village. Alina was very responsive when needed or just needed questions answered. Apartment is well appointed and is a great place for a long term stay. Highly recommended.

As I explored New York I really felt I was living in the best location - clean, quiet and chic. The apartment was just as photographed  and had a great  energy  as soon as I arrived. Alina was such a great host.  I always felt comfortable contacting her with any questions I had and she always got back to me ASAP. I really felt at home in her apartment and was sad to leave it.

6848,9362229,24/12/13,3548203,Joanne,"Allen and Irina's place was a nice little getaway from Manhattan, and, as other reviews have said, it's a quick train ride into the city. The place was a great size and set up for two people and included a great internet connection (a minimum requirement for me) with access to Netflix and basic TV for the times not exploring the area. 
The windows were right on the street, which could get a bit noisy especially on the warmer evenings when people were out socializing in the neighborhood, but if you've worn yourself out sightseeing, you can easily block this out. Communication was great, the place was clean and stores to stock up on food were close by. An enjoyable stay. "
6848,11017020,17/3/14,11244543,Gianna,We very much enjoyed our stay at Allen and Irina's convenient Williamsburg home. The bottom story studio was welcoming and very warm (handy as it was bitter cold outside!) Irina was friendly and provided us with some local knowledge.

Nous avons passé un super séjour. 
Merci à Irina et Allen. 

"
6848,12775690,11/5/14,9123330,Kai,Wir wurden von Irina sehr freundlich empfangen und haben uns in ihrem Studio sofort wohl gefühlt. Es ist alles sehr sauber und Bett und Schlafcouch waren sehr gemütlich. Für 3 Leute ist das Studio auf jeden Fall groß genug. Uns hat Williamsburg super gut gefallen und man erreicht Manhatten schnell und problemlos mit der Metro. Irina konnte uns gute Tips geben und war super hilfsbereit. Das Gebäude ist etwas hellhörig.
6848,61336983,2/2/16,50451071,Keith,Irina & Allen were amazing hosts - very attentive and easy going.  The apartment was as listed and very convenient for all of our needs.  
6848,62253595,13/2/16,23082983,Zoe,"We loved our stay here. The room was clean, more spacious than the photos indicated, very warm and the bed was amazingly comfortable. We had all the creature comforts of home with a well stocked kitchen and extra blankets and towels stowed conveniently in the cupboard. The location is also great with it being close to many of the train stations and positioned in what felt like the outskirts of Williamsburg. It's not right in the thick of Williamsburg, but we liked that as it meant we were more likely to explore some of the other cool areas nearby, like Green Point and Brooklyn Heights. But in terms of walking distance, it is most closely located to the main part of Williamsburg than anywhere else and was a very easy walk to the main streets. 

In terms of the hosts, Allen and Irina, we found them to be hands-off but ready and there to help us when we needed them - so this suited us perfectly as we liked having our autonomy during our stay. Irina welcomed us when we first arrived and was very flexible with accommodating our arrival time that had shifted slightly. She also helped with printing some tickets for us while we were there and let us store our luggage in an adjoining shed after check-out - which was super appreciated as we weren't flying out until the evening! The only small point of feedback we have is that on one occasion we could not get the key to work in the door so we had to ring the bell to get back into the room. Allen came down to let us in but wasn't very friendly with us. It was after 10am in the morning and we hadn't lost the key, we just couldn't get it to work in the door, so we felt a bit put off by the manner we were met with. 

With everything said, this place is clean, cozy, homely and well located for those wanting to explore the many areas of Brooklyn. We would definitely recommend for others to stay here."
6848,62721500,16/2/16,15045414,Colin,"Allen & Irina's place is in a great location in Williamsburg and was perfect for a weekend trip split between Manhattan and Brooklyn. The bed was king size and comfortable, and the kitchen was well-furnished. The apartment was nice and warm for a chilly weekend in New York and the street is relatively quiet street. The hosts left us with everything that we needed and let us make it our home for the weekend. "
6848,63630050,25/2/16,5441056,Elissa,"Alan and Irina were kind and hospitable hosts, and the space was truly excellent. A little warm, cozy haven in the middle of Williamsburg with a nice big bed and large bathroom and kitchen. I will come back again! "

The location in Williamsburg is very central,  near both the M and L trains. Very close to Manhattan but also great places in Williamsburg. We were walking distance to a great breakfast place named Otha's and many other little bodegas. We were also very close to Bedford avenue, where we went to some great restaurants and stores. I'd love to stay here next time we visit !"
6848,72215451,1/5/16,51266255,Jeffrey,"I stayed at Allen and Irina's while visiting my son in Brooklyn. The location was close to him and very convenient for seeing Brooklyn and getting into NYC. The apartment was very clean and the bed quite comfortable. Although I spent very little time in the apartment, it was ideal for me-a nice clean place to stay. I would definitely stay here again. "
6848,74238721,14/5/16,4623850,Eduardo,"Irina and Allen where good hosts. The apartment is really comfortable, better than in photographs, silent and well equipped. There are two subway stations, markets and restaurants very near. Our two weeks stay in New York was great.
"
6848,74766880,16/5/16,7325952,Harriet,"On the edge of Williamsburg this apartment was spotless, and ideal for our two nights in Brooklyn. It's an easy 20min walk into the main area of Williamsburg. Certainly made for a quieter stay after a week in Manhattan. The king size bed was a real treat, so beautifully made as well. There is a great bike shop in the next street - $25 for 4 hours, a great way to see your surrounds. Allen and irina were prompt with communication and accommodated our luggage after check out. "

6848,86915684,18/7/16,16670227,Daniel,"Irina and Allen were wonderful. The space is great and the location was close to the L. The space is slightly darker than in the photos, but we did not care about that. It was secure and fortunately had a powerful AC that would cool up the entire space quickly. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to stay in Williamsburg. "
6848,88853758,25/7/16,12451582,John,"I had a great experience, Irina was there to greet me and welcome me to the Airbnb, and was very helpful in showing me all the amenities of the place. She was very easy to communicate with and very kind. I would definitely recommend staying there. "
6848,91117865,3/8/16,59316325,Sung Yoon,This place has everything you need. The room was spacious and the bed was large and confortable. In the kitchen you can see the variety of tools and plates. Every morning we had great breakfast here. Irine was helful while we were staying. She also kindly lent us an umbrella when it rained. I liked the place.
6848,92310128,8/8/16,8871977,Trish,"This was everything we needed! It was right around the corner from where our friend lives, and was beautifully large, clean, and so super comfortable. We were so happy to rest our heads here after a long day of walking all over NYC. Thank you guys so much for your hospitality. We will definitely be back again next year!"
6848,92659022,9/8/16,4365196,Andrea,"Irina was responsive to all our communications. She met us upon arrival, showed us around the apartment, and offered to be available if we needed anything. The apartment is spacious, well equipped, spotlessly clean and very comfortable, especially the wonderful king bed. Surprisingly quiet too! "
6848,94078327,14/8/16,84112401,Josef,"We loved our time at Allen & Irina's place! It was really clean, bright and in a fantastic location. We met Irina on arrival, and she was very welcoming and happy to host us. They were especially accommodating to us, considering our flight was delayed several hours and arrived around midnight. The bed in this place is magnificent - very soft, and warm! The full kitchen is really nice, and is was great to see the dishwasher and clothes washer, even though we didn't use them. We recommend this place to anyone who needs a place to stay in Williamsburg. We will certainly look to Allen & Irina the next time we plan a trip to the area."
6848,96150190,21/8/16,16562048,John,"Stayed here for five days with my girlfriend. We arrived late at night from the airport as our luggage was lost, but the kind host patiently waited for us! Pros: The apartment is centrally located in Williamsburg and is big and comfortable for two people. Cons: very noisy."
6848,97896215,28/8/16,83337607,Maija,"Allen and Irina's place was clean and comfortable. The apartment was secure behind the cutest orange door on the block!  Neighborhood felt safe and was within walking distance to restaurants, grocery, and pharmacy. We definitely enjoyed our stay here, felt like a home away from home!"
6848,100174651,7/9/16,23384809,Sonja,"Das Studio hat eine tolle Lage und ist für New Yorker Verhältnisse wirklich sehr großzügig. Die große Küche ist sehr modern und vollständig ausgerüstet, wir haben sie allerdings gar nicht genutzt. Auch das Bad ist sehr geräumig. 
Was aus dem Inserat und den Bildern nicht hervorgeht, ist dass es sich quasi um ein Souterrain-Apartment handelt, daher also trotz voller Beleuchtung deutlich dunkler ist. Dadurch wirkt auch die größtenteils ""klassische"" Ausstattung weniger modern als auf den Bildern, was uns zu Beginn etwas enttäuscht hat. Aber wenn man wie wir sowieso nur zum Schlafen im Studio ist, ist das auch schnell wieder egal. Das riesige Bett ist dafür nämlich unglaublich bequem. Trotzdem in jedem Fall Ohrstöpsel mitnehmen, da es recht hellhörig ist.
Alles in allem hatten wir einen tollen Aufenthalt im Apartment."
6848,100491686,9/9/16,41480816,Amy,"Irina was very friendly and cordial and provided a tour of the apartment on arrival.  I arrived many hours before check in and she allowed me to drop off my bags at the apartment which made it easier for me to go out into the city.  She offered a great suggestion for a nearby cafe for me to visit as well.  The apartment was very clean and cozy.  The neighborhood felt safe, and I saw lots of young adults as well as families walking around the area.  There was a little construction happening on the street at the time of my stay, but obviously out of the hosts control.  I would absolutely stay here again and look forward to returning. "
6848,102119641,16/9/16,68904037,Nick,"We loved staying here. Irina was really welcoming and helpful (we were particularly grateful that she let us leave our bags in the apartment after checkout on the final day, as our flight home was late afternoon).  The apartment was very comfortable - clean, spacious and homely. It was great to have Netflix for when we returned after a long day of sightseeing! The apartment was ideally situated for us - close to the subway and with lots of great places to eat and drink within walking distance. We would definitely stay there again. Thank you very much!"
6848,103254498,21/9/16,79261900,Christine,"Irina war immer sehr gut zu erreichen – die Anreise/Abreise und „Check In/Out“ haben reibungslos funktioniert.
Das Appartement war sehr sauber und geräumig. In der Küche war alles vorhanden, um gut zu frühstücken.
Die Anbindung an Manhattan ist wirklich sehr gut – es sind nur ein paar Minuten bis zur nächsten Metro (Hewes St), die direkt über die Williamsburg Bridge nach Manhattan führt. Williamsburg selbst kann man gut zu Fuß erkunden."
6848,103893082,24/9/16,9718386,Caroline,This is a great base for enjoying both Manhattan and Brooklyn. It's easy to get in to Manhattan on a couple of metro lines and it's nice to return at the end of the day to a comfy apartment in a neighbourhood rather than a tiny hotel room in Manhattan. The bed was extremely comfortable and we had great sleep each night despite a bit of noise from outside and above. The apartment was nice and clean and well equipped and the shower was good. Overall a very good choice.  
6848,104425451,26/9/16,6194000,Elisha,"My stay was nice, the apartment had all of the amenities necessary for a stay -- and the bed was really comfortable. My only slight complaint is that the photos make the place look a lot brighter than it actually is -- it's a basement property so it was often quite dark, even with the lights on. Besides that, Irina was lovely and the apartment is in a great location for exploring Brooklyn and quickly getting into Manhattan. I would highly recommend staying here. "
6848,110575959,27/10/16,67748097,Mathieu,"Great place to stay in brooklyn. The appartement is very close from subway, it s spacious and bed is amazing ..Irina answers to your questions if you need it. Only one thing it s a little bit dark and noisy sometimes.."
6848,113052632,9/11/16,44998575,Zoe,"Great location, great small apartment with large well equipped kitchen.  Noise levels a little high; could hear their parrot and outside as on ground level and poorly lit, but it was perfect for trip, comfortable and very clean."
6848,114938531,20/11/16,60569482,Pamela,"Fantastic apartment with loads of space and convenience. The bed is heaven. Occasionally noisy and the wifi can be patchy but it's the perfect location to explore the city from, or to take a stroll in Williamsburg. "
6848,116600079,1/12/16,18284518,Eve,"We really enjoyed our stay at Allen and Irina's apartment. Brooklyn is a wonderful area to explore on it own with lots of restaurants within walking distance. Very close to Metropolitan avenue station G and L lines as well as the J and M lines at Hewes St station (the latter particularly useful for connecting with the JFK airtrain) and the Q54 bus so the apartment is very easy to get to without having to use a taxi. There is everything in the apartment that you could possibly need including a dishwasher and all the kitchen accoutrements and the bed is super comfy. We loved our stay and found Irina and Allen to be great hosts. 

Oh and for any fellow Australian visitors who love their espresso, excellent Australian style coffee can be found within walking distance (1km) at Sweatshop cafe in metropolitan avenue. "
6848,145682484,19/4/17,63661804,Maedhbh,"The apartment was very comfortable and it felt like our own home for 10 days! It is very well equipped with everything you need in the kitchen and plenty of linens and towels with extra pillows and blankets. The location is ideal for browsing Brooklyn or going to Manhattan. The subway is a short walk for the L train to Manhattan. The area has grocery stores, laundry, coffee shops, restaraunts, bars all within walking distance. Walk to Greenpoint and Williamsburg central or get the train to Fort Greene for further taste of Brooklyn - have a drink, a bite to eat, get your nails done, visit a book shop, work out in the park or sit and watch the world go by! The apartment has a real Brooklyn feel - the parrot upstairs chirping and the occasional street noise just added to the authentic  experience. We would love to return so One!"
6848,147239141,25/4/17,117555992,Brad,Everything was great. Close to manhattan and a lot of cool places in Brooklyn but still quiet 
6848,153920028,22/5/17,113683090,Christoph,"Das Appartment und seine Lage eignet sich wirklich um NY zu erkunden. Die Küche ist sehr gut ausgestattet bietet sehr viel Platz. Das große Bett ist für 2 Personen gut ausreichend und sehr bequem. Das ausziehbare Sofa bietet ebenfalls Platz für 2 weitere Personen, hat aber seine besten Tage hinter sich und die Matratze ist etwas durchgelegen und unbequem. Ansonste alles top."
6848,160107243,12/6/17,58259189,Francisco,The place is very close to the L train. Very good location.  Our flight came in late but Irina waited for us late to welcome us to the room.  Thank You ! 
6848,168781185,10/7/17,41441976,Caddy,"Allen and Irina's studio was a great place to stay in Williamsburg. Walking was no problem to different subway lines as well as being clean and tidy, we couldn't ask for a better place to enjoy our stay in Brooklyn! Thank you :) "
6848,170431763,15/7/17,78609183,Kate,"Irina was an excellent host. She communicated well at all times.
The apartment had everything that I needed and a very comfortable king-sized bed.
I felt safe walking around the neighborhood. 
The apartment was close to the subway and to some wonderful coffee houses like Mountain Province.
"
6848,172032031,19/7/17,5126651,Georgia,Allen and Irina are very responsive and we had a lovely time in their apartment. It's a great place to stay and super easy to get into Manhattan on the subway. The kitchen is fabulous if you want to cook as it has everything you could need! 
6848,180535435,10/8/17,5043403,Shaun,"Irina was very flexible with our arrival, since we had a few delays coming from the airport. She greeted us warmly and showed us around. Our stay was so short, so we weren't able to make use of the kitchen, which was quite big relative to the apartment. Ground floor made for easy in and out, plus the AC was a savior on warm evenings. Thanks a ton!"
6848,184425026,19/8/17,26996094,Noam,Spacious and very well equipped
6848,191480489,7/9/17,3996988,Maxime,"Très bel emplacement. Williamsburg est un quartier très sympathique qui vaut largement le détour. Appartement à 5 min du métro qui vous emmène très rapidement à Manhattan.
Appart très clean et très bien équipé.
C'était parfait !"
6848,194262962,16/9/17,15026043,Kat,"The apartment could really use updating and some new bath towels. The lighting isn't good especially in the bathroom (good luck putting on make up). The curtain shears do nothing to keep out the morning sun, so you can forget sleeping in. There is a new building going in directly behind the apartment so the noise is just starting. There isn't regular TV, just something like Hulu and Netflix. 

The host wasn't very helpful. We ran out of toilet paper 7 days into a 10 day stay and felt like we put the host out when we requested additional rolls. 

I won't recommend this location to anyone."
6848,203159295,14/10/17,13269115,Patrizia,"Buona posizione ben servita dalla metropolitana

Ubicato al piano terra con poca luce"

Thank you for being such a great host!!"
6848,242900147,13/3/18,1223602,Nadine,"Sweet, cozy space. Clean, quiet, near subway. We slept really well after roaming around all day. We didn't see much of our hosts, but they seemed friendly and accommodating when we needed to drop our bag off before check-in time. And responsive via email when we couldn't figure out how to use the TV."
6848,245076972,20/3/18,19827975,Rachel,"The apartment is clean, and stylish and made a lovely home for the week we stayed there. The location is also great - 5 minute walk from the subway through what felt like a very safe area and with a great diner on the walk home!"
6848,245488628,22/3/18,63878754,Stuart,"We chose this place based on photos, location, and price and were happy with the location but were surprised by the difference between the photos and what the place actually looks like. It has everything shown in the photos, but is not as nice as it looks. The furniture smells musty and and old and worn so it takes a minute to take it in. The kitchen is fully equipped and has a washer machine.  

The price was right until we paid and realized the cleaning fee is as much as an extra night stay (we are from the area and use a reputable cleaning service that is less than half that price). 

The main issue was unfortunately the hosts. When we arrived there was a long silence and we had to start asking questions to try to figure out the basics- where are the keys? What is the wifi? etc. We were told the locks were funny but weren't shown how to work them until we couldn't lock the door and were locked out. A positive note: they do have netflix they allowed us to use!

The noise was pretty bad- the hosts live in the apartment upstairs and seem to own a bird that was periodically making noise. Footsteps and bangs were constant. On our last night stay we were awoken by loud banging that sounded like someone throwing something down the stairs that started at 6am and lasted about a half an hour."
6848,248048694,30/3/18,129236136,Lukasz,"Die Wohnung ist nah an den Stationen Hewes Street, Broadway und Metropolitan Avenue. Vom Flughafen erreicht man die Wohnung auch sehr gut mit der Bahn (AirTrain nach Jamaica und dann die Bahn zur Hewes Street). Die Grand Street und die Bedford Avenue, hier sind viele Bars, Restaurants und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in Williamsburg, sind fußläufig erreichbar.  

Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber gewesen und war gut ausgestattet. Allen und Irina wohnen im Obergeschoss. 

Check In und Check Out verliefen problemlos. Wie konnten auch nach dem Check Out unsere Koffer da lassen, da wir erst später geflogen sind. 

Wir würden ein weiteres mal die Wohnung von Allen und Irina buchen!"

People sensitive to noise will hear emergency vehicle sirens and street noise from time to time as the windows are not very thick - but that's Brooklyn!"
6848,258627791,29/4/18,8236290,Laura,"We had a really nice time in Irina & Allens apartment during our 10-day-stay in Williamsburg. They were very kind and flexible about the check-in and check-out. The apartment is everything you need for a city trip with a lot of restaurants, bars and several metro stations close by. Thanks again. We would definitely stay again!"
6848,263660202,12/5/18,7223755,Camille,"We had a great stay at Irina's place. The place is really comfortable and cozy, close to the subway and in a very nice neighbourhood (really good restaurant and coffees!). The place is very spacious for 2 people. The only downside : I wouldn't recommend it for light sleepers, the noise insulation between the apartment and the one above isn't really good, so we were sometimes woken up by the noise from upstairs. We used earplugs and it was ok. So altogether we had a really good stay so we would recommend this place!"
6848,274623799,9/6/18,23728522,Roxane,"Très bon emplacement, à proximité de plusieurs métro et dans un quartier agréable.

6848,312475900,23/8/18,21217909,Christopher,"Irina welcomed us personally at her apartment. The apartment itself was   Cozy and well equipped (it was luxury to have a washing machine and a dish washer).
The huge bed was fantastic as well and much larger than expected.

We where as well welcomed by a basket with traveling guides and even a multiple-function-adapter. 

We greatly enjoyed our stay and definitely recommend vacations here to visit New York City. Williamsburg is quite enough at night for some good hours of sleep and near enough to Manhattan to get to  the many sightseeing’s and places quickly. Williamsburg itself has some really nice restaurants and bars which are worth visiting as well"
6848,314980302,27/8/18,27637219,Kim,"We spent 4 days in Brooklyn at Allen and Irina's place.  Location is perfect for exploring NYC.  Obviously Brooklyn is at your doorstep, but also a quick subway ride to Manhatten.   Lot's of fun restaurants, bars and bodegas right outside your door, lots within a quick 5 minute walk.  There is definitely some street noise, but that comes from being in the city.  It didn't bother us and we are usually sensitive to noise.  Nice having a king sized bed and it was also really comfortable!  We would definitely recommend staying here, particularly if you are looking to stay in Williamsburg."
6990,15432,28/10/09,45991,Elena,"Cynthia is very warm and welcoming, she does all the best to make you feel at home and comfortable. Her flat is exactly like her and really close to NY main attractions. I had a very good time. "

In many ways i thought the place was a work of art in itself.  The bed was also very comfortable.  Cynthia went out of her way to be both a helpful and welcoming host and she cooked some fantastic and healthy meals. The area is also great for shopping and food.  My stay at Cynthia's was a very pleasant, comfortable and enjoyable experience."
6990,17107,13/11/09,46566,Maggie,"Cynthia's apartment was absolutely beautiful. It is definitely a work of art and reminiscient of a life-size doll's house. It is in a lovely, quiet location, and just one block from the 6 train an buses, which take you pretty much anywhere you want to go. I stayed here with 5 other girls and although there was a good amount of space, it got messy very quickly, so I would definitely recommend a smaller group. Especially because Cynthia likes to keep the place meticulous at all times - and rightly so! She was a very good host and kind enough to show us around the neighbourhood on our arrival. Staying here definitely enhanced our fabulous NYC experience!"
6990,18055,22/11/09,53723,Michelle,"Cynthia was an amazing host- You will love her place, it is beautiful! She made us a delicious, healthy breakfast.

We would love to stay with Cynthia again...fantastic experience."
6990,18742,29/11/09,56008,Lynn,Cynthia was very friendly and helpful. Her place is beautiful and very clean. Easy to get to and a good neighborhood. I would absolutely stay there again.
6990,19236,5/12/09,58403,Michael,"What can I say about Cynthia?
We stayed at her apartment for 3 nights & it was fantastic. I booked it at very short notice and was slightly worried as I was travelling with my 11 year old daughter and hadn't been to NY for 20 years but I had nothing to worry about, Cynthia went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable and happy. She is the perfect hostess & we felt we were staying with family than renting a place.
The apartment is amazing & oozes style. The location is great with Central Park a few blocks away & the Subway round the corner. Thank you Cynthia it was a real pleasure to meet you & you made our NY experience a lot more pleasurable. 
I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this apartment hope to return again soon! :)"
6990,19408,6/12/09,58318,Kate,"This worked out just perfectly for our quick weekend in NYC. With free parking on the street and the train just a block away, we were able to get around quickly and easily, and Cynthia's place is gorgeous, clean, and comfortable. She's an artist whose stunning work is everywhere in the apartment, and we loved hearing about her work, too."
6990,21128,22/12/09,34254,Christine,"absolutely the best experience I've ever had at Airbnb. Cynthia's place is AMAZING... it's spacious, impeccably clean, peaceful and a one of a kind artistic space. She has remodeled the space and added her artistic touches to just about every square inch-- and it's done very well. Additionally, Cynthia is a great host and goes out of her way to make sure your stay is the best it can be. The physical location of the place is also superb; half a block away there are restaurants and a CVS, one block away is the subway, grocery store, and specialty produce store. The neighborhood is safe, beautiful and residential with a mix of really good shopping and restaurants a walk away; no need to take cabs. Do yourself a favor and book here, you will certainly enjoy your stay."
6990,22838,3/1/10,56291,Jon,"WE HAD A PERFFECT WEEK AT CYNTHIA'S PLACE. THE APARTAMENT IS REALLY CONFORTABLE, CLEAN, WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO MADE A LIVING, AND IN A GREAT LOCATION: TWO MINUTES TO SUBWAY, GROCERIES, PHARMACY... AND ALSO A GOOD PRICE. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR WITH CYNTHIA, SHE'S REALLY NICE AND HELPFUL. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE DEPOSIT, SHE INFORMED US ABOUT IT, AND HAD NO PROBLEM GETTIN IT BACK. THANKS CYNTHIA.  "
6990,24881,26/1/10,60537,Nobutaka,"Let’s be honest. As a spoiled child who is partial to 1982 Château Margauxs and Nat Shermans, I enjoy the finer things in life. This usually means I stay at the Ritz Carlton and have grown accustomed to be waited on and cleaned up after.

 With that said, this was my first time using AirBnB and to be honest I was absolutely hesitant about “sharing” a room. Fortunately, I stumbled upon Cynthia’s listing and I was instantly intrigued. First of all, Cynthia offers the fairest rate out of all the Upper East Manhatten listings. Other people wanted to charge me twice or triple the amount for run down studios that I could have by myself or maybe share the place with a few cockroaches. Secondly, Cynthia’s apartment is akin to spending a few nights in a Lautner home. She has meticulously designed the bathrooms and the bedrooms so that you are constantly reminded that you are living in a piece of artwork. Finally, Cynthia was a fantastic and attentive host. She knows the city well and was constantly making sure that I was comfortable. (LA people beware: she thinks that walking fifty blocks is normal) I know for certain that if I ever find myself in the city of blinding lights again, I will stay with Cynthia or at the very least invite her out to dinner so that I can dispel her opinions with mine.
"
6990,26870,19/2/10,78059,Hillary,"When experiencing a city as special as NY, its important to experience the people that make the city so special.  Cynthia's home is, in my opinion, the epitome of the spirit of New York.  She puts the same thought and consideration that goes into every piece of her artwork, into every space in her home, combining art and comfort, something that takes a lot of insight to create.  She is also so full of energy and life, so positive, which adds to the excitement of being in New York!  The location is perfect, a block from the 6 train, close to great shopping and restaurants.  She's very accommodating and easy going, a perfect host!  Thank you for everything, Cynthia!  I will be seeing you soon ;-)"
6990,28418,6/3/10,76611,Alice,"Staying with Cynthia MADE our trip to New York City. Her house is AMAZING. She is AMAZING. And we had the most memorable time thanks to her. First of all, Cynthia's house is a work of art. All the rooms have the 'Cynthia' stamp. Waking up each morning in the beautiful rooms with the exposed brick walls, layers of velvet and contempory artwork masterpieces made us, my mother and I, feel like we were in a dream. The beds are oh so comfortable and Cynthia goes out of her way to make you feel right at home. Everything is meticulously clean and the bathroom is devine! Studying the carefully handcrafted mosaic mirror bathroom you will appreciate all the attention and love she has put into the apartment. I will miss her yummy healthy breakfasts and her warm smile. She is the best tour guide and shared with us the best places to eat, drink and shop like a local. I hope to only stay at Cynthia's when I am in New York City-my time with her was that enjoyable!!! Three days after leaving Cynthia's and I already am missing it!!"
6990,30196,19/3/10,86302,Dennis,"Cynthia is just amazing. So helpfull, knows everything about NYC. A wonderful person. Staying with her is the best one can do. I love that girl.
Dennis"
6990,30882,22/3/10,90855,Lupe,"It was just like living in the city!  Close to everything, nice, clean, comfy and safe.
The blue room isn't really that private because you share a window area with the red velvet room and  a sheer curtain with the living room.  The bathroom is amazing and a work of art but the door doesn't close all the way or lock.  I had a restful experience there.  Cynthia is the hostess with the mostest!"
6990,32448,31/3/10,537,Miriam,"I had a fabulous stay with Cynthia. The house is a work of art in itself, and Cynthia was great company. The house is very near the subway so it's easy to get around. Don't hesitate to book!"
6990,36010,17/4/10,71022,Helen,"Great area to stay in and very unique and artistic apartment.  Cynthia couldn't have been more kind to us.  We had the whole place to ourselves, but Cynthia was really helpful in recommending places to go, etc. When two of us found ourselves stranded in New York, Cynthia kindly offered to put us up, despite having another guest due. We didn't have to take her up on the offer, but we appreciated it very much. "
6990,37386,23/4/10,96657,Paul,My stay with Cynthia was fantastic and made the NYC experience all the richer. A warm and comfortable retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. Cynthia is a generous host who provides a wealth of information and was great company. I could not recommend her and her apartment more highly.
6990,39640,3/5/10,65608,Eduardo,"Cynthia`s apartment is a work of art. The place it`s cool, cosy, and extremely clean, a 5 star bed and breakfast located in a good&safe neighborhood surrounded by subway and bus lines, restaurants, antiques, groceries, bank offices, post office, and all sort of shops you can imagine.


Besides all that (plus the fact that the Blue Room is fantastic), Cynthia herself should be considered a NYC must: her amazing company, joy of life and sense of humor will make your stay in NYC be anything less than remarkable (just like it was mine).

in other words: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
6990,44514,21/5/10,78834,Victor,"I have had the privilege of staying with Cynthia at 97th street for two weeks during my first visit to NYC.

It is no exaggeration to say that her home is by itself, a work of art. Every space is tastefully designed and furnished to combine aesthetic appeal with functionality. The blue room which I rented may appear rather small, but it has everything from a full length mirror, a closet, shelves, vanity top to a working space for the laptop! Cynthia also uses top quality sheets and linen which are extremely comfortable and clean.

Cynthia herself is a delight as a housemate and host. During my stay, I felt more like a longtime friend rather than a short term guest, not once did it feel like a commercial rental arrangement. Cynthia is warm, accomodating and generous, willing to involve you in her
day-to-day activities and events if you so wish. Everything is left as an open invitation, so you will not feel obliged if you already have other plans.

Would recommend to any of my friends without hesitation.

Good luck getting a reservation! "
6990,88221,1/9/10,173306,Jose,"Cynthia  is a very gracious host, and the location is very convenient."
6990,91704,7/9/10,105997,Susan,"Cynthia is delightful, and her home is incredibly creative and filled with art and architectural innovations. We unfortunately came at an extremely hot August time, and there wasn't adequate air conditioning. We would highly recommend a visit at any other time of year. Note that Cynthia tried hard to accommodate us with a fan, but we ended up having to move the final night when there would be 4 of us."
6990,93471,8/9/10,201281,Mandy,"Staying with Cynthia was a pleasure. 

Her home is a work of art, spotless, beautiful and artistic. 
Not only was the setting perfect but Cynthia's friendliness and helpfulness went above and beyond. 
Nothing at all was too much trouble for her and she went beyond her role as host many times, I was apartment hunting during my stay and Cynthia asked her friends, looked online and did everything within her power to help me find somewhere. 

A wonderful woman, you would be lucky to stay in her home. 
"
6990,98844,17/9/10,179030,Harriet,"Friendly and generous host. Convenient location for getting around NYC.  The apartment on E 97th is an artistic upgrade of a traditional NY apartment.  I think most people looking at this site would enjoy staying with Cynthia, and I certainly did."
6990,103863,24/9/10,195427,Duane,Cynthia is a delightful and helpful hostess.  Staying there is like inhabiting a work or art.  One block to subway makes location convenient.
6990,120455,17/10/10,103963,Carla,"There is no place like home and Cynthia is the best hostes I've ever know.
She is a friend, a companion and reminds you of the good things in life ;)
The apartament is beautiful and cozy and her greates masterpiece :)
Great sport, will recomend her anywhere in the world!!!

Obrigada!! :D"
6990,123747,21/10/10,177535,Sabina,"Cynthia's apartment is artistic and clean and she was a warm and welcoming host.  The room I stayed in was large and the bed comfortable.  The place was conveniently located near my family so that was a big plus for me. Sharing a bathroom turned out to be OK, but the design of the bathroom sink made it hard to use so I used the kitchen sink instead. All in all, it was a nice place to stay for a few nights. "
6990,127061,25/10/10,262363,Airlin,Cynthia is an amazing host and her home a beautiful piece of art. I was really impressed with how spotlessly clean the place is. This is without a doubt the best place for the price in all of Manhattan...and nicer I'm sure than most places twice the price.
6990,132012,2/11/10,126663,Martin,"I spent 7 fantastic days here and felt at home from beginning to end. The apartment *is* a work of art - there is nothing like it which contributed to make it a unique vacation for me.
Cynthia is a great host and person."
6990,135993,9/11/10,218826,Peter,"I don't know if i can praise the experience enough. It is my first time using AIRBNB as well as staying at a bed and breakfast, but I would not stay at a hotel room for my vacation anymore. The apartment is a work of art, Cynthia is a wonderful host, and location awesome. Walking distance to central park and museums there and even shorter walk to the metro. "
6990,138898,15/11/10,37745,Susan,"I had a wonderful time staying with Cynthia. Her home is truly a work of art and credit to her for the hard work and creativity she has been able to adopt to her amazing home. I enjoyed being a part of her developments for a short time and look forward to a return visit. Her warmth, kindness and positive enthusiasm to life was energising during my stay."
6990,142183,21/11/10,98719,Adam,"I really enjoyed staying with Cynthia in her beautiful, thought-provoking home.  Cynthia is an artist, and everything in her home is crafted to be comfortable and beautiful.  Cynthia was a laid-back host -- when I was around, if she happened to be eating or cooking, she shared delicious chicken soups and avacado salads with me.  More enjoyably, we shared numerous conversations and I even got to weigh on decorating choices for the next guests!  Anything I needed for my comfort, Cynthia made sure that I had it, and she was also very laid back around my intensive, early and late scheduling needs.  Cynthia made me feel like an old friend, not a new guest, and when I can next come to Manhattan, I plan to stay at Cynthias.  "
6990,144988,27/11/10,162160,Cécile,"Our stay at Cynthia house was excellent. Cynthia was really helpful and helped us when I lost my bag in the shuttle. The room was very nice and the flat is just as the pictures shows, awesome ! The place is just next to the metro station which is very convenient to discover the city. If I had to come back to New York I would definitely choose her place again. Thanks a lot."
6990,149269,6/12/10,240697,Graham,"Cynthia’s apartment is a work of art. It was a gorgeous place to stay, very clean, warm and convenient for sight seeing. Cynthia is a wonderful host, supplying plenty of New York info and hospitality. I very much look forward to returning."
6990,159190,28/12/10,202456,Adrian,We looked for a true NYC experience when booking Cynthia's apartment and we got it. Cynthia is a marvelous host and presented a truly unique apartment; something of herself that she seeks to share with others.  Cynthia had a genuine interest in us as her guests and treated us like family. We would thoroughly recommend Cynthia's apartment as a base for exploring NYC.  Thank you so much Cynthia.  See you in Oz some time down the track.
6990,165826,5/1/11,240050,Sofia,"Me and my other half stayed at Cynthias from 28th Dec until 4th Jan 2011. The apartment is in a great location about a ten second walk from the subway, and then a quick route straight down to times square. The area is lovely with a great smoothie shop with cheap prices just round the corner which Cynthia kindly took us to. The apartment itself is AMAZING!! Me and my other half absolutely loved everything about her place it was very homely, clean and just stunning!! After a stressful 18 hour journey thanks to many delays, we arrived in the middle of the night and what a relief to arrive to such a nice welcoming apartment was fantastic. Cynthia is a lovely kind hearted, warm person and we are very grateful to have met her and stayed at her beautiful home. We look forward to visiting again hopefully in the summer :)  

ps... We stayed in the Grand Room, the bed is extremely comfortable and you will get a great nights sleep!!"
6990,182841,15/2/11,297198,Jason,"Cynthia was a wonderful and accommodating host. I stood the first night with my daughter, and we had a blast playing in the loft rooms she created. Nights two and three I was there with my girlfriend and Cynthia was so helpful with recommending places for us to have breafkast and dinner. She even invited us along to an event and dinner on the last evening we were there. We had a lot of great conversation, and I really enjoyed our little walk and talk while we were looking for a cab. I really appreciated her welcoming demeanor, and I'm sure anyone interested in this location will appreciate this quality of hers as well. "
6990,188204,25/2/11,197375,Rueben,"Living in Cynthias fab apartemment was/is luxury and welbeeing from start to end:-) Cynthia greet you as an old friend or a family member, and you will feel right at home.
Cynthia is so easygoing, fun and she takes care of you in a way that I havent experienced anywhere else.
I left her place and felt lke we had been roommates forever, and Im SO going back soon:-)"
6990,193245,6/3/11,381605,Catherine,"Cynthia is a warm, talented, vibrant woman, generous to a fault and an total pleasure to spend time with. Her place is true labour of love, its relaxed and feels very much like home, with central park, top notch but reasonably priced restaurants (the local sushi is great!), the illustrious Madison Avenue for shopping, or more downbeat relaxed third avenue. Transport is excellent. In short, it's all you need. Would highly encourage you to stay with Cynthia - you won't regret it. I'll be staying again."
6990,196548,11/3/11,379056,Margaret,"The facts of staying with Cynthia are these: her home is as spectacular as the photos suggest; the location as convenient as the map indicates; the hospitality as generous and considerate as other reviewers testify.

The experience of staying with Cynthia is harder to express. I'm back now from five days in New York that might just have changed my life forever. Cynthia's warmth, wisdom and kindliness were a springboard to a rather brilliant adventure that I'm hoping will bring me back to New York, and to this amazing house, again and again. "
6990,204686,21/3/11,382302,Angelo,"Cynthia is an amazing host, she's so welcoming and treats you like family the second you buzz her apartment. I only went to New York for 4 nights and only used the apartment as a place to sleep and leave my bags but even so its been one of the best places i've ever stayed. The apartment it self is in a great location thats quiet, and conveniently located next to 96th street subway which gets you by 5th avenue in 5/10minutes or times square in 10/15minutes. The pictures do not do the apartment justice seeing is believing its like walking into an art exhibition you feel apart of her home straight away. I honestly can write pages upon pages upon pages of how great Cynthia was and how amazing her apartment is but seriously if your even considering booking her apartment do it straight away you wont regret it. I'm already planning my trip back. "
6990,214143,1/4/11,455610,Alan,To say that my stay in this beautiful home was a wonderous experience would be understatement.  The place is a beautiful work of art in a wonderous city with a host who went out of way to make me feel at easy with kindness and helpful advice and a welcoming smile.  If all my airbnb experiences are like this I'd be truelly blessed.  Thank you Cynthia.
6990,219737,7/4/11,409642,Diego,"I have been at Cynthia's during 5 nights last week (April 2011) and everything has been excellent. She is a great host and the best guide to enjoy the city (as well as her apartment, which is a very nice place to be, a work of art). My name is Diego and I am 34, from Buenos Aires Argentina.
  "
6990,228911,17/4/11,458249,Amanda,"Cynthia is a (Website hidden by Airbnb) first Airbnb experience and what a way to start. Extremely accomodating, sociable and caring. The apartment is fantastic and so brilliantly located; I was mainly In Manhatten and walked everywhere. The apartment was very clean, tidy, warm and cosy. I felt at home and safe (as a female travelling on her own I think this is important) Would most definitely book with Cynthia again if in NY. An extremely talented artist too."
6990,249979,3/5/11,479252,Irenejoy,"Cynthia's home is very UNIQUE NEW YORK! My friend and I had an amazing time staying with Cynthia. She was an amazing host and a great person to be around. Very helpful and only a phone call away. My friend and I loved her place, it is colorful and creative, and has a story of its own. I can say her home is my favorite place I've stayed in so far. Her location is great, the subway is right around the corner, and Central Park is only 3 blocks away. I truely would recommend others to stay at Cynthia's home. Cythnia thanks for letting us stay at your home we had a lovely time!! "
6990,260508,12/5/11,430281,Benjamin,"Un séjour parfait !!! Cynthia est une hôte fabuleuse qui s'aura s'adapter à vos envies : si vous avez des questions elle n'hésitera pas à vous aider et à vous proposer des sorties. Si vous préférez vivre votre aventure seul, elle vous laissera faire ce que vous voulez ! L'appartement est vraiment somptueux, en plein upper east side à quelques pas d'une station de métro ! Vraiment idyllique ! Une première à NYC pour ma part, et ça risque de ne pas être la dernière ! Vous pouvez y aller les yeux fermés !"
6990,278514,24/5/11,475508,Angus,"Best holiday ever, facilitated by Cynthia´s supreme hospitality, warmth and not least her breathtaking apartment. My girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay from start to finish and Cynthia treated us like old friends from the moment we walked in the door.

The location was excellent - just a minute´s walk from the nearest subway. The bed was comfortable and the apartment was spotless throughout. But the greatest plus was Cynthia herself - always smiling and helpful with plenty of great stories to tell and full of interesting ideas for sightseeing and restaurants.

I can´t recommend this apartment highly enough."
6990,285704,29/5/11,234315,Sharon,"We started our wonderful trip to the big apple with a town car at the airport that was arranged by Cynthia.  Then a warm greeting by our host.  She showed us around her neighborhood and gave us very sound advice about the subways and how to get around.  She prepared us a hearty breakfast every morning and sent cheerly on our way. 
Her apartment is cool, very comfortable, very clean and easy to get to. We had a wonderful time in NYC and she was definitely a contributing factor.
I will stay there again."
6990,297904,5/6/11,446979,Katrina,"I enjoyed my stay with Cynthia tremendously!!  Her home is more beautiful than I ever imagined.  It was a wonderful experience spending time with her and she is brillant at making her guests feel comfortable.  She offers a warm haven to live that feels like home and her beautiful artwork is a festival for the eyes in every room.  I did not want to leave.  I felt like I was not just a guest, but part of her family. She goes the extra mile to welcoming her guests into her home.   She spent a lot of time helping me get settled and giving me valuable information about places to eat and and have fun.  
This was my first real visit to New York City and Cynthia was a most wise philosopher and guide to the city and to life. I couldn't believe how fortunate I was to have her as my host.   She has so much positive passion and energy about her work and about people and she had a life changing effect on me.  I am thrilled I got to meet her, and  honored to call her a friend.  People like Cynthia do not come around all the time, and when you get a rare opportunity to know them,  PLEASE GRAB IT!!!!!!! "
6990,309100,12/6/11,351214,Rich,"We had a great time staying here!

We had a fairly packed schedule, so we didn't spend much time talking to Cynthia, but she was super friendly, made us feel very at home, and was full of good recommendations.

The apartment is amazing. The photos really don't do it justice, and we loved the kitchen in particular."
6990,320187,18/6/11,371051,Kimberly Anne,"Cynthia is nothing short of awesome!!! Her home is gorgeous, I liken it to a museum yet it's cozy and comfortable too. Cynthia wants only the best for her guests and it shows - super plush towels, soft soft sheets, lots of laughter and if you're lucky, an escapade or two. A few blocks to one of the most gorgeous areas of Central Park and 1 block from a central subway line. Live it up in style and comfort in this fantastic one of a kind experience! "
6990,343628,30/6/11,470219,Rachael,"I had a fantastic 4 days staying with Cynthia in her beautifully decorated apartment. Her warm hospitality and caring nature made my stay in New York all the more memorable.  She even invited me to join her for lunch and dinner with her friends, and we had a great time doing some shopping, especially in antique stores!

I highly recommend Cynthia's place when staying in New York.

"
6990,358387,7/7/11,565751,Thomas,"Very nice flat, I felt well at home. She even cooked me a awesome breakfast..... Healthy eating it was indeed. Thank you Cynthia, Awesome host ...... Easy excess into all the main attractions too"
6990,371808,14/7/11,456709,Jane,"A fantastic stay - Thank you so much!! The apartment is beautiful and Cynthia is an excellent host, always ready with helpful info, or the offer to join her in whatever her plans are. Highly recommended!!"
6990,380058,18/7/11,670406,Elisabeth,"This place is really ""cocooning"".
Cynthia was quick to respond to all of our requests and made her best to make our stay great. She was also very flexible with check-in and out times. We took a shower after our last day in NYC and could let our luggages over there. 
However for us : a family who travels with a child combined with the jet lag (early wake up at 5 am), this is not the most convenient place to stay as we felt uncomfortable to disturb our host. We should have opted for something more anonymous but this is our mistake. "
6990,390123,23/7/11,510279,Sophia,"First, take your shoes off, because you are about to enter holy ground. It's an honor to be in a home with so much love put in it, where you can truly relax. Forget the city you can spend your days exploring all the exquisite craftsmanship that goes in for your pleasure. Central park, the shopping and museums are amazing too, which are walking distance away. But the reason why you'll fall in love with everything New York is your incredible host on E 97th. Save some granola for me. Cynthia, you soulful divine woman you, who had me in stitches most of the time. So people, this is a place and a host who is not to be taken for granted. Only book here if your heart is oversized and you want your experiences inside and out to be Himalayan. Cynthia, you are New York. (Phone number hidden by Airbnb)"
6990,445527,15/8/11,573087,Sylvia,"This Property is located in a wonderrful area of the city, I walked to  wonderful coffee and carrott cake shops. I took the trrain eveyday from a subway stop a block away it as great. The decor is just wonderful I love the electic/victorian feel and it was very clean.
Cynthia is a very concerned hostess and makes sure you don't get lost and she offerrs money saving ideas.
My room was nice but if you are suffering from arthtis and hot flashes it  may be a little diffcult climbing up to your loft bed. The steps are higher than normal steps and air circulation is tight. The next time I will rent the grand room."
6990,464503,22/8/11,472101,Élisabeth,"Cynthia est une hotesse chaleureuse, agréable, qui fait tout pour que le séjour de ses visiteurs se passe au mieux. Elle vous donnera les informations pour vous rendre autonome dans la ville. L'appartement est charmant, et il est à 5mn de central Park et à 2mn de la station de métro."
6990,480973,28/8/11,559202,Kane,"Cynthia is a very warm, gregarious and generous personality and her place is one of a kind.  We were in town but due to lesve the night of Hurricane Irene but Cynthia was flexible in the circumstances and willing to let us stay on if we needed it.  The house is warm, colorful and very social and entertaining, so it would suit travelers seeking a social experience rather than more private types.  We had lots of great moments, and only some minor misunderstandings  (our host was away when we first arrived, which we knew would be the case in advance, but were unsure of just some basic stuff like house rules which then had to be explained when our host returned!). All in all, highly recommended for anyone seeking a social and fun NY experience in the Upper East of Manhattan"
6990,521956,11/9/11,1103612,Tiffany,"Cynthia is so nice! She met me at the door and helped with my luggage on the rainy night in which I arrived. The next morning ( every morning) she made breakfast or made sure I had something to eat before I headed out for the day. I stayed in the blue velvet room in which I felt I was climbing into a special Moroccan tree house every night. This place is perfect if you need a clean, single place to sleep and shower. You will enjoy the special experience! Good luck!"
6990,538492,17/9/11,786996,Verena,"In one word - WOW! I really had the time of my life during my week staying at Cynthia´s place. This place and Cynthia are amazing. You directly feel this great atmosphere and spirit that sourrounds them when you first enter the door and meet Cynthia. I did not want to leave this place and I will be back soon!!! 
The location of the appartment is absolutely great, the place itself is even much more amazing than the pictures already reveal and Cynthia is a person you should not miss to meet. "
6990,552469,20/9/11,22967,Marlo,Cynthia is an amazing lady.  Very generous and accommodating with her space.  I highly recommend her flat and would certainly stay with her again.  Super host!
6990,562207,24/9/11,928862,Daniel,This was my first shared AirBNB experience and it was interesting and enjoyable.  Cynthia is a delightful hostess who made my stay very comfortable.  The bedrooms are not ideal for tall people (like me) but her location is super close to the subway lines and her home is very artistic and clean!  I would stay there again just to hang out with Cynthia!  
6990,579035,28/9/11,1164994,Bruno,"Cynthia was a fantastic host. By the end of my stay it felt like we were close friends. Her apartment is amazing, literally overflowing with style and character. I highly recommend staying with Cynthia!"
6990,624889,13/10/11,332474,Gay,Our host provided a clean and well equipped apartment that was perfect for our stay.  All the little touches were well appreciated in this beautiful setting.  Our host provided support and was available if we had any problems.  It was a great stay.
6990,651378,22/10/11,302040,Margaret,"Cynthia was a wonderful, warm host, she showed us around her area and suggested several restaurants which were excellent.  We enjoyed the location and walked to Central Park several times, used the subway and the buses all nearby.  Thank you, Cynthia."
6990,676474,30/10/11,1305699,Marjella,Cynthia is great! Can't wait to be back on 10 December!

The apartment is beautiful, original, peacefully decorative and so agreeable.You have to be careful not to sleep too much there for your sight-seeng in NYC!! The location is Upper east side, near the Subway! very safe area and you can easily walk to the Central Park and the MET! The host owner is very nice, kind and friendly lady! If you love the art, it would be great to meet her!! Why?You can see there..    Perfect for a stay in NYC and moreover,for making a great memory. I'm sure to go back!! Thank you☆"
6990,760169,3/12/11,692813,Carol,"Cynthia’s endearing comments about Judy and I as her houseguests make my eyes misty.   Staying with Cynthia gave our fabulous trip an added dimension for enjoyment.  Cynthia’s persona is very spiritual to me.  She has a unique quality that captivates you….and she is also funny.

Cynthia’s home had never-ending artistic discovery on a daily basis for us, such as the totally unique water basin, the odd choice of a lamp shade in the kitchen, the mosaic mirrored kitchen back-splash as well as the shower surround, etc.  Cynthia’s highly acclaimed photographic artistry translates to her home décor.

Cynthia’s warmth and kindness were so appreciated as she escorted us around the neighborhood with dining recommendations, subway lessons—which we flunked on our first adventure differentiating UPTOWN vs. DOWNTOWN, but her subsequent tutorial straightened us out.

Cynthia and my traveling companion are twin “neat freaks” as far as cleanliness whereas I required forgiveness from time to time; to wit, the ultimate infraction of  wearing my boots in the house.  However, after Cynthia recovered from the shock to her cleanliness gene, she quickly forgave me with the admonition, “NO SHOES IN THE HOUSE.”

Cynthia’s blended energy drink in the morning enabled me as a 79-year-old broad to keep up with my young sidekick Judy.  Cynthia became our “House Mother,” waiting for our safe return at night with our daily report.

The most surprising revelation on this trip was how sweet and helpful the local New Yorkers  are to tourists.  There is a misconception that New Yorkers are rude, brusque and arrogant.  The opposite is true! In all my travels worldwide, I have never encountered nicer people who go out of their way to help you.

This is one of the beauties about airbnb, you get to meet people that you would not normally get a chance to meet. Carol came with her friend Judy. The 2 took to NYC and rode the tour game in joy and laughter, making the home-towner me see the city again. Carol is also the hero, where love wins the day. She married her high school sweetheart, while now in her late 70's, she wears the smile of a happy ever ending story. I can only hope that more people will get the chance to meet this fabulous woman. Thank you Carol and Judy for staying here, I had fun.

6990,800863,23/12/11,229907,Ian,"From the moment I saw the photos of Cynthia's apartment in New York I wanted to stay there. She is a fabulous hostess, so helpful and considerate. Nothing was too much trouble for her and I appreciated being invited to some of the activities that she was doing. That was a great way for me to learn more about New York (particularly as I was travelling on my own).
I've often thought about the option of taking an apartment by myself (as I did in Paris last year) but my experiences with Cynthia strongly tip the balance in sharing with an owner, it is so much more sociable and  enjoyable. 
Thanks for your hospitality Cynthia!!!"
6990,832334,3/1/12,1471457,Mayra-Alejandra,"Cynthia was great! Made me feel at home! She prepared lovely smoothies and fruit drinks every morning to start the day.

I stayed there for 8 nights. Privacy was never an issue until the second room got booked. Made the last couple of nights uncomfortable. 

Overall, excellent place to stay. Cynthia will invite you to meet her friends and welcomes you with such great energy. She's hilarious! Awesome sense of humor. She's extremely easy going and fun to talk to. Her art work is amazing and she'll tell you all about it.

If you ever get sick, or need to stay the day in, she has a variety of films on her Netflex. She's honestly a genuine and lovely person to be around with. I will definitely book her home again."
6990,885344,27/1/12,1318691,Xavier,"I came from France Aix en Provence to stay 8 days in NYC. My trip was a success with Cynthia who gives so much advises when we need. Always she is very helpful and facilitate to come from the JFK Airport or other places you want to visit. Cynthia's apartment in the Upper East and close from subway stations and buses. The home is very clean and quiet, my room was comfortable. After the day in NYC, it is relaxant to come back easily with subway or bus to the home. Cynthia knows to be considerate . I will recommend this place for friends who wants discover NYC and living in one friendly apartment and need help when it is necessary. xavier"
6990,974523,6/3/12,1723761,David,A fantastic and generous host. Very much looking forward to staying with Cynthia again soon. 
6990,1073686,2/4/12,1814362,Ben,"Cynthia is a great person to stay with; expect smoothies, art and noodles. Her apartment is appropriately luxurious and you're well situated on the 4-5-6 Metro lines which give you connections to the rest of the city, not to mention being a stone's throw from the bigger galleries and museums of Manhattan. A fantastic few days. Strongly recommended."
6990,1147609,18/4/12,1799380,Monika,"
To meet Cynthia and to stay in her tasteful outfitted appartement was a great pleasure for me. Cynthia is a very sympatic and warm person and she has an amazing positive attitude towards life. She is a wonderful and provident host, helpful in every situation. I had a phantastic and secure time in New York and after tiring tours in 'downtown' I felt like coming home. Her smoothies in the morning are the cherry on top."
6990,1178573,25/4/12,1252123,Rodrigo,"Amazing place and location, i would recommend this place to anyone who is traveling to NYC! the place to stay!  Cynthia was so helpful and she is the most amazing person that you will meet in your travels! THANK YOU CYNTHIA FOR EVERYTHING :)"
6990,1265747,12/5/12,1860524,Lucy,"stay was wonderful, the place makes you feel home and cosy. cynthia made her famous smoothies every morning. she is a great host. i would recommend her place to everyone. not only because cynthia is so taking care of her guests and beeing helpful in any kind of matters, she just got something, that not everyone has it. "
6990,1355440,27/5/12,1881125,Steven,"This is, indeed, one of New York's most-unique destinations.


Cynthia is an internationally-known visual artist with formal architectural training, and her home is the product of 22 years of sustained artistic focus. The photos are accurate but cannot capture a myriad small details such as the elegant solutions for concealing piping and wiring runs, or for ensuring adequate airflow between the lofts and open areas. At one point, I got a glimpse of a concealed wiring closet as she relocated her wifi base station -- I was impressed by the carefully-designed infrastructure that lies beneath the sumptuous exterior. 


As an extra treat, Cynthia's artwork graces the walls. The overall effect is stunning, like living in a bohemian fin-de-siècle palace -- admittedly a compact one, but a palace, nonetheless.


Cynthia herself is the epitome of the perfect hostess.  Her warmth and generosity is beyond compare. Her morning smoothies are the perfect metaphor -- healthy, fresh, and sustaining.  


Living successfully in a small shared place requires the willingness to balance intimacy with privacy, and she handles that balancing act with effortless grace. In the last week of my two-week stay, I fell ill. Cynthia went overboard to ensure that I was comfortable, even to the point of getting chicken soup for me! 


There is a large community of people around Cynthia, some drawn initially by her miniature palace.  I feel lucky to have joined that community. "
6990,1418111,5/6/12,446979,Katrina,"I enjoyed staying with Cynthia so much!  She works very hard to  take excellent care of her guests. She offers shelter that not only gives the body rest and renewal,  but also feeds the mind.   If you are lucky enough to get a chance to stay with her, you will never forget this trans formative experience.  "
6990,2076744,23/8/12,3242940,Bonnie,A truly lovely experience! Cynthia's gorgeous home was an excellent base for me to really explore the Upper East Side and her suggestions for the very best places to dine and visit were perfect. Cynthia organised everything seamlessly and she was so helpful that it was very easy to move in and have an excellent week. Thank you Cynthia - I shall return! 
6990,2276830,14/9/12,2448685,Ludger,"I stayed 2 weeks in Cynthia's home, which really is a place of artwork. I spent all days outside and made my daily reports after that in the blue room. I often finished at midnight.  The days were fully planned. So I was happy to be in a place next to the subway. Cynthia gave me some advices, called a taxi for me, and I loved her smoothies in the morning. Thank you for that very much, Cynthia! 

But I would like to point out a few things which should be mentioned. The pictures do not show the true dimensions of the blue room. The blue room is only about 6  square meters bed included. There is only a bench to sit on with no backrest. Stairs lead you to your bed. The bed goes over the floor. The room is open to the ceiling. Underneath is place for your clothes as well as on the opposite side. Real space to live in is therefore very very narrow.  The room is not separated enough. Everybody in the flat can hear everything you say.  There is no privacy in that room. 
There was not a single table with a chair in normal size in the kitchen nor in the living room nor in the blue room. I found a few bar stools in the kitchen, one of them I could use  in my room to reach my laptop. If you prepare your meal in the kitchen you have to eat from the working place sitting on a bar stool or standing. The fridge is too small for more than 1 person if rooms are booked. There is no microwave. The flat is shoe free, but Cynthia did not say that she does not like sandals or slippers. She walks barefoot and wanted me to do so or in my socks. I do not like that.  The place is beautiful, but to pay 95 $ for a room of 6 square meters?  Cynthia is nice at one hand. But she gave me the feeling that she cared at first about every piece in her flat, then about her guest. I would wish to see more respect for the dignity of guests from different countries with different aspects of life. Do I recommend? For people who like such very small places, yes.
"
6990,2308091,17/9/12,3231245,Dita,"Cynthia  makes you feel at home immediately , and her home is  a fabulous and special  place to stay when visiting NYC . Her home is  wonderful with thought given to every detail from the mosaic on the kitchen wall, the Aladdin treasure cave rooms ,the gorgeous bathroom and the stunning living room. But even more lovely is Cynthia herself , who takes care of her guests from the morning smoothies to the evening welcome when you return after a day in the city. I feel really  lucky that I stayed with her and will come back next year."
6990,2369563,22/9/12,3088678,Hui Sin,"One amazingly inspiring woman.
A warm and wonderful place with a soul of its own.
An unforgettable experience..."
6990,2518037,6/10/12,343939,Lynne,"One of the best things about my trip to New York was meeting Cynthia.  Waking up to her blending her famous 'happy juice' or arriving home to hear about her latest home project after a long day exploring New York was refreshing.  Simply, we clicked like sisters...and were never at a loss to find things to talk about.  As numerous other guests have said, her place is an inspiration to anyone artistic.  It's a continual work in progress with creative ideas flowing.  The two weeks I spent with her flew by.  As it was, we ran out of time for Raman noodles!  If you're looking for a place to stay where you immediately feel like you're with family or a close friend, this is the place.  She's spotlessly clean and graciously attends to any needs you may have.  If I have the opportunity to use Airbnb again, I can only hope I find a host as amazing as Cynthia.  Thank-you 'Mama' for a great introduction to New York.  Until I see you again...  :)

6990,2598381,13/10/12,1880860,Fernando,"Cynthia, oh Cynthia. How can I start about her and her lovely home?
Well it all really is perfect. She is a very thoughtful hostess: she makes ‘happy juice’ every day, she is talkative, inviting, patient, interesting and warm.
Her home is just gorgeous, being an Interior Designer myself, I totally fell in love with the whole European flair and uniqueness of this lovely and well located apartment in a safe and nice area in the Upper East.
You just can’t ask for more. An experience I am so thankful for having!
"
6990,2642649,17/10/12,1660681,Susan,"As everyone has said, Cynthia's place is beautiful and she is great fun. I regret that I was out and about so much that I didn't have much time to chat.  But that said, the place is perfect for social folks who want to get out and around. It's convenient to the subway, there are restaurants in the area, and the apartment is clean. Cynthia is a wonderful host. It's not the place for someone who wants to spend a great deal of time in their room alone. The room is small (but has plenty of room for all your stuff and a comfortable bed), and even with all the lights on, it's quite dark. But who goes to New York to stay in their room! The living room is wonderful and bright and comfortable, so if you have work to do you can sit in there. I'd definitely stay here again."
6990,2874578,13/11/12,3354541,Narelle,"Staying at Cynthia's apartment was an amazing experience, as not only is it perfectly located, but it's a beautiful, restful space to reside in. Cynthia made amazing smoothies every morning, and was a perfect host to hang out with. Everything in her apartment was geared towards making my stay as comfortable as possible. I would definetely recommend her apartment and I would also stay there again. 
You do require some athleticism to climb into the bed space, but this didn't cause an issue for me. "
6990,2908450,18/11/12,1723605,Polo,"My stay at Cynthia was simply fantastic. The location could not be better. Only a block away from the subway station. Three blocks away from central park... How about a walk in the park? Yes, please!! Plenty of restaurants, coffee shops (Yes, including Starbucks for those of you who are not willing to support small but great businesses). Cleaners, delis, clothing stores, barber shops... You get my point!. 
The actual place is UNIQUE. I doubt that many places in NYC are as nice as this little apartment. The building, like many in NYC is old but very well kept. Cynthia's apartment is beautiful. Small but so well organized and decorated that every little corner has personality. Cynthia is an artist and she is constantly working on her apartment and expressing her art throughout the entire place. The room is small but I was amazed with how much she was able to accomplish in that little space. She certainly has been able to create the feeling of an entire bedroom in the two cozy niches she has put together. She is a smart and charismatic lady. Always concerned about one's comfort. I enjoyed every conversation I had with her as she did not hesitate to share her thoughts on any given subject. Her fruit smoothies are just great and energetic. The perfect start for every morning. 
I can go on and on about this place but let just put it simply. Go ahead and book. You will not be disappointed. It will add to your whole experience next time you are in NYC. "
6990,2997201,30/11/12,202657,Imogen,"Cynthia was the perfect host for me. She took me out and about, showed me around the area and filled me in on pretty much everything that I needed to know for my first time here in New York. Her home is absolutely stunning!"

Her apartment is a work of art clean and comfortable even her bins are vintage!!!
Love love that apartment ( I still cant decide which is my fav room  between the bathroom,the kitchen or the living room...)

6990,4663595,19/5/13,5895781,Francesca,"Cynthia was an incredible host. She was warm, and kind, inviting me to gallery openings, taking me for runs on Central Park, and helping me plan my subway rides each day. The house is gorgeous, quiet, and unique. I slept wonderfully in the Blue Room, and Cynthia sweetly accommodated my early to bed, early to rise schedule. I'll be reaching out to her any time I'm in NYC. . "
6990,4750163,23/5/13,6298428,Kayla,"My second time to NYC & first time solo; also my first time using Airbnb. I am very glad I stayed at Cynthia's. I would highly recommend staying here if you want to get away from the ""touristy"" part of the city & explore the neighbourhoods. She is right in the heart of the Upper East Side. It was a wonderful stay. Here is my review: long & hopefully detailed enough. Cynthia as a host was fantastic. She had booked a car service for me to & from the airport (cheaper than a cab), & greeted me with open arms when I arrived. She immediately struck up conversation; this girl can talk, & her conversations are intriguing & wonderful. She respected that I wasn't a morning person, & kept quiet in the mornings. She let me borrow her umbrella during the one day that it poured. She gave me a subway map & explained the lines to me. She provided me with a list of nearby cafe's, restaurants, & grocery stores. She also gave me the low down on what's up with the museum admissions... I suggest staying with her if you want to know about that as well. Overall, she was very kind & helpful & I appreciated it all. The apartment itself looks exactly like the photos & is so thoughtfully & artistically designed & detailed. It was also extremely clean! Staying here was an experience in itself. Keep in mind the ""no shoes in the apartment"" rule is a strict one; all shoes are kept outside. Cynthia walks around barefoot, & I was comfortable doing the same, but if you aren't, make sure to bring socks or slippers. I found the loft very comfortable after my days of wandering around. There is an air conditioner up there that you have control over, which was very nice. The room was small but cozy, & the only thing worth mentioning is that the walls of the room & loft do not go all the way up to the ceiling so you will hear everything in the apartment. Also, the door to the room is see-through, so you do not have 100% privacy. Changing in the little dressing room was a bit tough for me at 5'4"" tall; consider changing in the bathroom if you are taller. The rest of the apartment is perfect. The area is wonderful. A pharmacy & Starbucks & a subway station within a block walk; Central Park steps away with the Reservoir greeting you when you enter. Museum Mile is close as well. Getting down to Brooklyn Bridge took about 20 minutes on the express lines & another 5 down to Bowling Green & Battery Park. Not too difficult to get to Times Square either. Overall, fantastic location. Lots of cute shops & places to eat. Very non-touristy feeling. I will be contacting Cynthia again if I ever need a place to stay in NYC. 5 star rating from me; fantastic stay. Would highly recommend...."
6990,7102317,6/9/13,7189005,Dirk,"From the moment i walked into the apartment i knew this was a different kind of airbnb experience. The interior decoration is beautiful and each room looks great in its own unique way, with chandeliers, mosaics and chic modern art all around.

Cynthia is a generous and kind person who went out of her way to make my five days in New York as fun and easy as it could possibly be. There are lots of grocery stores, restaurants, and things to do in the area, and walking around was pretty safe at night. Central Park is a five minute walk, the subway is 90 seconds away, and there's also the metro museum of art about a 15 minute walk away. All really convenient, but if you'll be spending most of your time downtown then lower Manhattan is very easy to get to in about 20-25 minutes on the subway, and Times Square is about the same with one train transfer on the way.

Cynthia was extremely considerate and always thinking ahead - she really is a wonderful host in what many might see as an intimidating city. New York is a great city full of predominantly great people, and Cynthia really made it feel that way as soon as i got there - after the first night i was more than comfortable and really enjoyed myself, when maybe i would have been a bit tentative going out at night by myself, it was great. I absolutely loved my stay and will be trying to make sure that all my friends stay with Cynthia when visiting this great city in the future."

The room was exactly as pictured and promised.  This apartment is a dream, very well-loved and cared for, and the location is fantastic.

The shower is great, I felt at home in the kitchen making tea and helping myself to cereal, the bed was very comfortable and linens exquisite and it's quiet quiet quiet at night. Location is great too -- an easy subway ride downtown, walkable to Guggenheim and Met, good restaurants in the hood, I felt fine walking home late at night too. I recommend it and would stay again."
6990,8222245,21/10/13,8991891,Wouter,"I had an amazing time  at Cynthia's place in Manhattan. 

Cynthia is an honest person and full of energy, willing to have interesting conversations about any subject you or she pops up. She helped me getting to her place from the AirPort and responds to email on à Really short notice.

When I arrived she showed me around in the neighbourhood, gave me a metrocard and explained me how to get on the train. The place is very close to all of the major things to see in NY.

Her place is totally clean and is flourishing with her own art., if thats your thing you would be amazed. Otherwise, it's stil very Nice and interesting to see.

6990,12175934,25/4/14,11823756,Belinda,"Being a first time Airbnb user, I had a hard time trying to sort out where to stay in such a big city...however, this apartment was a true adventure and haven at the same time. A great find! 

Opulently decorated with art work by the owner/host, it is well presented, clean and comfortable. Even though the rooms are snug, it is more than enough for the single intrepid traveller. 

Breakfast is a healthy mix of granola, hemp and chia seeds, raw chocolate a dash of agave oil and a generous dollop of natural yoghurt. A great starter for the busy day of sightseeing or shopping aead. 

Close to the subway direct to downtown and a short stroll to Central Park, it also has many facilities in the area including a 24hour convenience store/pharmacy, some great eateries and drinking holes. 

Best of all, the host, Cynthia, is a warm and most approachable person. She is helpful, has great tips for exploring the city and loves a chat. 

I would recommend this apartment to any one who wants to explore and experience New York like a local.

The location is very good and the neighbourhood is safe.

Cynthia replies promptly with booking requests and general queries about her place and when I arrived she showed me round her immediate neighbourhood and helped me with purchasing my MetroCard. She takes her responsibility as a host seriously and that can only be a good thing for any future guests. 

This was my first  Airbnb booking."

6990,17873367,18/8/14,18346148,Bobin,Cynthia was very friendly and nice. The room I stayed was small and cozy.The apartment was beautiful and comfortable. I think the location was perfect and close to central park and subways. She made sure to make me comfortable and apartment was  clean and maintained really well. I could use the kitchen and had choices of breakfast which makes you feel like being at your home :). I look forward to staying her  again too.
6990,18404327,26/8/14,16524715,Tom,"Cynthia's apartment is beautifully unique, you need only take the detail of her images & description as a guide of a thoughtful host. The furnishings and decoration are such a pleasure, comfortable and full of creative energy. A perfect location for art lovers, little more than 10 blocks from the Guggenheim, and with the Whitney & MET just beyond, along with Central Park's Conservatory Water. All central sights are walking distance, and key subway lines are just 1 block away if you prefer. Such good conversation from a like creative mind, someone who made me feel considered, thoughtfully accommodated and made me feel safe as a lone traveller, even inviting me to dinner. No small detail was not thought of. An excellent apartment, great recommendations and someone who added even more flair to a wonderful trip. "
6990,18664261,30/8/14,8254684,Thijs,"This was my first airbnb and it was a great experience at Cynthia's. The atmosphere of the apartment and her charming personality added greatly to my NY experience. In short: prompt and great communication, a clean, relaxing and comfortable apartment with the facilities in perfect working condition. A helpful and friendly hostess who takes care of her airbnb in a professional way. Access to main subway line is just around the corner. I would definitely book it again if i am staying in NY."
6990,19074142,6/9/14,17193454,Barbara,"Cynthia was a great host who really helped me to feel comfortable at home and finding my way into the New York jungle. The room was tiny but had everything I needed. Most important, it was completely quiet - something to appreciate when staying in a big city! The apartment is just beautiful with all decorations and details, and it is close to Central Park, the subway and museums."
6990,19460458,13/9/14,7272578,Katrina,"Great location, one block from metro stop and 3 blocks from Central Park which. Was important for me as I needed to continue some training. Cynthia's created a unique and warm home and she has fantastic energy, I don't know how she does it. Great suggestions on local places to shop and available for advice at any time. Hope to visit again and would recommend to anyone. "
6990,19819507,19/9/14,17753783,Talia,"I had a wonderful NY experience with Cynthia K. For a start, she was very responsive, and communication was easy and efficient. Before I arrived she provided many suggestions and tips of how to get there and things I could do and see.
When I arrived her welcome was warm and made me feel at home immediately. Cynthia was a great host - she was there when I needed her but I had privacy otherwise. In addition, she helped with all those little things one may need - an umbrella on a rainy day, a laminated subway map, etc.

The house is a real gem - everywhere you look there is another thing to explore. And everything is spotless and well maintained.
It is under 1 minute walk to the nearest subway, very close to central park, and within an easy walk from some of the most famous museums.

I had a great time and certainly hope to stay there again. "
6990,20491822,30/9/14,17118126,Nicole,"Cynthia is a fantastic host. She made me feel welcome from the very first moment I entered her apartment. She cares for the well-being of her guests, is very helpful with practical information (transportation in NYC, good places to eat etc.) and she is always open for a chat. 
The room is small but clean and very quiet and you are free to use the living room and kitchen. The apartment itself is worth a visit! Every room is furnished and decorated with an artistic touch that is a feast for the eye. The atmosphere is nice and comfortable. 
Situated on a quiet street on the upper east side, the apartment is in walking distance from Central Park and very close to a subway station with a direct line to downtown Manhattan (approx. 15 min.). It is thus easy to get to and from the place and the area feels secure, also at night.
I can warmly recommend a stay at Cynthia's!"
6990,21201890,13/10/14,19558439,Kathryn,"Cynthia provides so much more than a bed to sleep in (which was extremely comfortable by the way). The apartment is also her studio so expect to see art in the making and witness her passion and excitement about her work. It is also her home, so there are a few rules (alas I managed to forget most of them at least once - *sorry* Cynthia). Highly recommended."
6990,21651810,21/10/14,17278462,Ruben,The location was great
6990,21899130,26/10/14,6791936,David,"A Home Away from Home. The property is incredibly well located on the Upper East Side. 40min from JFK. 10min from Hyde Park. 15min from the Guggenheim. Great pizzas & burger joint nearby. 

The flat is incredible. Totally art deco. The rooms are small but very well furnished. The bedding is soft & the shower warm. 

Most importantly, Cynthia was a terrific host, welcoming, caring & attentive. 

I will be back."
6990,22395470,5/11/14,19999626,Roy,"Cynthia was really friendly and helpful. The place was really cool. My bedroom was very small but wasn't claustrophobic at all! The rest of the house looked really awesome too. And it was all very clean and well taken care of. The area was very calm. It was very convenient that there was a subway station very nearby.
So all in all, it was a very good experience "
6990,22599405,10/11/14,22483293,Georgina,"Lovely apartment, impeccably kept. Close to Central Park. Safe neighborhood. Cynthia is a very warm, friendly and inclusive host - I had a much more enjoyable trip as a result of staying with her than I would have in a hotel."

6990,24706148,2/1/15,20848173,Marilyn,"I stayed with Cynthia for two weeks during Christmas and New Years and definitely my trip couldn't be better. She is a really nice and interesting person who is up to help you to have a great experience around NYC. We spent a nice time together, her place is LOVELY!!! The Oak Room is a nice space, with a comfortable bed, space to your things and be sure you gonna have a good rest there. Like the description, the apartment is really close from the line 6 of the Metro Station, something that makes easy go and come from wherever you want. The neighborhood is really safe (walked around late at night few times and totally safe)
I'm glad to had choose Cynthia's place for my trip and already decided if I go back, do it at her place. Recommendation: Spent time with her, you won't be disappointed. Thanks for everything Cynthia!!!"

6990,26835036,20/2/15,549169,Giuseppe,"Sono stato 5 notti in questo meraviglioso appartamento. Cynthia si è rivelata un'ottima host, sempre gentile e premurosa. Mi ha aiutato per ogni dubbio o richiesta sulla città La metro è vicinissima e comoda per raggiungere ogni parte di NY. Sicuramente la contatterò per un prossimo soggiorno.
Grazie Cynthia, alla prossima!!!"
6990,27722553,10/3/15,1885154,Sonja,"Thank you Cynthia so much for your hospitality, kindness and for caring so much.  I had an wonderful stay with you and enjoyed spending time out with you. Your apartment is absolutely beautiful, in a fantastic location and I felt like I was sharing a home with a very good friend/housemate... you made me feel so welcomed.

6990,28254587,21/3/15,25082050,Elaine,"My week-long stay was simply fantastic.  The apartment and facilities were exactly as described.  Really well located for easy access to the subway (96th) and a short ride from the centre of the city.  I also appreciated the relative peace which you don't get if you're staying in the centre in a hotel which meant I slept really, really well there.  My stay offered me the opportunity to feel like I genuinely lived in NYC; which is exactly what I was looking for.  Staying there was a luxurious, quirky &  thoroughly enjoyable experience.  Being so close to Central Park was a real bonus.  The plethora of high quality coffee shops, bars, restaurants and shops within 5 minutes walk was brilliant.  Cynthia was totally amazing; an absolute gem!  She was welcoming, super helpful, fun, creative interesting and intelligent; what a fabulous combo!  Just brilliant to be around.  Her beautiful homes reflects her and is handcrafted with love.  Without a doubt I will definitely be back to stay there again - I like to think of Cynthia's beautiful apartment as my Carrie Bradshaw getaway in the gorgeous NYC.  I loved every minute of it!  Don't hesitate - book it now!  What are you waiting for?!"

6990,30382621,21/4/15,27373403,Anaïs,"For my first time in New-York, I had a really great time. Cynthia is really kind and she helped me to have the best journey. I felt like at home in her beautiful apartment which is really quiet and peaceful. From her place, it's really easy to go Downtown and Central Park is really close. I hope I will stay there once again and spend time to talk with Cynthia about art and life."

The room is indeed very small, the bed is great though. The house is beautifully decorated. The area has some nice restaurants, and is walking distance from Central Park and the Museum Mile. 

All in all, I can warmly recommend this place."

6990,48178150,24/9/15,39337478,Yurika,"写真のイメージどおりの素晴らしいお部屋でした。
ベッドルーム、リビング、キッチン、バスルーム、すべての室内の内装が美しく、清潔に保たれていました。静かな住宅街にあるので、夜はぐっすり安眠できます。お部屋は写真で見た感じ、少し狭いのかと予想していましたが、全然問題ありませんでした。リビングが広々としているので、こちらでくつろぐこともできると思います。
一番心配していたのは治安でしたが、地下鉄の最寄駅から近く、24時間空いているスーパー(日本のコンビニのような感じ)もいくつかあり、夜中でも人通りはわりと多いので、安心して帰宅することが出来ました。生活に必要なものは大抵最寄駅周辺で入手できます。
私は、毎日朝早くから観光に出かけて、夜遅く帰っていたので、家でくつろいだり、ホストと会話を楽しむことができませんでしたが、わずかな交流の間でも、旅に役立つアドバイスをたくさんくれました。帰りの飛行機が早朝便で、朝6時前に起こしてしまったのにもかかわらず、タクシーの手配や荷物運びを手伝ってくれたり、最後まで面倒見がよく、とても優しかったです。
気持ちのよいおもてなしと美しいお部屋に癒されて、最高のニューヨーク一人旅が出来ました。"

Cynthiaさんの統一感のある部屋の環境づくりには、ただただ脱帽です。ぜひ一度泊まることをお勧めします。

6990,53910671,14/11/15,47689423,Ken,"Staying at Cynthia's was a special event.  First, her place is exquisitely decoarated with an eclectic touch that only an artist like her could provide.  Coming home each night to her warm abode was like returning to a familiar surrounding you knew all of your life.  But most importantly, was Cynthia herself.  She not only made me feel very much at home but offered such an engaging conversation I look very forward to staying with her over and over again. I definitely found a wonderful new friend to talk and laugh with on my often otherwise weary travels about.

Five stars!  Highly recommend!"
6990,54405679,19/11/15,10884816,Elve,Good location，amazing decoration，warm care！All about Sweetie Cynthiais is a pretty good host. 5 days stay with a artist is a good experience.The room which I stayed is clean and warm，every morning she made apple&banana smoothie for me and we sit together and talk about our life.If u come to NYC，you cannot miss her place which felt like stay at home.

The apartment is located on the UES and around the corner of the apartment there is a subway station. I would definitley stay here again the next time I'm in NYC.
6990,55714947,5/12/15,43391888,Hector,"Cynthia's home was beautiful and made the trip to NYC quite special. The apartment is clean and creatively designed (and redesigned). It's in a great location, being one block away from the subway, and only a casual stroll away from Central Park.

Cynthia is an inspiring person and full of energy. She taught me a lot during our Life Conversations. She made me delicious smoothies every morning and gave genuine hospitality. More than anything, I'm grateful that I've made a new friend. "

6990,63335964,22/2/16,4292653,Ze,"It was my first Airbnb experience, and I'm glad I chose Cynthia's! She kept her apartment very clean and well-organized, and made sure I was comfortable with everything. I'm definitely going to miss chatting and cooking with her -- and having her delicious smoothies as breakfast!

I was having an exhibition in New York, and Cynthia helped me spread the news around and she even brought friends to attend the opening. Cynthia was not only a great host but also a great friend!"
6990,65062177,10/3/16,6152900,Zelma,"My stay at Cynthia's was exactly what I imagined in terms of location and space. I was more than elated by my hostess'  kind guidance, neatness and profound concern with making every second count! Cynthia pays great attention to details where and when they matter."
6990,65845342,17/3/16,60370404,Andrea,"This is one of the most beautiful, unique apartments I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. Cynthia is an artist who has spent decades making her space into a haven of mosaic walls, rustic doors, and antique chandeliers. It's a lovely surprise tucked into an otherwise straightforward, unadorned building. 

The room itself is small, but high ceilings and well-placed mirrors make it seem more spaciousness. As a place to sleep, the room reminded me of an old-fashioned sleeper berth on a very fancy train; it was dark, calm, and quiet. 

Cynthia is a wonderful and generous host who makes tea, breakfast smoothies, and even fresh, warm soy milk; she also knows the best places in the neighborhood to get ramen, pizza, and cheese—all very important. Staying with her was a very special unique experience, and I can see why her room is so consistently booked! Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others.

Cynthia was a more-than-gracious host "
6990,66203770,20/3/16,29324865,Juha,"Cynthia is a lovely host and her place is a real pearl of the Upper East Side. Apt is under 1min walk from subway station that connects you to downtown. I had really good tips for my trip from her. Not to mention morning smooties, tea and nice conversations.

Thanks C and my highest recommendations to all who are looking for a place to stay in NYC.

--juha"
6990,66996173,26/3/16,4471822,Mk,"This host made me feel like I really need to work on my host game. Cynthia is amazing, kind and thoughful. She booked a car for me, she checked in on me on the day and offered an invitation to get ramen. She was sweet and welcoming on everyday that I was there. 

Ok. Her home: Is a well curated museum. It beautiful, the art is surprising in it's beauty. The dragon fly thorax alone is worth the stay here, even if nothing were true. 

This place is a treasue. "
6990,69748922,13/4/16,22531496,Deb,Cynthia was a terrific host! The room and beautiful apartment were exactly as advertised. Proximity to trains was a 2 min walk. I had a terrific time and would definitely stay again - thanks Cynthia!

Her house is kind of museum. Neat cozy very clean and comfortable... "
6990,71468375,25/4/16,57569233,Teresa,"Do you have to give extra ""stars"" when your host quite literally saves your life?  What the heck, she gets them.   Going above and beyond what one expects of a host, Cynthia helped me carry my (VERY heavy) duffle bag to the cab, and as a bonus, she yanked me out of the path of a bus I was distracted enough to almost walk in front of.

I very much enjoyed my stay at Cynthia's place--the pictures don't begin to do it justice.  Works of art and lovely, quirky little touches are everywhere.  She made her crust-less apple ""pie"" (which was delicious!) as a welcome, and kindly left a light on at night to make it easier to navigate to the bathroom.  One evening when I got home early we sat on the front stoop talking for an hour--she's a very interesting person.

The bedroom is TINY, and the bed is small but very comfortable--I slept great for the five nights I was there.  Everything was very clean and well-maintained.  

I highly recommend this lovely spot with its welcoming host--it is right down the street from the subway, as well as a Starbucks, a drugstore, and some very cool little restaurants.  "

Her place is like an art museum and unique and cozy. Location is close to subway no.6 so that means you can get to grand central station easily.

Great place to recover from jet lag since the room has thick curtains to make it completely dark without light from outside and comfortable bed mattress. "

She was incredibly hospitable in every sense of the word. This will come to be your home away from home. The apartment is the coolest.... artfully and tastefully decorated and well maintained. I loved it. The bedroom is small, but (Website hidden by Airbnb) cocoons you in comfort. You will get the best nights of sleep and rest, which is needed for your days of fun. It is perfectly located in the upper east end and 4 blocks from Central Park. The metro to downtown in right around the block. Your restaurant selection is vast. I cannot say enough good things about my stay here and how much I enjoyed myself!! Cynthia is the loveliest of hosts and a wealth of NYC knowledge!! "

The best thing about the  apartment is Cynthia though, what a great host!!! I felt right at home from the first moment and had many interesting and inspiring conversations with her. It was like staying with a friend! Also, the apartment is stunning, a total piece of art, meticulously decorated in the most unique way. I highly  recommend staying with Cynthia. You will not be disappointed!!"

Great location with easy access to subway system, walking distance to several restaurants/museums, and Cynthia was a great host. Would definitely recommend staying here for your stay in the city. "
6990,122570467,24/12/16,102013395,Claudia,"Cynthia's is the perfect place to stay in New York. She made me feel so comfortable and at home, it was as if I'd known her my whole life. While I was stressed with work during my trip, Cynthia made my trip to New York so fun and memorable. Her apartment is very comfortable, with a great location near the subway. I can't wait to stay with her again next time I come to the city and I can't say enough great things!"

6990,137989775,18/3/17,116139362,Shirley,"The location is great. The two subways will take you almost everywhere downtown.
The area is relatively quiet and safe at night.
Cyn is so warmhearted and caring that you'll feel like visiting your relatives."
6990,140041947,27/3/17,117002508,Chen,"The room is really clean, and the location is great. It's convenient to go to the metropolitan museum and central park. The host is the best host I have ever met. She is really nice, kind, and friendly. "

6990,143355098,11/4/17,9605549,Miguel,"The wife asked me to post this as is:  Cyn's place is like an artist's haven. The room is small (it's NYC), but everything you'll need is there. It's also beautifully whimsical. The neighborhood is quiet, close to the subway and the 24 hour pharmacy. As for Cyn herself, she was warm and welcoming... always reachable by phone or email to answer any questions, and even before I checked in, she got in touch with my hubby to make sure we had a clear idea of how to get there. Would definitely recommend her place, and am looking forward to staying there again."
6990,145204301,17/4/17,35410682,Daniel,"Cyn fue un host maravilloso. De los mejores que he estado (sino el mejor) el lugar es limpio bien ubicado. La habitación no es muy grande pero está bien, contrasta con el corazón de Cyn y lo Buen anfitriona que ella es. Siempre ofreciendo cosas, ayudando, y preparando un smoothie todas las mañanas. Es muy atenta y considerada. La recomiendo 120%!!!!"
6990,146316905,22/4/17,26220514,Roger,"I'm so thankful for AirBnB because it's only by this service, a stroke of luck, and planets aligning that I was able to meet someone as interesting and unique as Cynthia and stay at her fittingly unique and interesting place. I think the major value of AirBnB is not just finding a place to stay, but being able to see life through a different lense, that of the host. 

That said, the place is something else and I don't think I'd do it justice by trying to describe it. Do yourself a favor and stay a few nights there. The location is great as the museums and the park are right there. The 6 train is right around the corner and it'll take all the way down to the lower parts of Manhattan fairly quickly"

You'll like every part of her place since it's beautiful, unique and clean! And the room is perfect for recovering from your jet lag. And she can make the best smoothie for you(a real good one)! Cynthia is not just a host but a real friend for sure! Can't wait to meet her again ! "

On arrival, Cyn took me for a walk around Central Park (only 5 minutes away) and was full of great local advice. I highly recommend staying with Cyn."

The location can not be more perfect (just a 5 min walk from Central Park and 2 min from the 4, 5, 6 and Q subway lines). Everything is very comfortable and Cyn is in every detail. I loved living a week at her home ... and I will surely come back... hopefully soon ;)"

6990,164294411,26/6/17,131958203,Donna,"Cyn's apartment was so comfortable, and she was so welcoming. I had the use of the whole space even though she was also there. She was helpful, but not intrusive, recommending restaurants in the area, and there were many small, inexpensive, but excellent places, and also travel tips to different parts of the city. I found the neighborhood very convenient to all the places I needed to go and felt quite safe no matter what time of day I was out and about. Having Central Park right at my fingertips was also a plus for an early evening stroll. I highly recommend this AirBnB for your next trip to NYC."
6990,167110368,5/7/17,23644401,Sahalya,The apartment was beautiful and clean. Cyn was extremely considerate and welcoming. The breakfast smoothie was a nice surprise. Conviently located next to the 6 train and department stores.  I would definitely stay there again.

Et l'hôte, Cynthia est ADORABLE : très réactive aux messages, attentive aux détails et à l'écoute de son hôte, de superbes discussions, bonne conseillère sur les bonnes adresses et endroits à visiter, un smoothie wouaouh tous les matins. Avoir une hôte comme Cynthia rend le séjour encore plus parfait!"

Gastgeberin ungeheuer nett und hilfsbereit. Wer allerdings viel sitzen möchte, hat schlechte Karten, da es keine Stühle gibt."
6990,191756383,8/9/17,101832883,Satomi,"I stayed at Cyn's place for 5 days, but thanks to her great hospitality, I felt as if I've already lived many years there. Everything in her place is aesthetic until the tiniest details, I felt like living in the museum. The location is perfect, too, it is very well connected with public transportations, you can go everywhere easily. She also gave me a great introduction to the NY city. Cyn is an energetic, super cool and open-hearted person - one of the most amazing persons I've ever met! Sincere thanks again for all lovely time during my NY stay, and hope to see you soon again!"

6990,202039918,9/10/17,12308758,Elizabeth,"So much to love about this place! It's arty and interesting and comfortable and clean. It's also in a great neighbourhood. Right away from all the touristy hoo-har of mid-town and downtown, but easily accessible on two subway lines - the 6 and the Q. If you're staying for over a week like I did, Cyn will provide you with a metro card. All you have to do is load it up for $32 and you go anywhere and everywhere you want. But the best thing about this place is Cyn herself. I started most of my mornings with a healthy smoothie and oodles of interesting chit-chat. NYC is an awesome place anyway, but staying here made it even more awesome!"
6990,211629833,13/11/17,64841795,Rosalind,I had a wonderful stay!

6990,215955693,2/12/17,333422,Carol,"Cyn Is a photographer and artist.   Her home has been an ongoing art project for about 20 years.  It is beautiful, comfortable, and every detail has been thought through. Committed to her guests’ comfort, she happily oriented me to the neighborhood and gave me ideas for what to see in Manhattan.  I had a great time —and a much better time than had I stayed In a hotel. Thank you so much, Cyn!"

Flat itself is spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with real care evident throughout. Cyn was a perfect host - incredibly generous and willing to share local's tips for New York. Great location, too - just a minute's walk from the subway, so east to get anywhere. Plus lots of the main museums and galleries are within walking distance from the flat anyway! Would highly recommend."

6990,225181986,5/1/18,130915635,Juliana,"O apartamento é muito estiloso e bem localizado, a 1 quadra e meia do metrô, 1 quadra de Starbucks, farmácia... então facilmente você pode ir onde quiser. Na chegada há escadas, mas ela te ajuda com a mala. Fui no extremo inverno e o chuveiro é bem quentinho. A cama, o edredom e o travesseiro são maravilhosamente confortáveis, e o quarto é 100% silencioso então você pode dormir até a hora que quiser. O  quarto é bem pequeno, então se você tiver com muitas malas pode ser complicado. Cyn é uma excelente pessoa e te deixa muito a vontade, como se fosse sua própria casa. Ela deixa você tomar 2 banhos no dia (e até gosta que você tome), é muito limpa e organizada. Te trata calorosamente e amigavel, e mesmo se você não dominar o inglês, ela tem toda a paciência do mundo e te ensina quantas vezes for necessario como funciona as coisas da casa te mostrando na prática, não com bilhetinhos, o que torna mais agradável. E sempre dará um jeito de ajudar você quando você estiver em apuros. Ela me ajudou muito, não sei o que seria de mim sem ela. Pediu até para uma amiga dela intermediar a conversa em português comigo e me deu muitas dicas e atenção quando teve uma tempestade de neve. Eu só tenho a agradecer. Eu realmente recomendo que você se hospede em lugar onde você possa se sentir seguro."
6990,249740649,2/4/18,8067055,Ines,"Cyn is the most amazing host, super welcoming, friendly, warm, attentive, communicative and caring. Her house is a spectacular artistic project, spotlessly clean, super comfortable, perfectly located. I truly enjoyed staying with Cyn and believe this is the absolutely perfect place to stay in NYC. Highly recommend!"
6990,252891951,12/4/18,87113648,Luis,"Cyn es una gran anfitriona. Pasé ocho noches en su apartamento y aun habiendo otras dos personas hospedadas, siempre tuve privacidad. La habitación es muy silenciosa. Cyn está atenta a lo que necesites y a responder a las preguntas. La ubicación es ideal porque hay dos estaciones de metro, una a 70 metros y otra a 300 metros, desde donde se puede acceder en 15 minutos al centro de Manhattan. Por Lexington hay muchos lugares para tomar café, almorzar, cenar y se percibe tranquilidad y seguridad a toda hora."
6990,258192948,28/4/18,156343609,Aidan,"Great apartment to stay in, nice size room with enough space for all clothes and essentials. Location is excellent for public transport, local food and shopping. Will definitely be staying here again if I go back to New York"
7036,254793,7/5/11,387311,Donald,Very clean and tiny house with fantastic location (only two blocks from Church Ave (F/G)! Akiko tried her best to help me organise my logistic issues with a prompt communication. Great experience in NY and I do appreciate her hospitality.
7036,271510,19/5/11,577952,Chow,The host canceled my reservation 3 days before arrival.
7036,338171,27/6/11,501947,Harold,This listing is part of a relatively new condo ... immaculately clean with all the conveniences e.g. washer/dryer and cable TV. There is also a nice roof area to enjoy warm weather days. The Brooklyn neighborhood is very quiet and there is a subway station a couple blocks away. If you're looking for an economical selection with all the trappings this is your spot. The host is also very attentive and helpful.
7036,551761,20/9/11,830667,Sheree,"The place is very nice. It's new, clean and very accessible to subway. Area is very safe, lots of food choices around. Akiko is very helpful and accommodating. Highly recommended."
7064,80175,17/8/10,164163,Bradley,What a great spot. The apartment is spacious and relaxing. The neighborhood has tons of great food and is great for getting to Manhattan or other neighborhoods in Brooklyn. To top it all off Joelle is very communicative and went out of her way to accommodate my travel plans. I would certainly go back the next time I'm in NY.
7064,127718,26/10/10,198013,Svetlana,"Unfortunately, I didn't get to meet Joelle, but her place is super cool and with lots of character. It is located centrally in the Williamsburg area. There are a lot of interesting shops, cafes and bars just a step away from the apartment. I had a chance to meet and chat a bit with Joelle's roommate below as well as one of the neighbours and they were both extremely friendly and helpful. I had a great time here and would love to return again when in Brooklyn/NY. "
7064,431965,9/8/11,257793,Mireia,un lugar ideal para relajarse y vivir el ambiente de Williamsburg en un espacio muy acojedor y con buenisima energia. Excelente anfitriona.

7064,2843438,9/11/12,3384682,Mathilde,We had a very great time at Joelle's place ! the neighborood is a very charming one and the room we lived in was very spaceful and nice.
7064,6785606,25/8/13,7174886,Cindy,"My daughter and I stayed at Joelle's place for about a month and it was an overall wonderful experience. To start with Joelle was great throughout about providing consistently clear and concise communication,  just enough to be helpful but not at all intrusive.  
She was there to meet us even as our arrival time was somewhat ""iffy"" and late night.  She provided us with several pamphlets about local attractions, events, etc., suggested several late night eateries, and drew maps to subway stations close by. 
Though Joelle was out of town for the remainder of our trip, she left us well supported with information, contact info. for herself and neighbors, and checked in with us a couple of times throughout our stay. 
Joelle's roommate, Annie, who was there for part of our stay, was a wonderful balance of friendly, helpful, yet respectful of using the common areas and of our privacy. 
The apartment is just as fantastic as it looks in the photos. The bedroom area is a large open area containing within it a cozy living area and a long desk/work area backed with wall-to-wall book shelves. The kitchen and bathroom(on the same floor) were a nice size for our needs.  Both spaces have ample skylights which of course provided great natural lighting and completed that amazing airy loft feel. Joelle had thoughtfully cleared storage space in the closet, kitchen, and bathroom areas, so we had more than enough space for our belongings.  We ended up eating quite a few meals at home and the kitchen efficiently met our needs. The space in general provided a very comfortable and peaceful refuge at the end of our busy days.
The apartment is located in a great neighborhood, very convenient to a wide variety of restaurants, shops, etc.while not being in the midst of too much noise and commotion.  There are two subway stations within comfortable walking distance, a bus stop close by,  and there's even a movie theater at the end of the block. (My daughter, a cinephile, was in heaven!) In terms of security, the neighborhood felt very safe and the apartment itself has two locked doors to gain entrance, so security was never an issue.
In a one-sentence wrap-up, we loved the whole experience and would do it again in a heartbeat! Thanks Joelle and Annie!

"
7064,18306856,25/8/14,797731,Noam,"You'll find Joelle's Boho-chic apartment deep in the heart of boisterous Williamsburg. If you wanna get to know the area there's no better place from which to do it. Joelle is responsive, kind, open and full of only good intentions. With the L train a short walk away you're minutes from Manhattan. I recommend the waterfront and the Polish bakery on North 8th."

The place is beautiful and spacious. I would gladly stay here in the future (though thankfully my housing situation is resolved!)"
7097,24107,16/1/10,36847,Rich,"A great space for a fair price in one of Brooklyns best neighborhoods. Bed was comfortable and had access to a washer dryer which was extremely helpful as well as nicely appointed sitting room   There were many wonderful eateries within a 4 or 5 block area
I highly recommend this one"
7097,38324,26/4/10,102024,Lianne,"Gorgeous brownstone renovation in a nice neighborhood.  It definitely WAS ""perfect for parents"".  We had the top floor with big, comfy bed.  Attention to detail, immaculately clean, welcoming host.  Highly recommend this."
7097,39850,3/5/10,110176,Edan,"Highly recommend.  My parents recently stayed with J., they loved her house.  J was friendly and hospitable, offering a tour of her entire home which blew them away - J. has put tremendous love and effort into restoring her brownstone.  

The garden unit was clean, large, and beautifully furnished.  And the attached garden was extremely attractive.  

The bed is a foldout but reportedly quite comfortable (and my father is a big guy, he presents a real test for a bed!).  The ""kitchen"" has a sink, coffee maker, fridge, but no stove/oven.  

I give J.'s place four stars only because the last guest had not adequately cleaned the dishes and there was no sponge with which to do the job, we had to go out and buy one.  Minor quibble.  Apart from that, it was a five star experience for a fair price.  "
7097,44638,21/5/10,115645,Caroline,"We felt so lucky to have found this garden apartment and were well taken care of by J! Fort Greene is an amazing area close to the city but quiet, lush (at least in May) and full of great places to eat. The apartment is on one of the nicest streets in the area, close to everything but still peaceful. It was very clean, beautifully renovated, the bed was comfy and the kitchen perfect for our needs - which was breakfast, because honestly, if you are in NYC to visit you should eat out as much as possible. The garden is lovely and was perfect for breakfast or for drinks in the evening. Highly recomended!"
7097,52544,13/6/10,115085,Louis,"J made us feel at home instantly.  The townhouse is airy, bright, and VERY clean. The top floor was a comfortable and roomy getaway.  We hope to return."

I would certainly stay here again.  The neighborhood is safe and full of great places to eat and useful stores, and a nice park. I wish I lived there. 5 stars without hesitation."
7097,94255,10/9/10,204079,John,"My wife and I stayed in the garden apartment for three days and we could not have been more pleased.  J made it very easy to get in and get ourselves comfortable.  The WiFi worked great, the bed was comfortable, and the shower is fantastic.  This is a spacious place with your own entrance, the rooms are clean, and the sleeping is at the back where the overhead fan makes it even more likely that you will sleep peacefully.  We needed to set the alarm to get up in the morning — it's that quiet.  We would be glad to stay here again, in fact, we will make this our first choice the next time we're in Brooklyn."
7097,95497,12/9/10,126900,Judy,"Even though I would not recognize her from her photo, the person we met was lovely, as was her apartment, conveniently located in a beautiful part of Brooklyn, and so quiet that we overslept! We hope to stay there again on future trips."
7097,97348,14/9/10,209761,Pat,"Beautiful, quality rooms and garden, in a lovely neighborhood; so much nicer than a top notch hotel room. Convenient to subway. Owner is practical and helpful but not intrusive.   A great way to experience Brooklyn brownstone living at it's best. We will be back."
7097,100582,19/9/10,229480,Dennis,"We rented the top-floor space and found it beautiful, spacious, and very clean- and just around the corner from many excellent bars, restaurants and cafes. Conveniently located to several subway stops.

We'll definitely be back."

We really enjoyed the large garden in the back--quiet and peaceful.  The host J. was great, very friendly and accomodating, giving us helpful info on everything.  We would most definitely stay here again.  "
7097,104150,24/9/10,134758,Eihway,"The top floor is gorgeous and very clean. The photos don't adequately show the charm and spaciousness of the place. There is a beautiful stained glass skylight in the landing area and a small room that is connected to the bedroom by French doors that has the closet and dresser as well as an additional window. The ""laundry room"" is also on the top floor and looks more like a dining room with a big table and chairs and was only used by me. 

The place was very quiet with a view through the trees outside of the other brownstones on the block. The neighborhood is very attractive with restaurants and stores.

J was very responsible. 

"
7097,110795,3/10/10,247238,Kate,"My stay at J's place could not have been better (stayed on the third floor).  It's gorgeous and much bigger than the pictures make it seem.  There's a kitchen-like room with a table and chairs (though just a sink, no fridge or stove/microwave), a beautiful bathroom, a bedroom and a dressing room off to the side.  Plenty of natural light through windows and skylights and very tastefully decorated.  It was an absolute pleasure to be there.  Feels very private even though people are living downstairs.  We neither heard nor saw anyone until we were literally walking out the door to leave.  However, J made it known that we could reach if we needed anything.  Would return in a heartbeat.

J was great - very friendly, helpful, and thougtful. We appreciated everything from the coffe beans and coffee grinder to the wine glasses.  We hope J's place is available if we go to NYC again!"
7097,133387,4/11/10,255286,Jim,"J's place worked out perfectly for our stay.  We walked to wine shops, restaurants, my daughter's apartment... It was a perfect location for us.  The apartment was quite nice.  J even had a coffee grinder and whole bean coffee in the room for us.  On our 1st stay in Brooklyn we stayed at the Nu Hotel.  It was nice, however, the price, room, comfort and location of J's place was a MUCH better option!  Thanks J!"
7097,149571,6/12/10,288974,Beth And Anish,Excellent stay. Beautiful building with five-star furnishings. Great interactions with the host. Fun neighborhood. We're true believers!

7097,278222,24/5/11,126968,Rory,"This was a great find - and really perfect for parents. Plenty of space and well looked after, the garden is beautiful for relaxing days reading the papers. It's right around the corner from Fort Greene and the C, G and N, Q trains.  Perfect."
7097,334708,26/6/11,460217,Jennifer,"What an amazing place to stay (we were in the garden apartment)... the rooms are of a generous size and the quality of the furnishings and design work is of an extremely high standard.  The garden is such a treat to have, especially in a big city like NYC.  The kitchenette was perfect for making tea and had plenty of useful dishes, glasses, utensils, et cetera.  The bed was large and comfortable, the television is huge, the shower is powerful and gorgeous and J was so helpful and responsive to any questions - we had total privacy while we were staying in the apartment, but she left us her number so we could ring her if we needed anything.  It is such a wonderful place to stay, so much nicer than a hotel - we would definitely go back and will recommend to all our friends.  "
7097,452437,16/8/11,962212,Natalie,"Nice/safe location. We had the whole top floor and it was lovely. Very clean and nicely decorated. Had a kitchen area, own bathroom with a deep tub, and a separate room area for the closet. It felt very roomy and made you forget you were in the busy crowed area of Brooklyn. "
7097,467986,22/8/11,980995,Susan,"Stunning home in great location.  Perfect for ""parents"".  We stayed on the third floor; beautiful furnishings and very private.  Host was entirely accommodating with facilities."
7097,482352,28/8/11,985893,Stacey,"I booked the garden apartment for my parents and it was indeed perfect. They loved the place and thought it was wonderful to have a ""home"" to stay in while visiting their new grandson in Brooklyn. They found the bed very comfy and the apartment was charming. We will definitely look to use this location again for future visits!"
7097,509524,6/9/11,1015343,Ignasi,"We were in the garden flat. Great and adorable place in a quiet neibourhood in Brooklyn. The subway is quite close. Safe. Jay is a good person. I recommend it 100%.

Thanks Jay for all!!"
7097,527572,13/9/11,814715,Susan,My visit to NYC was wonderful. I love Fort Greene! Jay's apt  is lovely and cozy. The apt is a couple of blocks from the subway and an easy ride to the city. I will stay again!

7097,1020817,19/3/12,1736762,Sheila,"This garden apartment was lovely, with interesting appointments throughout and careful attention to decor. I stayed 4 nights, and enjoyed being able to work in the apartment. The weather two of the days in March was nice enough to sit and work outside. J was very accommodating, prompt in responding to any questions or needs, and flexible on check in and out."
7097,1254157,9/5/12,2154544,Mary,"Pros: Good location within walking distance of many good restaurants along Dekalb. Seven blocks to G or C subway. The bathroom is large and well lighted. The apartment is large.

Cons: Bed is uncomfortable. Second mattress atop sleeper sofa is foam, it's mushy, soft, worn-out, has a tendency to roll you to the middle, not good with two adults. Sheets, bedding are showing signs of wear, pulled off around corners every night. Would give this place more stars if the bed was better and for the price per night it should be better. 
The back yard chairs and tables were very dirty and could not be used."
7097,1275945,14/5/12,902420,Kaden,"Very private fairly spacious flat. Lovely garden was a major plus over a beautiful weekend. Wonderful location, close to everything! 

The only reason I'm not giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because the bed is on a pull out frame, so it may not be comfy sleeping for everyone, but we slept fine and truly enjoyed 2 nights at the apt. 

We plan on being repeat visitors!"
7097,1317760,21/5/12,391806,Claudia,We had a delightful stay at Perfect for Parents visiting family in Clinton Hill. The apartment is spacious and the weather was great for enjoying the garden patio. Jay is an accommodating host as well. Great location with everything we needed within walking distance. Highly recommend!
7097,1421605,5/6/12,2383908,Mildred,Great quiet apartment with great light and a lovely backyard.  Beautiful new bathroom with a fabulous shower.   It really did feel like a home away from home.
7097,2538472,8/10/12,3353828,Charlotta,As advertised.  My mother and sister stayed there for my wedding  in early October and had a great time.  The garden is beautiful.  The kitchen area is lovely.  Everything was clean.  It is my favorite neighborhood in Brooklyn.  I'm sure my relatives will stay again.  Jay is very helpful.
7097,2607708,14/10/12,3583339,Dan,We had a very pleasant experience at Jay Al's place.  Jay Al was an excellent host and the apartment is as seen in the pictures.  No complaints whatsoever!!!
7097,2951503,24/11/12,1171951,Nancy,"I loved our stay at Jay's.  The setting and beauty of her place was unexpected. The photos don't do the home justice.  We were very happy.  There was plenty of room to spread out.  The little sunroom doubling as a place to snack and make coffee or tea was so cozy.
The neighborhood is beautiful, close to subways, little cafes and restaurants.  Fort Greene was made a historical landmark in the late 70s so history is present and thick. "

We had complete privacy in the basement apartment with our own private entrance. The apt is tastefully decorated and clean, the garden is beautiful to wake up to in the morning. The neighborhood is lovely, lots of brunch places within 1 to 2 blocks and an amazing coffee shop 1/2 block away. Fort green park is a short walk, we spent a few hours just roaming around the neighborhood.  
I highly recommend this apartment. We had an excellent time! "

7097,5144188,15/6/13,6094565,Claire,We had a fantastic stay in this beautiful garden apartment in a really cool part of Brooklyn. We couldn't fault the apartment or our host and would highly recommend it. A great first air bnb experience!
7097,5191736,17/6/13,2573256,Wayne,"We've been travelling to NYC/Brooklyn for over 13 years.  We've never had two nights as quiet and peaceful as the two we spent here.  The neighborhood is quiet, yet close to anything one could want in entertainment, food or necessities.  The garden is beautiful (but you do have to be careful as there is some poison iv y growing).  As long as our family lives in the area, we will try again to stay here."
7097,5736333,14/7/13,4326843,Alexandra,"This is a great space-- quiet and private and actually very lovely. We particularly enjoyed being able to go out and sit in the garden when the weather was good-- it's so unusual to have your own private green space in NYC! Also quite convenient to a number of trains, and such an adorable neighborhood. "
7097,5860358,20/7/13,5693097,Mariana,"It was a wonderful place for our holidays. Everything excellent, we felt at home. Exquisite details on decoration and attention. The appartment is private and located in a very nice neighbourhood, near the subway and some good restaurants.
We were received by a very nice and kind woman, who was always available for us, and offered us help, information and advice, very useful to enjoy the amazing New York city. Thank you!!!"
7097,6459687,13/8/13,1554514,Sandy,A very lovely apartment that suited our needs perfectly! Highly recommended.
7097,7284042,14/9/13,8187197,Rob,"Best place in Fort Greene neighborhood, and not just for the money, all around. The location is prime with all the great shops, cafés and restaurants within walking distance (I recommend Dekalb Ave. and Myrtle Ave.) This is one of the nicest and safest neighborhoods in I have stayed in in Brooklyn. Oh, and a cool Farmers Market in the Forte Green park every Sat. Jane was phenomenal. She made early morning accommodations to meet me upon check in and gave a bright eyed and bushy tailed tour of the place. Everything was super nice, loved the decor and it was very very clean...spotless! There is also a private outdoor patio that most people in Brooklyn would kill to have... "
7097,7674813,29/9/13,4692935,Polina,"We stayed at Jane's place at the end of September and really enjoyed this garden suite. The place was very clean, nicely decorated and spacious, with access to a pretty garden and patio outside. The house is located on a beautiful and quiet street and is close to many great restaurants and shops. Jane was accommodating and responsive to all our requests. The only thing to be mindful of is that the bed is actually a pull out couch. We found it rather comfortable nonetheless."
7097,8093822,15/10/13,5375087,Catherine,"We had a great stay at this apartment!  Everything went very smoothly--we felt bad having been delayed in transit, but Jane met us with the key and explained everything very graciously despite the late hour.  It was a nice set-up--a separate ground floor apartment with its own entrance, but the owner lived in the building, so we felt like it was easy to be in touch with her if we needed anything.  As it happened, the place was great and we didn't need any help.  

The apartment is nicely decorated and very homey.  We liked the huge bathroom and the views of the pretty garden.  We were nervous about the sofabed, but it turned out to be very comfortable, and we slept very well each night.  

Fort Greene is a gorgeous neighborhood full of classic brownstones, and though we'd lived in New York before, exploring this area was a whole new adventure.  The park is a short block from the apartment, and it is lovely.  We also walked to Brooklyn Flea and many great restaurants in the neighborhood.  There is quite a brunch scene around! (Our favorite place we tried may have been Cafe Paulette, with its classic French atmosphere--it is only a few weeks old!) We also walked to Park Slope a few times, another lively neighborhood which is not too far.  Just be aware that most metro lines are a 10-15 minute walk--it was totally fine for us, and we spent most of our time in Brooklyn, but just know that getting to Manhattan is not a matter of a few minutes, if that is important to you.

We had a great stay and would highly recommend this apartment!  It was comfortable and left us well-positioned to explore one of New York's most charming neighborhoods."
7097,8406247,29/10/13,8655173,Helen,"We had a wonderful time!  The space is private and lovely - the garden gives it an airy, even larger feel. J. was there to greet us, knows the neighborhood and was very accommodating.  We are looking forward to our next visit."
7097,8598428,7/11/13,2348964,Cathrin,My dad loved the place and will come back.
7097,8907441,25/11/13,9751803,David,"Airbnb

Fantastic place for enjoying Brooklyn … or even Manhattan since it’s close to transit.

We drove in from Virginia and found parking within a few spots of the door in mid-afternoon. (Left the car parked there the rest of the weekend, but noticed a regular turnover of parking spots.)

Space is tastefully done, quiet … and really spacious. This is not a hotel room or a suite – it’s a full apartment. I enjoyed having coffee in the rocker in the kitchen/sun room every morning. (There’s coffee to be made or you can dash down to the corner and buy two bagels and two coffees for less than $5. We bought.)

The only hitch was the bed, which J. clearly states is a sofa bed. I slept (and napped) like a rock. My wife, who is half my size, complained that she kept rolling into me. Lesson for all of you: Don’t sleep with me.

We sampled the neighborhood restaurants, all very good, and strolled through Fort Greene park people watching New Yorkers being surprisingly normal. 

Too cold for garden, but we enjoyed looking out at it. It must be spectacular in the spring.

Never used Airbnb before. We’ll be back. And we'll be back to Perfect for Parents, With Garden.

The apartment is lovely, comfortable, and well furnished. The garden is beautiful and we enjoyed coffee, cocktails, and long conversations there. This neighborhood has great coffee shops and restaurants, and is within walking distance of Fort Greene Park. We especially love the Brooklyn Flea, Cafe Paulette, and Bergen Bagels. 

J. is a thoughtful and considerate host. We are already planning another visit for late October. "
7097,13278072,24/5/14,13984386,Sebastian,"J.'s Apartment ist ein wunderbarer Rückzugsort nach einem langen Tag in Manhattan. Die ruhige Strasse und der grüne Innenhof wirken nach den hektischen Grosstadteindrücken sehr erholsam. Die nahe gelegene Dekalb Ave bietet eine Vielzahl an guten und abwechselungsreichen Restaurants. Wir haben uns in der geschmackvoll eingerichteten und gemütlichen Wohnung sehr wohl gefühlt.

7097,13694388,2/6/14,15434486,Jackie,We stayed here while visiting family in Fort Greene.  Location was perftect - close to the park and restaurants on Dekalb and Lafayette.  The apartment was very large and clean and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay! J was very easy to work with.
7097,13982368,9/6/14,8585134,Andrea,J's home is on a beautiful quiet street in Brooklyn. She was easy to communicate with and completely flexible about check in and check out times. The house is spacious and has everything you need. The back garden is beautiful and a nice change of pace for NYC. We loved staying here and would do it again!
7097,14806502,26/6/14,8216975,Sean,J was a very nasty and negative person. From the first moment we met I felt I had to go out of my way to be nice just to get her to feel more comfortable with me. Her place is nice I will say that but she is the only person I have ever had a problem with in my entire airbnb experience!

7097,23994091,16/12/14,22920004,Charles,"J is a welcoming and gracious host. The accommodations are exactly as described, and actually much better when experienced.  The apartment we had was the bottom floor of an exquisite brownstone, located in the middle of the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn. What we really liked, is the easy access to other parts of New York via the subway.  Easy walking distance to the Q (at DeKalb and Flatbush) which goes right to mid-town; the A&C (at Metro Tech) which goes right up 8th avenue through Times Square; and the G (at various stops) which goes to Queens through the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.  Plenty of restaurants and coffee nooks for meals and bagels within easy walking distance.  J was easy to communicate with, and went out of her way to help us out when needed it.  This is an A-one stop for a New York visit."
7097,24776788,2/1/15,24916681,Joe,"This is a great place to stay!  My wife and I stayed here for 2 days, over New Year’s, while visiting friends just a few blocks away.  We drove in and there was plenty of free on-street parking. We arrived early and found a great place to have a cup of tea and a bit to eat before our host arrived, exactly when she said she would (J was very easy to coordinate with).  
 
The place is beautiful – just like in the pictures.  The bed is quite comfortable.  As an insomniac, I was worried about the sofa bed, but I had no trouble sleeping.  The kitchen was perfect for what we needed (microwave, sink, coffee pot) – just keep in mind there is no oven or stove top. 

The neighborhood is fantastic, with plenty of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. I wish we were there in warmer weather to enjoy the garden.
 
My wife and I highly recommend this place!"
7097,25544954,19/1/15,13104928,Marci,"Our host was on site when we arrived and showed us around the apartment, pointing out specific things that would be good to know during our stay.  The apartment was nicely decorated and had everything we needed.  The location was terrific, right near our son and daughter-in-law, who live in Fort Greene.  We were able to walk easily to their apartment, to BAM, Prospect Park, and Pratt Institute.  
We really enjoyed our stay and hope to come again."
7097,27442804,4/3/15,7932698,Matthew,Great place! Warm and spacious for Brooklyn - has nice garden out back. Good location near the park and not too far from subways. Really enjoyed staying here and my father liked it as well. 
7097,29799886,12/4/15,1483390,Shaun,"J was very accommodating for my mom's recent stay in Brooklyn. The apartment was exactly as described: a very well kept, beautifully decorated and clean apartment in a lovely brownstone with a backyard garden. We especially enjoyed the location - right around the corner from Fort Greene Park and walking distance to a wide variety of restaurants, cafes, and, if you're around on a Saturday, the farmers market and Brooklyn Flea Market. Thanks J! "
7097,31672608,8/5/15,16837547,Genna,"Lovely garden apartment in great location in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Clean and spacious! The bed was a pull-out couch but very comfortable.

7097,32809479,22/5/15,25269953,Brad,"This space is not only perfect for parents but for anyone wishing to stay in Brooklyn.  We were warmly welcomed by J., the host.  This home is a carefully restored Civil War era Victorian Brownstone.  It is worth a visit to enjoy the interior.  We stayed in the bottom level which has three rooms including the bedroom  There is a kitchen area with windows that look out on a private garden.

The location is convenient with easy access to local restaurants, markets, and the subway.  We found our visit was enhanced as we were able to experience some of the local Brooklyn  culture.  It is within easy walking distance of Pratt Institute.

7097,43424446,19/8/15,9521049,J,"Nice location on a quiet street.  Apartment is located on the bottom floor of a charming brownstone with access to a nice garden in the back.  

The set up is a bit different than the pictures (bedroom is where the living room is pictured and living room is where the bedroom is pictured) but that does not affect the quality of the stay in fact enhances it as the room in the front can be darker for better sleep in spite of being on the street side.  There is a real bed (not sofabed).  Very nice and modern bathroom adjacent to the bedroom.  

Kitchen facilities were perfect for us; small refrigerator, microwave, sink and coffee maker.  Guests should be more mindful of future guests by leaving clean cups and silverware (we found coffee cups put back like they were clean but were not - the host should not have to inspect every cup, plate and piece of silverware on departure of every guest).

Wifi worked very well for us and there were lots of channels available on the tv.

Several Metro stops close by; getting into the city center is very easy. Nice diverse neighborhood where we felt quite safe walking home later in the evenings.

Host is very accessible if you need her and kindly offered the use of laundry facilities when requested.  

We found several excellent restaurants within walking distance of the apartment and lucked out on arrival to find a parking spot right out front.

This was our first Airbnb experience; we would recommend staying here and hope to visit again."
7097,46017263,7/9/15,41763679,Mary,"We enjoyed staying in this comfortable, spacious, clean unit. J. was entirely accommodating, and it was fun to be walking in the neighborhood and see our host out and about too. This is a great location, super close to Fort Greene Park, but also within walking distance of the Brooklyn Navy Yard (interesting guided tours) and just a bit farther, Brooklyn Bridge Park (fantastic views, great public spaces). Downtown Brooklyn and the subway are not far. There are plenty of interesting restaurants close by. Hope to visit again!"
7097,46706290,13/9/15,1474700,Josh,J. was great! She was super accommodating and flexible as I had some communication problems with my parents at first.

It was tastefully decorated and well-maintained. The neighborhood is great - centrally located with lots of restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores, and Fort Greene park is a block away. We would definitely stay here again."
7097,49767582,6/10/15,1785267,Antonia,"This was a beautiful, spacious place in a very nice neighborhood.  J. has decorated this so well and created a space that seems homey without being too obviously someone else's actual living space. Because she lives upstairs, you are not dealing with someone else's clothes and toiletries which often seems too intimate and invasive.  We did not need her help for anything since our son lives in the neighborhood but she seemed like she would be available if we had. We did not use the outdoor space but it looked lovely.  We would definitely stay here again."
7097,50291277,11/10/15,8640802,J,"Perfect for Us!  We have stayed in ""Perfect for Parents"", private upper floor, as well as ""Perfect for Grandparents"", private entrance garden apartment.

The space was very open and felt like a home away from home. I maintained contact by email and when I returned ""home"" each night, she had fulfilled mu requests. The apartment is very quiet and in a good neighborhood...near restaurants, a great farmer's market and...near my son and his family. "

7097,67562674,30/3/16,9144341,Jill,We loved the neighborhood.  We have traveled many times to Brooklyn and this is one of our favorite neighborhoods to stay in.

We would definitely recommend this apartment to others.

Our spacious rooms were in a beautiful art filled brownstone on a quiet street in a charming neighborhood. Parking was easy and there were excellent restaurants within walking distance. The beds were comfortable and the large garden area in the back was a great place to sit and relax in the afternoon. We look forward to returning. 
7097,71276280,24/4/16,62037175,Sara,"J. was a great host. Checking in and out was a breeze, and any questions we had were answered quickly. The pictures are accurate, and the place was beautiful, clean and comfortable during our stay."

It's a very nice apartment and garden, very comfortable. "

7097,103283748,21/9/16,49324455,Phil,"J was a perfect host - she let me in and gave me all information I needed without prompting.  Communication was great and the place is lovely - beautiful old brownstone with plenty of space and  great interior decoration.

Thanks for having me and hope I can stay with you again!"
7097,103826499,24/9/16,38953540,Gail,"J was not able to meet me when I arrived at her lovely apartment, but she made good arrangements for me to get the key.  I met J that evening and was very helpful getting me settled.
The apartment is big and very comfortable.
The kitchen was my favorite room.
I would stay here again."
7097,105154485,30/9/16,89736021,Tanya,J's place is fantastic! Great location. Comfortably appointed with everything we needed. Very quiet street in lovely neighbourhood. An easy 10 minute walk to the train to get into Manhattan.
7097,105660835,2/10/16,96100915,Casey,"This was our first stay with Airbnb and it set the bar pretty high. We were given a tour upon arrival to make us aware of all the amenities. The accommodations were warm and inviting, the mini fridge came in quite handy, and the shower was excellent. The television was big and cable was provided, but we were too busy with our trip to need this feature. Although the weather was quite gloomy, the outside garden area looked very welcoming. The bed was on the firmer side for my tastes, but my husband had no issue with it."
7097,106321421,5/10/16,346611,Nazanin,Jane was super accommodating. She met us later in the evening when we were able to arrive and she was so incredibly sweet and caring with my kids. This place is really perfect for parents though and I would definitely book it again.

7097,109123051,19/10/16,6507274,Madelon,"J's place is just as described. A lovely and spacious garden apartment in an excellent neighborhood.  It was very comfortable for my parents' stay. Even though it does not come with a full kitchen, which we knew - J offered them to use the kitchen upstairs. J responded quickly and answered all our questions and was flexible in our arrival time. I will plan on requesting her place on subsequent visits and would recommend it to anyone.

7097,111762353,1/11/16,5049754,Brett,Charming and spacious place that was perfect for my mother-in-law. Brooklyn garden unit in an authentic beautiful brownstone. Host was accommodating and communicative. Will book here again! 
7097,114892595,20/11/16,22571213,Dawn,"Our accommodations were on a quiet street in Ft Greene, handy to the Ft Greene Park, restaurants, cafes, and shops.  Our rooms were large and elegantly furnished; the kitchen small but perfectly functional; and the garden peaceful and calm. For a couple this is a great place to stay for weeks on end; but if others are  with you sleeping on the fold out couch in the other room, it is a bit awkward as the shared bath is off the master bedroom.
This is a lovely, stately, comfortable place to retreat to whilst in NYC.  Highly recommended.
"
7097,120316788,9/12/16,17292723,Allison,"Had a wonderful time a J's place. Very spacious, amazingly comfortable bed, and she everything we needed. Safe, quiet neighborhood, amazing location. Great restaurants and coffee nearby. Also would be great for anyone who can't handle many stairs-- it's garden level, so it's two steps down and that's it. Definitely would stay there again."
7097,123285908,28/12/16,9583338,Jane,"We have stayed here three  times, for a week each time. It is everything you could ask for in a getaway. It is homey, very spacious and beautifully decorated. The kitchen is on the opposite end of the space so you don't have to creep around in the morning if someone is sleeping. And you couldn't ask for a nicer host. The neighborhood is lovely, interesting and people are very friendly. You can easily walk to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in ten minutes, where we saw three first run movies. There are plenty of bars and restaurants and you are close to Fort Greene Park and public transport. You won't be disappointed!"
7097,131080748,10/2/17,17292723,Allison,"This is our second time staying with J and, as seems to be a theme, everything was perfect."
7097,141736708,4/4/17,6676589,Bryan,Jane has decorated this Brooklyn garden apartment in a way that synced with our own eclectic tastes in detail. The location was perfect for our needs when visiting a nearby friend it gave us our own space.

J's place is close to good stores, drug stores, a nice wine shop and good restaurants. The place is exactly as pictured.  We really liked the historical brownstone building.  We felt safe.  J was very responsive and helpful.  "

The place was clean and comfortable and more beautiful than the photos, as good as they were, depicted.
We'll look into this again next time we visit."
7097,150322777,7/5/17,459375,Deborah,"A very comfortable stay, close by to wonderful restaurants and transportation and located on a beautiful tree lined street. We would definitely stay there again when visiting family in Brooklyn."

Very roomie ....large bedroom with bath,  large living room but small kitchen with microwave and refrigerator only.    Clean and J was always right there if anything was needed.  We would definitely return.  It was perfect for us as it was only down the block from our daughter's place .   Hairdryer included .   Felt very safe in neighborhood and great eateries .   Love Brooklyn !  "

7097,178501441,5/8/17,300315,Daniel,Had a great stay. I booked this airbnb for my mother and myself. J generously made the pull out couch bed for me. The kitchen nook was a great place to have coffee in the morning. I love fort greene so i thought this was a great location.
7097,181362994,12/8/17,5041378,Whitnie,"J's place was, as advertised, great for parents! My MIL and Brother in law were in town to meet our new baby so we needed something close (we live in downtown Brooklyn) and spacious. The location was ideal and J was an exceptional host. She met me in person to give me the lay of the land, which offered plenty of space for the two of them. J had an extra room available at the time of their stay and graciously offered it as well at no extra charge. The garden was a big part of why we booked the place, and it was gorgeous. J had warned me ahead of time about the mosquitoes...I would recommend bringing repellent if booking in the summertime, they were pretty aggressive! Overall very happy with J's place and her generous hospitality. "
7097,187704341,27/8/17,121078214,Grace,great place to stay! Super cute and super attentive host!
7097,190574705,4/9/17,7837770,Delbra,J's place is the perfect place for us to stay when we visit our daughter in Brooklyn.  J is quick to respond and helpful with any questions.  We hope to stay there again in the future.

7097,193455562,13/9/17,341198,Alexandra,"The home is a comfortable, clean, large space with a lovely garden space. It is well decorated to feel like a warm home. Amazing water pressure and comfortable bed and seating. It's in an ideal location-- on a leafy, brownstone-lined street, in walking distance to restaurants, the park, and the subway.  A great way to experience Fort Greene and beyond."
7097,197718638,26/9/17,118524285,Tasha,"J, was a great host! The apartment was just what I and my husband needed. The location couldn't have been any better."
7097,203200454,14/10/17,28318682,Lexi,"This was EXACTLY what we needed. My family is scattered about Manhattan and Brooklyn, and when we come back to visit we really need to be in a central location that is a spacious ""home base"" for us. This location is the best! It's central to all the best places in the neighborhood and it's so easy to get into the city.  We generally don't spend that much time in the actual place, but this was perfect for coming in, relaxing, and having a comfy place to do our morning routine and sleep.

1) the bed is huge and comfy...and you should set an alarm if you need to wake up early because it gets SUPER dark. We slept so late the first morning because it was so cozy.

2) note that there is a kitchenette--no stove, but a coffee maker, and J. had a bunch of take out utensils and stuff like that for anything we might bring in. There's also a yard that we didn't have the time to use, but it's there. 

3) the wifi isn't as strong in the living room as in the bedroom, and my husband had to do work, but there is a couch in the bedroom so he was able to work in there. 

J. was super responsive and helpful with check in and check out. We'll be back.

Thank you!"
7097,206464976,25/10/17,93212382,Jaymie,This was the perfect place for our visit to NY. Not far from the subway to get to the tourist spots of the city - absolutely beautiful walks.  The garden was like you’re own private Central Park. J was a wonderful host and made us feel at home.

7097,257811721,27/4/18,14433882,Michael,"We were so lucky to stay in a place as beautiful as Jane’s. You couldn’t ask for a more beautiful interior, to get the complete historic Brooklyn experience. And the space is huge - the big bedroom, the en suite, the living room, and terrific kitchen looking out onto the beautiful back garden which is a wonderful and peaceful oasis (which you may well need after escaping from Manhattan).

Outside, the apartment is on a quiet street of Brownstones, but only a couple of minutes walk from great coffee shops, restaurants, bars, train stations, and the tranquility of Fort Greene Park.

Most of all, Jane is a wonderful host - wonderful tips and thoughts on what to do in the neighbourhood, and being amazingly helpful in letting us store our luggage.

We’d stay here again in a flash, and would absolutely recommend this amazing apartment to anyone.

Thanks Jane - can’t wait to see you again soon!"
7097,266852503,20/5/18,57051881,Tatjana,"Jane's place was the absolute best place that we could have stayed in Brooklyn.

In a beautiful neighbourhood near lots of coffee shops, restaurants, and parks!"

7097,278688888,18/6/18,70679890,Zan,"Beautiful apartment in the Fort Greene neighborhood. A very short walk from the park, subways, and many fantastic restaurants (get brunch at Olea, especially the eggs + salmon or the French toast that includes seseme seeds). After spending the day in Manhattan, I very much enjoyed sitting in the quiet backyard with lovely trees and ivy for an hour. The backyard is also quite visible from the living room and mini-kitchen, which makes the whole place feel like a great oasis. Only small thing was that the wifi  was a bit slow, at least in the bedroom. Ooh...on the plus side, also a very nice bathroom and shower. Easy to walk or hop on a Citibike to nearby neighborhoods too. Hosts we're very responsive and easy to coordinate arrival with. Overall we really liked our stay in Brooklyn, and definitely feel like this place was a part of that."
7097,282175974,26/6/18,158294026,Cathy,"Jane is a great host - she checked in with us during our visit to make sure we had everything we needed,  The flat is lovely, the street quiet, the neighborhood and park vey nice - a great respite from the hustle bustle of the city for those of us visiting from more rural areas!

John was an extremely approachable and helpful host throughout the experience and accommodated his plans to our very odd travel schedule (we got in to NYC at 11pm and left on a 4am flight). 

Superb location for all meals (Chelsea Market's dope by the way, and there's really good authentic Italian about one block up), shopping, and/or grabbing a quick drink.

Will definitely be heading back to John's on Horatio on our next trip to NYC."

7241,60660,4/7/10,135282,Lucila,"We had a great couple of days in New York and John's apartment had a lot to do with it. He was a delight to deal with: replying to our emails, giving us directions around the neighbourhood, and making it easy to get (and leave) the keys. The apartment is quiet, clean and in a great location. And along with a fantastic book collection and stylish furniture, the AC was an added bonus since it was over 90 when we were visiting. One of Airbnb's best kept secrets!!!  "
7241,66346,19/7/10,86761,James,"This place is so perfectly located,couldnt of asked for a better location, close to everything,the subway,all the restuarants and shopping.
The unit was very comfortable with a very comfortable bed, great water presure in the shower, and John was the perfect host, gave all the information that I needed about the area befor he left.
Thanks John, defenitaly will be back mate.

James."
7241,71855,1/8/10,132069,Chris,John is a great host.  The apartment is in a prime location in the picturesque West Village on the edge of the slick meatpacking district.  Subways to everywhere nearby and the Hudson River is blocks away for runners and walkers.  Truth is if you don't mind the walk up you can't beat this place.  And the walk up will keep you in good shape.  
7241,76085,9/8/10,78364,Anne," The location, the apartment, and the host are all fabulous. John responds to emails quickly and is very friendly and helpful. I loved the location, wandered the neighborhoods in all directions, the subway is very close and convenient, and it was quiet for sleeping at night. I loved the decor of the space itself, vintage flower paintings and wood furniture, the raised bed next to the window where you can gaze at the city lights at night. The best thing was feeling like a local for a week. I highly recommend this place!"
7241,82989,23/8/10,139370,Eduard,"Very nice apartment in an unbeatable situation in New York (west village). Friendly neighbors and tons of restaurants/shops around.
John is a good host. We had some problems (which had nothing to do with him) and he did everything on his hand to solve them.
I'd recommend the apartment to any couple or single person who wants to visit manhattan. It's got also a big table, which is perfect for writing (my job!).
"
7241,87213,30/8/10,186559,Carlos,"John was very nice and very helpful. He left several phone numbers so that we could find him for any question and at any time. The apartment is in one of my favorite neighborhoods in NYC. The bathroom is not the best because the shower doesn't meet my standards of hygiene but the apartment is bright, with a good bed, kitchen and a perfect location.

John es una persona encantadora y muy servicial. Nos dejo varios números de teléfono para que en todo momento pudiéramos lozalizarle para cualquier consulta. El apartamento está en uno de los barrios que más me gusta de NYC. El cuarto de baño no es lo mejor ya que la ducha no cumple mis estándares de higiene pero el apartamento tiene mucha luz, una buena cama, cocina y una localización perfecta.

"
7241,102560,22/9/10,154285,Livia + Flavio,"John is really a nice host. He's fun and even speaks portuguese!

Perfect location, near the High Line Park, subway, restaurants and shops. We had a great time at John's place. The view from the bed is great. Everyday I woke up and spent a little time watching the children playing at the park in front of the apartment.

If we come back to NY, we would definitely stay at Horatio again."
7241,110289,3/10/10,126332,David,"A lovely apartment in a phenomenal location. John, who is a passionate, creative and incredibly helpful person ensured that my stay was comfortable and stress-free.

I recommend this apartment without hesitation."
7241,114585,9/10/10,90452,Esther,"Hemos pasado una semana muy agradable en el apartamento de John! La cama era muy cómoday está muy bien situado, a tan solo unos metros de la estación del metro y a 2 paradas de Times Square.
No tuvimos el placer de conocer a John en persona pero el trato por mail y por teléfono fue inmejorable, muy agradable y dispuesto a ayudar en cualquier cosa.
Nos dejó las llaves en una tiendecita cerca del apartamento y sin problemas.
Esperamos poder volver pronto!
Gracias por todo Jhon!"
7241,125711,24/10/10,244782,Tine,"John's profile is very accurate, he is certainly a mellow person. We loved to stay at his place, which will only be even cooler when the playground outside is finished. I do not hesitate to recommend this place very highly."
7241,130174,31/10/10,123502,C,"AMAZING location!  The subway is so close, and there are connections to many lines.  The street is surprisingly quiet even though there are lots of great restaurants and shops nearby.  John was very helpful.  We had the BEST time!"
7241,147682,1/12/10,237307,Evgeny,"We had amazing time at John's appartment. The location is the best to get to any part of Manhattan (and the whole NY). The apartment is very clean and cozy, and even little funny. John was very helpful in any kind of quiestions. Thank you, John."
7241,152312,12/12/10,157785,Sarah,"The apartment was brilliant and John was fantastic to deal with. Friendly, honest and gave us great recommendations for obscure but incredibly delicious restaurants.
Perfect area to be in if you're visiting New york – close to markets, galleries, subway and restaurants. Can't recommend this place enough. Made our trip.
"
7241,176989,1/2/11,253542,Mirelle,"John was very welcoming and relaxed. The apartment was a great base for our New York holiday. Very close to L train station at 14th which helped alot when it started snowing. between West Village and Meatpacking district, there are heaps of great restaurants and bars nearby. 
There was a couple of hitches with the apartment (wifi and building issues) which John did everything he could to sort out. 
Would recommend this cute, functional, well positioned studio. "
7241,256075,9/5/11,449317,Annie,The host canceled my reservation 21 days before arrival.
7241,440640,13/8/11,554875,Luciano,The place was in a very good position. I really liked the furniture in the apartment. John is really nice and helpful. We'll come here next time we'll be in NYC! Reccomended.
7241,573002,27/9/11,506422,Andreas,"A trip to New York is always a great - no matter what. But when staying in an apt as super swell as John's, it's a life changing experience.

It's located perfectly in the meat packing district, a short walk from everything you will ever need. You can walk from the apt and straight into the very heart of Manhattan (think 5. avenue shopping district) within 15 minutes. There are lots of very nice restaurants and bars everywhere you walk in the neighborhood. The subways is just around the corner, not more than a five minute walk. 

The apt it self is very nice and clean as well. Perfect for a short and long term stay. We stayed for ten days, and it was all rosy. 

John was the perfect host and was very helpful in every thinkable way. He answered all our texts and e-mails promptly and was just great and friendly guy. 

The next time we visit NYC, we will not accept staying anywhere else than at John's place. A true gem."
7241,635337,17/10/11,674375,Veridiana,"It's obviously a guy's apartment. But it has the top 3 essencial things: PERFECT location, relaxing shower and confortable bed. As a bonus, John is super kind and friendly, aswered every single question we had and helped us a lot. Thank you very much, John! Hope to see you again soon. : ) "

7241,745784,27/11/11,173935,Darren,"We enjoyed staying at the West village. The apartment is located in an amazing area and it's really close to a subway, restaurants, Bleecker street, shopping, etc. John was great to communicate with. He was overseas and always replied to our emails on time. We would definitely stay at his place again!."
7241,906639,7/2/12,327868,Carine,"The location of John's apartment is the best one to knowing New York. It stays in a very cool neighborhood. It's near of a subway station, but you can go to a lot of amazing places by foot from there. The apartment is very comfortable and it has an excellent view from de bed to a little park in front of. I was there in the winter, and the heating system worked very well. John is a very interesting guy and could help us in every little problem. Besides that, he can speak spanish and some portuguese, what's may be very helpful if the guest is not so fluent english language (like me). I'd loved that place and I'll recomend, certainly."
7241,1049257,27/3/12,1501315,Indara,"We loved our stay at John's apartment. The place is small but really comfortable, we felt at home from the first day. The high bed is so cool to look out through the window at night while lying! And the location couldn't be better.
John was very nice, easy to reach and helped us with all our questions. We have already recommended the apartment to some friends who will be visiting NYC soon."
7241,1183377,26/4/12,1266385,Anna,"We had a wonderful time staying in NYC and at Johns studio - truly a gem, perfect location and surprisingly quiet (we slept with the windows open!). Nice to have an italian style espresso cooker, too. John is a great host, very sweet and caring, interesting and replied super fast to any questions. Overall a great experience!"
7241,1301771,19/5/12,1478378,Marijke,"The best location ever between Meatpacking and West Village. Bed and shower are good. Don't expect too much of the rest, but who needs that when you're in New York."
7241,1483653,15/6/12,1800706,Tomas,"John is a really wonderful host. Polite and easygoing all the time.
The apartment is exactly what he says: adorable. It is very comfortable with a  home feeling. The street is beautiful and there is a park just in front. The neighborhood is the best of NY for me, with streets full of trees, small buildings and good restaurants. Next time I go to NY I will call him!
Thanks John!"
7241,1540494,23/6/12,1795026,Catherine,"John's place is exactly as he says. It's a fabulous little bohemian hideaway seconds from Meatpacking and all the treasures of the West Village. It's small and simple, but a perfect way to enjoy this part of the city. John was a great host, despite being away when we visited. Can highly recommend a stay at John's on Horatio!"
7241,1875352,3/8/12,808757,Adam,We really appreciated the location and good communication with the host. Would stay here again.

7241,2227579,8/9/12,1980943,Eva,"John was a perfect host, easy to communicate with and quick to respond to emails. The studio has everything you need if you choose to cook their own food, as happened occasionally during our two week stay. Comfortable bed and functional bathroom and shower. The apartment was bright, we liked that it was high up in the house and had a nice view. The area is superb, perhaps the coziest in Manhattan."
7241,2451999,30/9/12,2513787,Pauline,"Nice and well-located place, we spent an awesome stay. You can reach in 5 min the high line or the subway.
The bathroom is quite old-fashioned but clean.
We enjoyed the raised bed : we keep in mind!

Thank you John for your kindness and your warm welcome "
7241,2585905,12/10/12,2140690,Maruja,"Excelente estadia en el departamento de John. El departamento es pequenio pero muy confortable y muy bien ubicado. El mejor barrio para vivir en NY. El edificio es muy tranquilo y la calle tambien a pesar de que a unas cuadras esta lleno de restaurantes lindisimos y el Chelsea Market, lugar imperdible.
A unas cuadras hay varias estaciones de subtes con las lineas para conectarse a cualquier lugar de la ciudad.
John y Cord fueron muy cordiales y solicitos. John  todo el tiempo me contesto en espanol haciendome las cosas mas faciles.
Recomiendo muchisimo el departamento  y espero volver pronto. Gracias John."
7241,2757989,30/10/12,2186602,Sylvia,"John's place was in a convenient location and definately felt like home! It was clean and tidy, and a pleasure to stay in.
John was always very helpful and easy to communicate with! Would definately stay there again when I return to New York city!
Thanks heaps!!!!!"
7241,2843230,9/11/12,3203612,Sam,"This was my first experience of Airbnb.  So I was very apprehensive!  However, John was a fantistic host and very communicative throughout.  
I travelled to NYC for the new york marathon which unfortunately had to be cancelled due to the after effects of hurricane sandy.  John kept me unformed prior to my arrival of the situation in the city e.g. the electric and heating problems.
I arrived in manhatten with most of downtown in a blackout.  However, John arranged for his friend (Cord) to meet me at the apartment to hand over keys and show me round the place (by candlelight!).  
After 2 days the electric and heating were restored which was a relief.  Although it was kinda fun to live by candlelight without TV for a while. :)
Johns apartment is exactly as seen in the photos and felt like authentic new york living! The futon was very comfy and a great design which I might copy! I've stayed in manhatten a few times and i think this was by far the most quiet place i've slept.
It's ideally located with restaurants, bars, shops and the underground close by.  I pretty much walked everywhere from battery park up to central park which was a great way to explore.  It's about an hour's walk to central park but if you're not as active there's 14st underground just round the corner and plenty of taxis around.

Overall, I had a great stay and would definately recommend John's apartment.  I'll be using Airbnb again based on this experience."
7241,2949949,24/11/12,157712,Patrick,"John was a great host and very accommodating. The apartment is in a great area, close to everything you could want from NY. Shower was great and the apartment was warm to come in to from the cold. A great place to stay."
7241,3146863,24/12/12,4195085,Brian,"Everything about my experience at John's place was great!  The apartment is wonderful, especially the natural light, open view and location.  John is extremely friendly and attentive before, during, and after your stay at his apartment.  I enthusiastically recommend his place on Horatio, and I look forward to re-booking it again very soon."
7241,3288945,6/1/13,4164708,Mikhail,"It is our first experience with airbnb. And we are very glad that it began so well! We were met by Kenneth, it was very kind and waited for us despite that that we couldn't call in advance to it because of problems with communication. The apartment very much was pleasant to us, in it you feel comfortably, not as in the apartment which often lease. As it has a convenient arrangement, near the subway and shops. Golden mean between the Areas of Soho, Italian, Chinese and a time the square. Let's be always glad to return to John."
7241,3353020,15/1/13,4462852,Joseph,"Had the most wonderful time staying at John's apartment. The location is PERFECT to see the city. It is central to Greenwich Village, the Meatpacking District & Chelsea and even though so close to these busy areas, it is so peaceful!

The apartment itself is full of character feels so authentically New York; great comfortable bed, desk/working space & a great bathroom (brilliant shower pressure - this is important to me!). The building is great, secure and well kept. 

John was excellent to deal with; replying swiftly and extremely helpful with my stay - I can't recommend staying here more!"

the apartment is exactly as John explains, and as you see in the photos. it is small, probably only good for a couple, but still very comfortable. the kitchen has all the basics. the bathroom is a little old, but functional.
the bed is fine, and has a great view of the street below. the apartment is also very quiet!
the whole place could have been a little cleaner, but this was not a worry. overall we had a great time, and would recommend it."

The apartment itself is small but comes well equipped (the kitchen is well appointed and has everything you need to either prepare full meals or just store and reheat leftovers) is exceptionally cozy and has a ton of character. In spite of being just a stone's throw away from the meatpacking district, 14th St, and 8th Ave, the apartment is quiet and peaceful - a great place to listen to sounds of the city without being overwhelmed by them. John was a very accommodating and helpful host. He was quick to answer questions, flexible with check-in and out, and provided helpful advice about the neighborhood. Thanks very much John - we hope to be back soon!"

I could not recommend this listing more highly. Doti rocks!"

She is so nice after 5 days I felt I was leaving home. This is THE true NYC experience, so close to everything and safe neiborhood we almost never used the subway. 1/2 hour walk max to most attractions.
The apparment itself is perfect as you get to live within a very well stoked library with all the quiet you need for rest.The house is surgery room clean and there is a feeling of comfort about it.
Sincerly enjoyed our stay with Doti, do not hesitate to rent any lenght of time.

Our room and the bed were very comfortable. We got to start our day with a delightful breakfast and end our day with talking and sharing our day's adventure with Doti. :)
Her love for the city and some our converations with her helped to put city in perspective for us as this was our first visit. She went out of her way to research things for us to do and places to eat (of course!:)) in NYC.

I recommend her place to anyone who wants to visit NYC and I would definitely stay there again.

The location is perfect, central and a few blocks from 3 different lines of subway.  We could hardly get a better location.  The room was perfect and very clean.  The air-conditionned was very appreciated.  The breakfast was excellent and very diversified: coffee or tea, bagels, cream cheese (3 different flavors), cereals (granola), yogourt and fresh fruits.  On our first day, one of us asked for orange juice and toasts.  As this was missing, Doti proposed to go right away to buy some for us.  Guess what... on the second morning, there was orange juice and toasts for us...  she even proposed us to cook eggs as she thought we had not eaten enough.  Doti is always doing her best to accomodate people and help us planned our day.  A few times, she searched the internet to help us better plan our day and to provide information on shows going on.  This is extremely appreciated.  Thank you so much Doti and be sure that if we go back to NYC we will book your place again.   Louis et Michel."

7322,7885,21/8/09,12777442,Henrike,"My daughter and I had a great stay with Doti. I thought the bedroom was surprisingly quiet, even though the location of the appartment is very central. It is only a hop and a jump to anything in Manhatten. We were VERY thankful for the air condition unit, since it was quite hot during our stay. Being out and about during the (hot) days, we greatly appreciated a refreshing shower, the comfortable bed, and the coolness of the room at night. Breakfast was very tasty; and additionally Doti had insightful suggestions and tips to make our stay unique and more enjoyable. Thank you very much Doti, for providing such a great space and welcoming atmosphere. It was wonderful to meet you!"
7322,8017,22/8/09,32047,Hal,"Doti is a great host, upbeat, erudite, generous with advice. She even had umbrellas to lend to travellers without the good sense to pack appropriately for NYC in August "
7322,8065,23/8/09,27500,M,Doti was an excellent host. She helped us figure out walking/subway directions and made suggestions when asked. She also provided fresh bagels for breakfast and always had coffee/water on hand. Her apartment has an elevator. The room itself did not have a lot of street noise. Her place is super close to the FIT. I would stay with her again. I was a bit nervous because this was my first airbnb experience. Doti made it great. 
7322,8231,25/8/09,23141,Diana,"Doti was such a charming and wonderful host! It is true that she takes the deepest care in making sure you will enjoy the most of your stay, and that you have everything you need for your breakfast! Her apartment is strategically located in Manhattan. It was a great place for our short stay and by the end of it we felt that Doti had not only became our host but our friend."
7322,8827,2/9/09,20340,Jenny&Michael,"We couldn't wish for a better place or a better host than Doti. We stayed for 5 days at Chelsea Perfect and it was just PERFECT. A beautiful and comfortable bedroom, amazing breakfast with fresh blackberries and raspberries and caring Doti who went out of her way to assist us with checking out and making online travel bookings and provided with great recomendations on places to see in NYC. We'll definitely stay at Doti's again on our next visit in NYC"
7322,9017,5/9/09,27633,Heather,"Me and my boyfriend had a great 3 nights with Doti, perfect hostess! She is friendly and informative, the room is amazing and spacious, really central location, great breakfasts! Couldn't have been happier, thanks Doti!"

7322,9787,12/9/09,22543,Kenneth,"I really enjoyed my stay at Doti's! She's a great host, very welcoming and the room has a super comfortable bed! Her place is perfectly located to visit all of NY; I definitely know where to go and stay again next time I'm in NY!!"
7322,10229,15/9/09,30632,Patricia,"The most gracious of hosts, informative, helpful and personable.  Great location.  Fabulously comfortable bed.  Great breakfasts and the home made whipping cream to go with the scones was to die for."
7322,10861,21/9/09,29810,Bob,"Very helpful before arrival and during stay to  understand what to do in and how to get  around in NYC.  Location is ideal for travel to key places and events by taxi,  bus or subway.  Lots  of restaurants in area.  They are a warm and friendly couple.  Room was clean; bed was comfortable.  Breakfast was great and included  fruit.  Lots of  books and stimulating conversation.  We throughly enjoyed our stay.    Bob"
7322,11285,25/9/09,27250,Johan,"High expectations after reading the reviews, but this was even better than we thought. We were supposed to stay 4 nights, but ended up staying one more night, and could easily have stayed longer. Our new friend Doti is the perfect host, bed, bathroom, location, breakfast, everything with the apartment is great - and don't forget to check up her own blend of coffee!"
7322,12217,3/10/09,14413,Terry,"I recently stayed with Doti for one week. My stay was very comfortable and the apartment is in a great location. All the other reviews are accurate, Doti is a great host. She is very perceptive to your needs whether it be recommending a local restaurant, offering her umbrella or researching directions for a particular destination.  "
7322,12723,7/10/09,31875,Helen,"The perfect stay, the perfect host. The location is fantastic, the room beautiful and comfortable but most of all Doti was an kind, thoughful and obliging host. She went above and beyond for us. We would love to go back."

7322,13843,17/10/09,25514,Catherine,"A really warm and welcoming place. Doti and Kerry are very friendly and helpful hosts. Doti went out of her way to assist us with checking out and making online travel bookings and getting information about various NY attractions. Great breakfasts and such a comfortable bed. It was so special to have a homestay experience with locals who were so generous in sharing their knowledge, insights and time. Highly recommended, it put a human face on the Big Apple!!"
7322,14141,18/10/09,44858,Samanta,"Kerry is a great host, friendly and helpful. The apartment is super clean. Location is excellent, close to many metro stops and in a lovely neighborhood. Coffee with hazelnut for breakfast is a plus :)
Thank so much!"
7322,14737,24/10/09,24333,Lea,"I can honestly say that I had the best time ever in New York much of which was down to staying with Doti and Kerry who were the most amazing hosts. I truly felt at home and the apartment and its location were incredible. Travelling to New York alone for a week I was somewhat apprehensive but Doti and Kerry made me so welcome and such a part of their family that my trip was wonderful. Doti and Kerry are incredibly knowledgeable about New York and where to go and what to see (Gotham Comedy Club is a must!)and the apartment is two streets (2 mins) away from 2 seperate subway lines making it easy to get anywhere in Manhatten, as well as close to amazing delis, cafes, restaurants etc. Chelsea Perfect is well....PERFECT and I cannot wait to go back! If you are thinking of going to New York then this should be the only place you consider staying."
7322,15061,25/10/09,47102,Olaf,"Doti was a wonderful host, providing us with a fantastic breakfast in a beautiful apartment in downtown Manhattan.
She also helped us plan our very short stay in New York giving us some great ideas for things to do and see.
We would definitely stay again when we come to New York again."
7322,16272,5/11/09,29667,Moira,"We have just returned from a 5 night stay with Doti and Kerry in Chelsea, we had our own bedroom with the most comfortable double bed I have ever slept in, we arrived on Halloween and did find our first night noisy due to the partying and Halloween celebrations going on outside. Doti and Kerry are lovely people with big hearts, they welcome you to their home and the apartment is perfectly placed for most of the sight-seeing.  "
7322,16404,6/11/09,42225,Louisa,"i had one night with Doti and it was lovely, nice bedroom with interesting furniture.  Doti was very helpful and professional about my stay. "
7322,16581,8/11/09,39084,Mary,"We had a wonderful time at Doti's.  It was very convenient to F.I.T., the bed was very comfortable, and my husband especially enjoyed the conversation.  We would definitely stay with Doti in the future."
7322,17087,12/11/09,52309,Brian,"Great spot and fantastic service.  Doti was cool as a cucumber.  I had a very trying day before arriving and was not displaying the most pleasant demeanor.  She wasn't phased, got me settled and comfortable and made the experience exactly what I needed.  I came from a hotel and this experience blew it away.  I slept great, had everything I needed and was offered help with some details that would have just been a hassle if I was at a hotel.  Strongly recommend.  "
7322,17313,15/11/09,45689,Charla,Thankyou very much Doti and Kerry for your wonderful hospitality.  We felt instantly at home in your home and loved our chats after our busy days sightseeing. All other reviews are accurate and say it all. We have no hesitation in recommending Chelsea Perfect to any prospective visitor/s.  
7322,17601,17/11/09,45709,Brian,"We had a lovely stay with Doti, and she was great with helping us with directions and places in the neighborhood to eat. Her breakfast was a real treat, and started off our days with warmth and cheer. Brian and Barbara"
7322,18278,25/11/09,37891,Paul,"I strongly recommend Chelsea Perfect!  Doti is a great host...she offers gracious hospitality while respecting privacy.  Her apartment is a warm, charming and welcome ""home"" in a prime location; the guest bed is superbly comfortable.  I especially appreciated the continual flow of coffee, the great advice on where to shop close by and the feeling that her goal was to make sure I was taken care of.  Chelsea Perfect is aptly named and I would recommend it to anyone.  -Paul "
7322,18636,29/11/09,47439,Jen,We stayed with Doti for the thanksgiving holiday and can honestly say that the room was great and comfortable and Doti was very very welcoming and helpful in every way! We will be coming back to stay at Chelsea Perfect next time we visit New York again. Also we loved the location we were in walking distance to most places if not the subway was close by. Thank you Doti!
7322,20434,15/12/09,52213,Kathy,My daughter and I stayed with Doti and Kerry for four nights in mid December. They are lovely hosts whose comfortable apartment is within walking distance of all areas of lower Manhatten and midtown. Breakfast was delicious and the conversation great. Doti truly enjoys hosting guests in her apartment and in her city. I hope to be able to stay with her again.
7322,22372,2/1/10,30955,Pauline,"5 out of 5
We so enjoyed staying at Chelsea Perfect. Full marks go to Doti for being the perfect hostess. She is kind, sensitive, thoughtful and incredibly helpful. Our stay lasted 9 days; there was never a minute when we wished we were staying any-where else. The convenient location of Chelsea Perfect combined with the care we received from Doti, made for a wonderful vacation in New York. We both highly recommend Chelsea Perfect for your accommodation in New York.

7322,24455,19/1/10,67180,Nicholas,"Chelsea Perfect lives up to its name...great location and Doti is an impeccable host.  My fiancee and I stayed four nights, but even after the first night we felt like we were staying with friends.  Doti and her husband Kerry are warm, friendly and laid-back, and did everything they could to make sure our time in NYC was a good one.  We were so glad we chose Chelsea Perfect over some cheap hotel room.  Even The Plaza hotel can't offer the real, human experience that you will get at Chelsea Perfect."
7322,24901,26/1/10,69893,Pam,"Believe the reviews! Doti,Kerry and the Chelsea Perfect were a wonderfully memorable experience. My daughter and I came away feeling like we had visited family. Our hosts were very attentive to our every need,whether we wanted to interact or have our privacy.Staying in an arty neighborhood with people who are representative of that community was a worthwhile experience"
7322,25698,8/2/10,61009,Sinead,"Doti and Kerry were wonderful. This was our first trip to NYC and they made us feel comfortable and nothing was too much. We were able to ask for advice regarding the city and they were both so helpful. Their apartment is in an ideal location for all sights and shops in NYC and Times Sq is a stones throw away but without the noise on an evening. It is 5 minute walk from the subway and fantastic diners/restaurants/bars and coffee shops recommended to us by Doti. Breakfast every morning was delightful and the coffee, fresh bagels and conversation was the perfect way to start the day in a perfect city. The bedroom was spacious and the bed lovely and comfortable! Staying with Doti and Kerry gives you a true New York feel and they are fantastic people. Doti is the perfect host and I would recommend Chelsea perfect to anyone! We can't wait to return asap!"
7322,26194,15/2/10,32775,Jean-Marie,"The place is well situated in the center of Manhattan, that means you get to almost anywhere walking. 20 minutes from Times square and the same at night to get back from the best jazz clubs our main interest. The appartment is not huge, the bathroom is shared, but Doti's comprehensive, smart and a sensible person. We felt some emotion leaving the place. Bill Evans played : ""We will meet again"" and we hope so (and Doti, as promised if you come to South of France I will lend you my scooter :-) "
7322,26786,18/2/10,79738,Pia,"We have had a great time at Doti's place. Her appartment is very nice and comfortable, located
in the centre of Manhattan. Apart from the famous sites one can visit in New York, and all the different touristic activities one can do, Doti's delicious breakfast (lots of fresh fruits, bagels, joghurt and cereals, coffe and tea..) definitely belongs to the things one just has to experience :-).

We won't forget Doti's hospitality, and if we came back to NYC one day, her place would be our first choice."
7322,26940,20/2/10,70404,Annamarie,"Staying at Chelsea Perfect was a treat. The home is unique and immaculately kept. Breakfast was great, the bed was great, and the water pressure in the shower was great. Conversation with Doti and Kerry was a highlight. I would not hesitate to recommend this listing. My family and I feel as though we walked away with the perfect New York experience and new friends.
"
7322,27598,26/2/10,59558,Brenda,"We had an excellent time at Doti and Kerry's apartment in Chelsea. She is a great host, made us feel welcome.  Also was very helpful in planning our day...she really went the extra mile. Thank-you so much, we had a wonderful vacation!!"
7322,28410,6/3/10,74935,Didit,I enjoyed my stay at Doti's place. We had interesting conversations while I enjoyed the delicious breakfast she prepared for me. And the location is fantastic!
7322,29770,16/3/10,77295,Andrea,"This was our first time staying in a residential B&B. Doti was a great host and laid-out a great breakfast each morning (with many great choices). She is a great conversationalist and knows the area well. She also participated in my fiance's marriage proposal scheme!

The apartment is in a safe and VERY convenient area of the city. We had a really easy time getting to all of the places we wanted to see without taking any cabs (we walked or took the sub, which was 2 blocks away). The apartment is a one-bedroom/one-bath (the living room doubles as their bedroom at night) and felt a little tighter than what we expected from the pictures, but there was enough space to move around and it's probably typical for New York. If you're used to sleeping in quiet, bring some (Website hidden by Airbnb) usually wasn't a problem, but there was one night/morning when street noise got pretty loud (that's NYC).

I would consider staying here again on our next trip and would recommend her to our friends!"
7322,31116,24/3/10,51709,Graham,This was our first visit to both the USA and New York. Doti greeted us on arrival as though we were old friends and made us feel realy at home. We were very comfortable in the apartment and Doti’s breakfasts set us up for our days walking round the city. The location is ideally placed for travelling up or down town – and we can definitely recommend it!
7322,32106,29/3/10,86212,Mia,"We just returned from a four-day stay with Doti and have nothing but positive things to say about our experience.  Doti's apartment gave us a real taste of life in New York City.  Her neighborhood is artsy and fun, her place is unique and homey, and she is lovely and welcoming.  We slept like babies every night in the lovely bedroom (something we didn't expect in such a busy city).  The neighborhood was quiet at night and we felt safe walking the Chelsea streets whatever the time of day or evening.  The breakfast has been mentioned, but I will say again that it was a highlight of our visit.  On our last day she made fresh cream and got us scones, as well as the yogurt, bagels and fruit she provided every morning.  We would stay here again for sure."
7322,32538,31/3/10,95295,Elizabeth,"We couldn't have asked for a nicer situation:  clean room, very comfortable bed, wonderful breakfast, excellent location. Although we shared a small apartment with our hosts,Doti and Kerry, we felt as though we were visiting old friends. It would be difficult not to feel comfortable with them.  We relied on Doti for a number of suggestions, from restaurants to shopping, and her advice was perfect.  We'll be back."
7322,32634,1/4/10,82486,Sharon,"despite we have been in NY only one night, we loved staying in Doti's place. The room was very comfortable and Doti and Kerry have been so friendly and hospitable, so that we felt like at home. We really enjoyed our stay."
7322,34316,9/4/10,68129,Ulf,"What a perfect way to get to know New York – and a New Yorker family. We spend more than a week in Chelsea, at Doti and Kerrys place. Close to almost everything in Manhattan which was the first and main reason for our choice of staying. Well, the other reason was “the prize was right”, compared to hotel. But as both reasons were fulfilled, there was another reason that made our stay super, the host family. They gave us the best of breakfasts, gave us a lot of useful information about the town, searched the net for more information and made phonecall for tickets, and we shared some time with interesting talks about different things. We stayed three in the bedroom but never felt it was to small. Bathroom and shower, shared with the host family, worked out nice. This was a great way of staying in New York.

7322,34740,11/4/10,73906,Christina,We had a lovely stay at Chelsea Perfect. The assistance with the city was great adn the bed was cozy! Quiet but convenient! 
7322,35764,15/4/10,103297,Kim,"Chelsea Perfect exceeded our expectations by a country mile. What a find! Doti runs a comfortable, clean, and well organized place in a great location, and she is a generous host. We wished we could have spent more time there on this trip, and we know where we'll aim for the next time. There's no need for hotels when something this good is available."
7322,35892,16/4/10,90833,Susan,"After a long day of travel and emerging from Penn Station to the thrilling density of Manhattan, it was wonderful to be welcomed into Doti's home. She was extremely gracious and attentive. I actually enjoyed a dinner with her and her friend Johanna at a little Indian Restaurant around the corner. To arrive in a new city, and within a couple hours, be sitting down, enjoying a meal, and sharing ""what I love about living in New York"" stories with two locals is a rare treat. Her place was clean and comfortable (including the bed!) She and her husband Kerry were super sensitive to my needs, both for privacy and for assistance. A wonderful beginning to my stay in New York!"
7322,36198,18/4/10,63870,Janice,"I just returned from New York after a weekend spent at Chelsea Perfect. Even before I arrived, I thought of Doti as a friend, due to her warm, concerned emails. I felt at home immediately. She provides everything a traveler could possibly need, including robes like those in fine hotels, use of a hairdryer, and current magazines about happenings in New York. She goes out of her way to prepare what you want for breakfast. I mentioned that I liked pineapple the first morning, and the next morning it magically appeared. Dot and her husband are very interesting people, and if you like books, as I do, you will be in heaven. They have the largest selection I have seen outside of a bookstore. I'm already looking forward to staying with them on my next trip to New York."
7322,37726,25/4/10,71758,Cathy,"From Doti's first warm greeting, I was completely at ease and felt like I was staying with friends. The bed was fantastic, so cozy and comfortable. The shower was great, and everything was provided (including the hair dryer!) The apartment is very well situated for going uptown or downtown, within 5 min of subway, 2 min of hailing a cab, 20 min walk to Times Square, and in a great neighborhood filled with food, arts, and great people watching.  AND, Macy's flagship 11 story store is 10 minutes walk!! The breakfasts were wonderful and made ""to order"", and Doti and Kerry are the most gracious hosts, there when you want to chat and invisible when you want privacy!!  Will definitely go back to visit. Thanks Doti."

Doti and her husband also went out of their way to ensure our stay with them and in New York was pleasurable, helping us to find nice restaurants and things to do etc.

She also provides the most amazing breakfasts - muesli, fresh berries, yoghurt, chocolate croissants, bagels, coffee etc! Thanks for being a great host Doti, we would love to stay with you again."
7322,71803,1/8/10,98847,Teri,Thanks Doti so much for your hospitality. You made me feel very welcome and comfortable in your home.
7322,75595,8/8/10,33359,Phoebe,"Doti was the best hostess and has the perfect place to rent in NYC. This was third time to NYC, but first time staying in Chelsea. We fell in love with Chelsea and are considering moving halfway across country to live there. Doti let us check in early,store our bags in the apartment, and offered us tea and coffee while the room was still in use by the previous guests. She was extremely helpful with recommendations, transportation tips, and was very detailed oriented. 

If you're looking for a safe, great location, and warm place to stay, this is the place. Oh, and did I mention affordable? Doti loves to travel- and so do we, so for any savvy traveler, this is the place to be. "

From the moment she opened the door my daughter and I felt welcomed and we instantly felt comfortable..Doti was very hospitable, her breakfast were yummy with lots of selections of muselis, fruit, bagels and eggs. Brewed coffee was always available. 
The bed was so comfortable and clean. Everything was perfect . Staying with Doti was better than staying at a hotel because it was much more personal. Highly recommend staying at Chelsea Perfect. Location was great, easy access to subways and walking distance to everything. Will be definitely returning back to NY and to Chelsea Perfect."

My husband and I loved staying in Chelsea. There is so much to see and do within walking distance. Much better than a hotel. Hope we meet again.

Doti asked what I wanted for breakfast and at what time, which I did not expect.   She is a good conversationalist and made me feel like I was staying at a friend's apartment."
7322,89851,4/9/10,65208,Phil,"Like seemingly every other person who has stayed at Doti's I had a fantastic experience!

She is the prefect hostess - welcoming, considerate and gracious and the room was very comfortable. The location is quiet and very well located, close to several subway lines and very good restaurants.

I know where I'll be staying the next time I'm in New York! "
7322,90698,5/9/10,208246,Andrew,"Doti was great, very hospitable, the room a little smaller and busier than I expected (the apartment has a lot of stuff), but all in a fine room for the night."
7322,94065,10/9/10,141525,Lorraine,We had a wonderful stay with Doti and felt we were leaving a friend when we departed.  We enjoyed the friendly and helpful atmosphere created by Doti and her husband and would love to stay there again.
7322,96236,13/9/10,215611,Arnold,"The room was clean, well decorated with a comfortable double bed, well lightred, with a window facing the street.  The bathroom, which is just adjacent, is kept clean tidy and well equipped with all essentials.  The apartment is filled with books that seem to occupy much of the space.  They cover a wide variety of subjects, if one has the time and inclination.   Doti enjoys being a hostess and has an interest in her guests. If I should need accomodations on my next visit to NYC I wouldn't hesistate to stay in her apartment in Chelsea.

7322,100775,20/9/10,158088,Carl & Ulla,"Our stay at Chelsea Perfect, was ....just perfect! A bit compact, but with a very warm welcoming from ""Doti"". When we were there she was having a new carpet installed in her living room which ""messed up a bit"", else the stay was very nice. The breakfast that was served was very to our liking, fresh fruit, bread, egg and ham if you wished.
""Doti"" also helped out to book tickets for a jazz concert and also for our bus tour to Washington. Thank you! "
7322,108449,30/9/10,137455,Cesar,"Definitely the best thing about our trip to New York was staying with Doti! She's a great hostess with whom you'll want to spend a great deal of time just talking and getting to know each other.

She was essential in our day to day planning and in helping us get the most out of our trip.

The room is great! Very clean, spacious and with a lot of privacy. And the location of the apartment is incredible. A very short walk to pretty much anywhere you want to go. And if you want to take the subway, there are 3 stops really really close by.

Seriously, there's no reason why not to stay with Doti!

7322,118804,14/10/10,125318,Jeff,"Staying at Chelsea Perfect was a great insight to apartment living in New York.  It is amazing what can be fitted in to a relatively small space! Doti made us very welcome and is very knowledgeable about all aspects of the city, including things to do and recommending very good restaurants, even addresses for knitting shops. Although we only stayed for two nights we had some good conversations and found out a bit more of what the “real” America is like. Thanks again – and you are welcome in Amport any time."

The experience really was like staying with a friend in the city."

We had a wonderful time staying with Doti, she is so warm, kind and inviting, we felt so at home in her lovely flat. The bedroom is spacious and the bed is really cosy. Breakfast is delicious, you couldn't ask for more. Doti is a font of information and what she doesn't know she's eager to find out for you. Thanks Doti for making our stay so special, I hope to be able to visit you again soon xox"
7322,132892,3/11/10,251374,Lindsey,We were really comfortable at Dotti's home. Both her and her husband made us feel welcome. We especially enjoyed the flexibility of coming and leaving as we were exploring NYC. The breakfasts were delicious. We would definately stay again with them. 
7322,141650,20/11/10,174005,Felicia,"Doti's apartment is warm and cosy and is the ideal base for me to start my adventure in NYC! Two different subway stations running five different lines are just a 5 minute walk from her place, giving one easy access to both uptown and downtown. There are also plently of things to do+see+eat around her neighbourhood... Chelsea market (for really good coffee @ 9th St Espresso, sandwiches @ Hale and Hearty, cakes, cookies.. and a couple of seafood markets), Billy's cupcakes, Whole Foods market (which is just round the corner from her place and is an excellent spot to buy groceries. I love the salad bars here!), and not too far off is Madison Sq Park (Shake Shack burger!! A must GO!). I was also able to walk further down to 5th Ave and Union Sq where there's a lot of shopping to be done. Most of the mid-brands that you find in mid-town can be found here as well.

Doti is a very warm and friendly person, who offered me a lot of suggestions on what to do, where to go and how to get there. She never hesitates to log on her computer to help me check out information of places, and even found out what is the luggage weight limit for my airline. Since I was traveling alone, it was a huge plus to come back in the evening to a friendly face and shared how my day went. Doti's place is clean and tidy, even though she has a big collection of books. The room I stayed in is big, the bed is comfortable, towels are provided and there's also a dresser to store my clothes. I would definitely stay with her again!"

7322,238207,25/4/11,233654,Ella,"What a lovely stay in New York!  Doti herself was away but her husband, Kerry, was a brilliant stand-in host and went beyond the call of duty to ensure I had a really comfortable, relaxed and easy time staying in their extremely welcoming home. The best part of each day was the time Kerry took to chat and answer my questions over copious quantities of toast and scrambled eggs, and excellent coffee from the brilliant old-style coffee percolator.  I really valued the privacy of the room I stayed in, and the fact it looked out over a really beautiful tree which was in full flower, and the tranquility of the street below - yes, it really WAS New York! - meant that I slept like a log, totally undisturbed.  What heaven!  The sense of security and comfort, combined with the convenience of having keys so you can pop back to the flat whenever you need, but most importantly being just a minute away from a really useful subway station, loads of busses, and even an easy walk to key attractions in the middle of Manhattan, meant that I felt incredibly lucky to be staying at Chelsea Perfect.  I can thoroughly recommend staying there!  It made my holiday and it'll make yours."
7322,246231,1/5/11,388496,Laurent,"Perfect location in a quiet area of the busy NYC; just a few step from the metro station, times square and many shops & restaurants.

This was by far a superior experience than staying in a hotel.  The location of Doti's apartment can't be beat; right in the heart of Chelsea, close to the subways, the Village, and the Piers.  Doti provided us with a very comfortable bedroom and plenty of privacy; breakfast and coffee in the morning was a plus!  Doti and her husband were great to visit with and provided helpful hints on navigating the city.  The overall experience was a ""5"" and we wouldn't hesitate to stay with her again!

Breakfast provided a great start to the day and we would often chat with Doti and Kerry, forgetting the time.  They are a font of knowledge and our chats covered many subjects including where to go for a great meal.
All in all a wonderful stay and if we go back there is only one place for us to stay..........Dot (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) s"

She researched and suggested activities for us, helped us figure out how to get around and indulged us in our favourite things for breakfast. All this in spite of having some difficult family issues to deal with at the time. Doti and Kerry's small and pleasantly cluttered apartment is in a convenient location for exploring Manhattan. The bedroom, well endowed with furniture and possessions, was comfortable, especially the bed, and very private. Doti is a warm and generous person, and I enjoyed her company and having a chat and a laugh with her. Thanks Doti, I hope to see you again sometime."

Hospitality could not be better: warm NY bagels and cream cheese was perfect for breakfast plus there was lots of fresh fruit, cereals and more...... all kind of useful tips to go around and survive in the city that never sleeps, perfectly clean, and more importantly the sympathy of a smily good morning from our hosts made us feel home.

For that reason we say:  NYC is ""aka"" Doti‘s place!!!

Elle nous servait des petits déjeuners délicieux, variés et copieux, était toujours à l'écoute de nos souhaits. Elle souhaitait également nous aider ou nous conseiller pour nos visites dans NY mais comme nous ne maitrisons pas bien l'anglais, ce ne fut pas aisé. Le lit est super confortable et nous avons  à chaque fois bien dormi.  En outre, l'appartement est super bien situé, dans un chouette quartier, très près du métro et pas loin du centre. Bref, allez-y et vous ne le regretterez pas.

The flat was comfortable. It is just minutes away from major metro lines, supermarkets, delis, coffee shops... So very practical. 
Breakfast was super, our favorite were the bagels with rich strawberry flavored cream cheese spread. :-) 
Watch out for the bed. It was a little too comfortable. Prime culprit for late starts to most of our days :-) Be sure to have an alarm clock handy.
If you forget to bring along a book to read. No worries. The flat is literally a library (for books in English). Doti also provides you with the latest magazines with info on what's happening in town.

Der Aufenthalt (7 Nächte) bei Doti haben wir sehr genossen. Sie war sehr nett und hilfsbereit und war sehr bemüht mit uns zusammen, den Aufenthalt in New York so interssant und abwechslungsreich zu gestalten. Die Unterkunft war sauber und zweckmässig.

Its location is truly convenient to everywhere.  The metro is steps away.  The surrounding neighborhood has much to offer.

The bed was comfortable and the bedroom had its own TV and WiFi access.   Doti placed chocolates in our room!   When our friend arrived in NY,  Doti  was able to accommodate her  in the bedroom on an  air mattress for two nights. The room became very tight, but we all managed just fine.

The flat is colorful , over stuffed and cozy.

The location seemed safe and was convenient for walking to the Empire State building and the metro.  It's two block from Trader Joes and Whole foods if you are too tired for restaurants in the evening.

We appreciated extra little efforts Doti was prone to making, such as helping us bring our luggage down to the waiting taxi when we left and fixing us a cup of tea when we had jet lag. Thanks Doti!

Generally, It's a good place and location to stay and very convenience to take a subway or ride a bus. Especially it's very easy to take an taxi around her place.

When we came home from sightseeing, we have warm and nicely folded laundry on the bed. It was not something we expect of her, but she did it graciously. We have good conversations in the mornings and we appreciate the little things she did for us, like leaving chocolates out for us in our room. The house is absolutely clean, the room is comfortable for 3 people, and we loved the large screen TV with cable in the room to come back to after a long day.

7322,2838353,8/11/12,3624797,Antoinette,"SHOCKING describes best the place, beginning with the odor the moment you walk in, the narrow hallway, where you have to walk sideways, the clutter, and more clutter in every room, etc. But that's not enough, this is a one bedroom and one bathroom apt. and the hosts sleep in the living room with curtains, which they close at night. The bathroom is shared, I never expected this. The picture is true to the place when cleaned up. However, t doesn't show the clutter on the wall opposite the bed, and it wasn't cleared of the clutter everywhere. DO NOT BELIEVE THE PICTURE. I HAVE THE REAL ONES AND THEY ARE SHOCKING. A bare third world place is more comfortable than this. I came home one afternoon to shower before the evening and found that clothes were drying over the bath tub, so no shower. I hate to give such a review because the hosts were accommodating, but I feel it my obligation to be honest. We had no room for suitcases, everything went on the floor, a few clothes were hung on a hook over the door. I never expected the hosts' would use the guests' room to store their own stuff upon stuff in every corner and on much of the floor of their apt. 

The building itself needed better housekeeping and upgrading, the location was convenient. So sorry that I can't recommend this place under any circumstances. If you doubt me, I took pictures because words can't describe the condition of this place. "

7322,2873867,12/11/12,4114005,Wolf,"Doti was very nice in renting the room to me at the last minute. I had a sudden cancelation with my hotel accommodations. 

Although my stay was short she made it more than memorable. Her place was just as advertised; and extremely warm, cozy, comfortable and friendly. The room and apartment were very clean and well maintained, with the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. The apartment is cozy and eclectic. There was unlimited hot water and the long hot shower was quite fantastic at the end of a long and harrowing travel experience. 

The location is great. Access to the trains, museums, shops and restaurants were all within a few blocks - easy reach. As well as Time Square and Broadway being about a three minute subway ride away – and where my meetings were. I had no problem in finding my way with her maps and directions.

She and her husband were very kind and attentive. I arrived at the apartment late with a weeks’ worth of dirty laundry and they insisted on taking care of it for me so that I could relax and still have fresh clothes for the next morning and before leaving on the next leg of my trip. Their attention to the detail of my needs made my trip much less stressful and ultimately more successful. I can’t imagine how I would have been able to handle the meetings I had to engage in the next day if they hadn’t taken me in and taken the time and interest to take care of me as they did. 

Sandy had left me on the road for nearly two weeks, my schedule a wreck and me emotionally bent! Chelsea Perfect was a soothing respite. I can’t say enough about a stranger who would take me in and do so much. I was sorry not to be able to stay longer to enjoy it, rest and recover and to assist in the recovering city. 

Chelsea and Chelsea Perfect are my headings when I am back in NYC! Who wants a hotel when you can have this; which is so much more?

7322,2883293,13/11/12,396829,Daniela,"Whenever I come to New York City I stay with Dot. So I have been using her Bed & Breakfast already 7 or 8 times in the past couple of years and it is always exciting, and feels so much like “comforting cozy home” that I do not want to leave. In fact it has been my home for 2 months when I did an internship at the United Nations in 2010 and I can say that staying with a host for that long is really the acid test for an accommodation and a friendship. What can I say? I always return with excited anticipation.

There are so many things I love about Dot and her apartment that I am afraid the space provided here will not suffice to share all of them. First, Dot is a wonderful, warm, comforting person. She goes above and beyond to make her guests feel welcome and is extremely considerate, respectful, and accommodating. You can ask her for everything and she will try to get it, find out about it, and organize it for you instantly. 

Dot is also really flexible. There were times when I poured my heart out to her, and there were times when I wanted to be left alone, there were times when I asked her for professional advice, and there where times when we laughed together and had fun. “Everything goes” with Dot. 

For NYC the apartment is pretty spacious, and Dot is respectful of personal space So much so that most of the times it feels like you have the apartment to yourself, even though she is there, working quietly from her couch, yet always approachable for questions and concerns. 

The apartment is truly beautiful and comforting. Dot has worked creatively in many areas and you can experience her sense for art, interior, antiques and decoration in every season. Since I have been there many times I am always looking forward to novel ideas decorative arrangements she composes. Among colorful accents, yesterday it was an arrangement of fresh flowers and herbs that gave a natural, fresh, and festive scent to the place – I loved it!

Speaking of natural – Dot will always provide you with organic foods. She takes great interest in green living (which as European I appreciate) and sustainable, clean food. She goes to any lengths to provide you with organic fresh fruit, fresh bagels, and loads of other organic delights to your liking (she really gets up at 5AM to get these things fresh daily!) that come beautifully arranged and decorated on your breakfast table. Also, her coffee and teas are organic, yummy!  

Truly, I am picky about my living space because it is an important “home base” wherever I am and I need personal space and sometimes a guide or friend. If you are looking for comfort, peace, nourishment, and easy-going communication, book with Dot. I guarantee you a great experience and a “spa” for your body, mind, and soul. I LOVE DOTI.

7322,2899456,16/11/12,4148722,Claire,"Dot definitely came through on her promise -- this WAS the perfect storm retreat. When I stayed with Dot at her ultra-cozy Chelsea space, I was going into my third week of being displaced from the storm. After spending many a night on friends' couches (eight in total), I was looking for a warm bed with a little personal space where I could recoup. I couldn't have been more happy with what I found. Firstly, the bed is amazing. I haven't fell that fast asleep in a long time. In the room, there is a gas fireplace and cable TV -- a real treat! Dot also has chocolates on the side-table and lush bathrobes on the door, plus all the bathroom necessities. What's more, Dot & her husband Kerry are a sweet, sweet couple. I very much enjoyed chatting with them about books (their walls are lined with them for you to read!) over a delicious organic breakfast the next morning. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! "
7322,2910264,18/11/12,4122949,Lorrie,"I am so happy that I chose to try out airbnb and that selected Clelsea Perfect for my stay in New York.  
The location is great.  Close to so many things and near my meeting.
I love the atmosphere at Doti's.  It is like a charming friendly Inn and yet you are in the city.  Doti and Kerry were great hosts.  They were respectful of my work needs and helpful with information about the area and local activities.  I felt so comfortable visiting with them.  I feel like I have two new friends.
I am very picky about cleanliness, especially in the bathroom.  The room and bathroom were immaculate.  The bed was cozy and the bedroom has a little electric fireplace to give it a comfy feeling.  I wish I could have stayed in bed and read a book but I had to get to business.  Maybe next time.
Now, the best part.  You will not get a fresh, organic and healthy breakfast like this anywhere I know of.  It was delightful to enjoy fresh berries and scones and chat with Doti.  And the coffee is great!
I gave this listing the highest rating because of the location, the hosts, the lovely clean accommodations, the atmosphere and the delicious breakfast.  All round it was a great stay.  I plan to return soon but to add in additional time to enjoy Clelsea Perfect and my new friends, Doti and Kerry.
I recommend that you try this airbnb.  You will not be disappointed.
 "
7322,2916779,19/11/12,196509,Deirdre,"Doti's place was just as described -- a very large, comfortable room in a lovely neighborhood.  Doti and her husband were very kind and prepared us delicious healthy breakfasts every morning (fruit, yogurt, muesli -- just as we had requested!  She had emailed to ask us before what we would like.)  The place was incredibly clean and Doti was very attentive.  We would definitely stay here again -- highly recommended!"
7322,2974311,26/11/12,4177014,Laurel,"Doti was super accommodating and something even more difficult to come by these days – genuinely caring about our comfort and well being.  When we showed up late to our stated arrival time, she expressed concern for our getting a little lost on the way there! (This was a result of sleep deprivation - as her home is central and easy to find.)  I am an artist and I love eclectic things, reading, and Doti's home told many stories through the abundance of books, art, and other items around the apartment. If you prefer minimalism, this may not be the place for you. If you like an experience, would enjoy meeting caring New Yorkers (Doti and her husband were both kind and welcoming), and enjoy staying in a room that feels as though it was made up just for your comfort, then this is the place for you.  Doti and her daughter (who was visiting) also helped us to plan a few of our stops, and to get student tickets to the New York Philharmonic ($15 each instead of $150)!  Our short stay (2 days only!)  in New York would not have been nearly so marvelous had we not stayed with Doti at Chelsea Perfect.  I hope to return again, as I feel I have a new friend in New York!  I'm also inspired to redesign my own room to capture some of the cozy comfort that Doti's guest room had.  Extra bonus: Doti was always ready with a hot cup of coffee, she provided a lovely New York bagel breakfast and most importantly, a safe, super comforting environment to come home to on a fast paced trip to the city that never sleeps (but always sleeps in).

7322,3067657,11/12/12,4243794,Adam,"We stayed at Doti's for just one night and it was perfect. While Doti had a personal emergency and had to quickly skip town, her husband was present and was an excellent host. The room and the apartment are as comfortable as the her photos appear. The hosts maintain the ""B&B"" mentality, operating more of a bed and breakfast. Note for breakfast aficionados - the breakfast provided is of excellent quality. The apartment is within a few blocks of two metro stops and is in the heart of Chelsea. Staying here was a pleasure and we hope to visit again soon."

7322,3114109,18/12/12,4212509,Gavin,"Simply wonderful! This was our first time using airbnb and will definitely not be our last.
My girlfriend and I were in NYC for a December weekend and Chelsea Perfect was a fantastic base for our trip. Doti and Kerry are wonderful hosts. 
Doti was fantastic during the booking process, responding quickly to queries and providing lots of helpful information.
Although we did not get to meet Doti, her husband Kerry made sure we felt very welcome in their home and was extremely helpful and friendly, while at the same time giving us the space we needed to come and go as we please, etc.
Doti and Kerry have been doing this for a while, and it clearly shows with their incredible attention to detail and willingness to help with all aspects of our trip. It seemed like they had thought of everything. Kerry went to fetch us fresh bagels for breakfast, delicious!
The room is cozy, spacious, and the bed very comfortable, definitely as advertised.
Location is brilliant, within walking distance of SO much, and subway stations are mere minutes away, ready to whisk you to NYC destinations further afield.
Cannot recommend enough. We look forward to staying again during our next visit to Chelsea!"
7322,3126950,20/12/12,358010,Brian,"Was on my feet all day prior to fetching up at Doti's at 11:00 PM.  Easy to find the building, easy to get up to 4th floor apt.  Said hello, said goodnight, went to bed, fell asleep in maybe 20 seconds.  Woke at 6 the next day, enjoyed a truly outstanding cup of fresh-ground coffee with Kerry (Doti was away), and was out the door for the train.  Takeaways are:
1) Really comfortable bed.
2) Significant # of books to peruse on next visit
3) TV remotes work  - uncommon
4) Did I mention the coffee was exceptional"
7322,3245574,3/1/13,1951216,Anna,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed a really relaxing and comfortable time with Doti at the very start of the year.  Her apartment is warm, well-organised and nothing is too much trouble. Doti welcomed us with a lovely cuppa and a good chat (it was New Year's day and bitterly cold outside). She is a very warm and giving host who clearly enjoys meeting new guests from around the world. The bed was SUPER comfy too and the breakfast was out of this world. I'd definitely recommend her as a host. She's very experienced and knows what guests are looking for in a comfortable stay."
7322,3351500,15/1/13,1827537,Kathrin,"Even though I stayed only two nights at Doti's place, it felt like entering another world. Chelsea Perfect is indeed the perfect name for her lovely place. I was overwhelmed when entering my room and if I didn't have to explore New York, I would have loved to just stay in that cosy bed by the beautiful fireplace. The location is also simply perfect - very close to the subway station, walking distance to Chelsea market or the Flatiron building, lots of great restaurants around.
Above all, Doti was a great and very welcoming and caring host. You can either decide to have your privacy in your cosy room or have very interesting conversations with Doti. Two perfect days at Chelsea Perfect! "

Very nice and helpful.  Many thanks to them for a pleasant visit.  Location is great.  We were able to walk to almost everything without too much trouble.  As vegans, we were able to find plenty of places to eat in the area.  Doti and Kerry always had a nice breakfast option available for us as well.  "
7322,3935839,29/3/13,4523263,Britta,"We my 15 year old daughter and I left cold and snowy Denmark in the middle of the night - to go to unknown NYC.
We ended up in a fantastic warm and welcoming place in the middle of what became our NYC. Chelsea.
Doti was so nice and had so much to give. It was like visiting family in a strange city. She would have answers to all kinds of questions.
She cooked whatever we wanted for breakfast. And that goes for the 15 years old as well. 
Different tea every morning - fresh fruit - bagels - etc.. it was great to be able to experience NYC every morning after breakfast.
She helped with reservations, she knew which places where close because of Sandy, before we came we mailed to have her help us with different things.
She was so interested and asked questions so that she was able to come up with ideas for us to try when we were there.
If she wasn't able to cook for us, Gary did or he pick up the best homebaked bread :-)
Hopefully we will be able to come back and stay, we weren´t finish with NYC when we left and we have tons to talk about with Doti and Gary.
Thank you for making our NYC trip so memorable.
Chelsea Perfect is the best place we could have been, so glad we found it.

The room was very comfortable and quietly secluded from the rest of the apartment. Also, given that the location is right in the heart of Chelsea, I was pleasantly surprised with the relaxed neighborhood feel and quiet. Everything is literally at your doorstep, or at most a very short walk away (restaurants, services, access to any of a number of subway lines, the High Line and - of course - galleries). Breakfasts - complete with Murray's bagels - were a great way to start the day. My only reservation in recommending so highly, is that it will probably make it more difficult for me to book to stay again in the future ;-)"

For our first trip to New York, we couldn't have booked a better place than Doti and Kerry's lovely bed and breakfast accommodation. Chelsea is lively but also a refuge from midtown bustle, and has good subway access. Doti and Kerry are kind and generous hosts, and Doti's breakfasts are delicious and tailored to what you want. They are always ready with useful info and advice about how to access the neighbourhood and the city's amazing resources. And the accommodation - a lovely bedroom with access to e rest of the apartment - and plentiful breakfast has to be one of the best value deals in town. Highly recommended for couples and singles."

The place was beautiful w/ many antiques, which made it feel like a true country inn.  The room was spacious and exactly as you see in the pictures.  Breakfast was served in real china and she really put out a spread.  So if you want to feel like you are staying in a country inn  I highly recommend it.

Nothing was ever too much trouble a great breakfast and coffee was always prepared for me when I woke up  (I felt very spoilt). 

 I feel like I have made a new friend from our wonderful chats over my week here. I also loved the hundreds of books that filled the apartment giving it a very home like feeling when getting home after long days of sight seeing. 

The room is huge by NY standards has great air conditioning if you are visiting in summer and you have complete privacy from the rest of the flat. The location is great and safe and I found it very easy to access the subway.

Fortunately we were able to book Doti's amazing place. Her apartment is in Chelsea, very convenient to everything. We walked mostly, but could have easily gotten on various subway lines. There are too many restaurants  and shops to name in walking distance. It was vibrant, but not loud, and we always felt safe. The bedroom is much bigger than we though, and Doti has thought of everything even robes and slippers! And she provided breakfast every morning and was kind enough to serve us on our schedule.

7322,106321013,5/10/16,1104681,Arnie,Doty is warm and welcoming.  We had wonderful conversations and she made me feel that her apartment was mine for the duration.
7322,107796401,12/10/16,87127334,Richard,"We didn't know what to expect, but Doti was a very accommodating host.  Breakfast was a great treat and she made us feel at home in the short time we were there (we usually we were out and about and only at the flat for sleep).  Would definitely stay again."
7322,108878168,17/10/16,21983871,Paul,"From the moment I arrived I knew I was in the right place. Doti welcomed me into her super comfortable home and we began chatting like old friends meeting after a long absence. The bedroom is exactly as the picture and as comfortable as it looks. I was asked what I might like for breakfast and was treated to fresh, warm bagels, cream cheese and coffee. Her location is great for everything in Chelsea so 'Chelsea Perfect' fits the name. Thoroughly enjoyed my two night stay and found a new friend too! Please book with Doti for a really delightful and delicious stay."
7322,113818980,13/11/16,89158149,Amberlee,"Doti is a gracious host and has traveled a lot. I'm sure she has some excellent stories, though our mere 24 hours in the city kept us from hearing them. The place is lovely, and in a convenient location. Doti is very accommodating and was a lovely host."
7322,124335344,1/1/17,69942952,Joel,"We had a very nice and pleasant stay on Doti's place.  She greeted us with much warmth and kindness from the time we arrived to the moment we left.  She won't hesitate to help the guests in any way she can, we really felt that we were in good hands.  With a great host in a perfect location in NYC, Chelsea Perfect is truly AMAZING!!! Thanks Doti!"
7322,127183370,16/1/17,66553362,Margaret,"Doti, was friendly and helpful. I couldn't have found a nicer host. Two thumbs up. "
7322,138625099,20/3/17,98071590,Julie,"We had a great experience with Doti at Chelsea Perfect. Our flight was late, we were hungry and she was patient and helpful in suggesting a nice place for us to eat when we landed.   

The accommodations are clean and comfortable - just like being home. The location is excellent, close to subway, shops and restaurants.  The breakfasts that Doti prepares are delicious!

Doti is an accommodating hostess, very nice and helpful. We plan on staying with her again!!"
7322,141541874,3/4/17,116718595,Heidi,"Doti has a small apartment in Manhattan, which was conveniently located near the pier where we were attending a wedding. Convenient to subway as well. She provided us with chocolates and water in our room and with coffee in the morning. We were only in the city for one night and she was very accommodating during our stay. "
7322,142829806,9/4/17,78485891,Kelley,"Doti is a fantastic hostess. She was attentive and very kind. It was wonderful to wake up each day to breakfast, coffee and conversation. 
We felt like we were staying with a true friend. 
The neighborhood is great, and within easy walking distance to so many great places in Manhattan. Subway access also is easy. 
Overall a great experience from beginning to end. "
7322,145886044,20/4/17,113837998,Rrrr,Dot is the perfect host and made us feel very comfortable.  We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay!

Elle nous a servi des petits déjeuners différents et excellents chaque Matin .
Elle nous a donné de bons conseils pour notre visite de NY.
Nous avons partagé de moments très agréables, elle a même pense à mon anniversaire en m'offrant un gâteau.
Elle est adorable 
Je la recommande ++++"
7322,151005102,10/5/17,2977544,Molly,"Doti was such a kind and accommodating host! Her home is cozy and welcoming and a great place to relax after a hectic day in the city. The room was clean and comfortable, and we had wonderful conversations with Doti over breakfast (which was delicious). We will definitely be staying again when next in the city! Thank you Doti! :)"
7322,151949413,14/5/17,1294678,Daniele,"Doti's aprtment was very well situated for our needs and fun in NYC.  Doti was very accommodating about us leaving our bags after checkout and was great about communicating.  Breakfast was included and was perfect.  We enjoyed spending some time getting to know Doti, as well as her son and granddaughter, who were visiting briefly.  Although the arpartment is very full... of books and other items, the bedroom had a light and airy feel.  Doti, thanks for everything! "
7322,162571561,21/6/17,29668972,Helen,"Jag och min son Oskar bodde hos Doti i fem nätter och det gav vår resa en särskild guldkant. Doti är en omtänksam värd som gör allt för att få sina gäster att trivas. Hos Doti bodde vi centralt i en trevlig New York-lägenhet med fantastiskt bra läge i Chelsea. Vi fick dessutom mycket goda frukostar, tips på restauranger, sevärdheter och kommunikationer och inte minst, möjlighet att umgås och finna en ny vän.  "
7322,165028584,30/6/17,120940401,Frithjof,"Alles, was bisher über Doti geschrieben wurde, war glatt untertrieben! Sie ist so wunderbar, dass man eigentlich etwas negatives schreiben müsste,  um das nächste Mal in New York wieder die Chance zu haben, bei ihr wohnen zu dürfen.
Ohne Zweifel ein tolle Gastgeberin.
Einmal bei ihr, braucht man nie wieder etwas anderes zu suchen, wenn man nach New York reisen möchte."
7322,248038876,30/3/18,148144865,Josh,"Very thankful for accommodating us with last minute travel change of plans.  Host was very gracious in providing breakfast,  coffee, and snacks and warm hospitality. Excellent location close to subway lines. Thank you!"
7322,252644821,11/4/18,47423426,Sebastián,"La estadía fue excelente desde el primer momento.
Kerry nos recibió muy amablemente y enseguida nos hizo sentir parte del hogar. Disfrutamos mucho compartir charlas y conocer mucho sobre la historia y la cultura del país.
El departamento tiene una ubicación privilegiada, muy accesible y cerca de muchas atracciones, medios de transporte y negocios varios.
La comodidad es superior. La habitación está alejada de las áreas comunes, lo cual permite tener privacidad si se desea. La cama es comodísima, ideal para cuando llegas de caminar durante todo el día.
Todo está muy limpio. La ducha es ideal para sobrevivir al frío de la ciudad y la cocina tiene todo lo necesario para preparar lo que se desee.
El desayuno merece un apartado especial. Cada mañana teníamos el desayuno preparado de acuerdo a nuestros gustos (café, frutas, tostadas, bagels, huevos, cereales), ideal para iniciar el día con mucha energía.
En resumen, recomendamos 100% alojarse allí, por la calidad del lugar y la calidez y amabilidad de los anfitriones."
7322,254879927,18/4/18,44428900,David,"Doti's place is a great value, for Manhattan. The location works well for me. My host was very friendlyand informative. I would certainly stay here again."
7322,257838770,27/4/18,22943422,James,"We were in New York for the Tribeca film Festival, in Chelsea and TriBeCa, and this was a great location for us! A very good value. Doti was out of town, but her husband, Kerry, was very flexible and helpful, and made us very nice breakfasts to order each day."
7322,261996461,7/5/18,161579435,Melissa,"We had a wonderful weekend staying here in Chelsea.  Kerry was helping us while Doti was out of town, but Doti still emailed and checked up on us. They were both so helpful in what to do while in the area.  I would stay here anytime I was in the area again."
7322,264273660,13/5/18,31457954,Madilyn,"The hosts take great pride in their home and rightly so... you will feel very welcomed in and part of the family. The communication prior to arrival and throughout the stay was excellent and they were very hospitable, offering anything we needed and more."
7322,265298676,16/5/18,11890637,Rosemary,"If you have ever travelled in Europe, and stayed in a city flat, then this very similar. Look carefully at the pictures, because the hostess uses her space wisely and efficiently as all walls are utilized. The bedroom is huge. In fact, it is bigger than my hotel room at HGU.  The power strips on each side of the bed are accessible for all your electrical needs. Antique furniture is adorable and the mirrors on each side of bed are handy as the bathroom does not have a power outlet. The dining area is quaint, the kitchen compact. Coffee very good. Host and hostess are friendly and want to meet your breakfast preferences, but. Their specialty is local bagels with cream cheese and also bagel egg sandwiches. They have tips galore!  I needed a cobbler to fix my shoe, and was recommended  a close and reasonable one. Directions? I was pointed quickly in the right direction. By the way, the locations is ideal close to public transit and minutes away from everything. This apartment is shared with the hostess."
7322,265843536,18/5/18,54382166,Julian Antonio,"Great place to stay that’s overshadowed by the even better host. Doti was so warm and accommodating, and it really stood out among all the airbnbs that I’ve stayed in. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in New York."
7322,267411806,21/5/18,36817673,Donna,First time we have shared a home and it couldn’t have been better. Most gracious hosts who were more like family!  Her breakfasts were wonderful and the bed was very comfy! Also very helpful with directions etc

7322,268315966,24/5/18,105490677,Mark,"Very clean, well-equipped room and amenities. Such a gracious host.  Perfect location, close to everything... or close to a train that will take you to everything . Literally had everything you could ask for in an AB&B experience.  Highest recommendation!!  Don't stay in a hotel when you can stay here.

A lovely private room with antique furnishings, comfortable bed, delicious breakfast ( fresh fruit,  eggs, bagels and more) and best of all, our hosts Doti and Kerry- kind, generous, brilliant, so helpful, fascinating folks!  We feel like they are our new family in New York. Great location - plenty  of cool shops nearby,  great restaurants,  close to transportation, and the Highline.  An ideal experience in every way!"

Breakfast was prepared each morning which is rare and Doti’s husband, Kerry, did a great job of giving us some local tips to enjoy the city. Would definitely stay here again!"
7322,276345659,13/6/18,21365664,Chris,"Chelsea perfect is a good name for this listing. Great location easily accessible by subway and located in the heart of a great neighborhood. The hosts are warm, generous, and have a great history of defining hospitality and the Airbnb model. The bedroom is a classic, very comfortable, and that room and the bathroom are immaculately clean and well appointed. Looking forward to going back soon!"
7322,277490684,16/6/18,11486903,Edwin,"People like Doti & Kerry are the reason I love to travel with AirBnB: they’re caring, interested and enabling you to live as a local for a few days.
Our stay in NYC was brilliant and Kerry prepared us an excellent breakfast every day. The house is located near various subway lines and is a great base to explore the city from.
Hope to come back some day !"
7322,279047405,19/6/18,21365664,Chris,"This was my second stay and it may become a regular spot for me. Super clean, great communication, very nice hosts, and a great location."

7322,281806941,25/6/18,53303874,Ant,Doti’s place is great. I came late from a flight and booked last minute and she was willing to accommodate me with a smile.  Her place is clean and the space is very comfortable.  
7322,291249583,15/7/18,6908381,Eun-Ah,"I made a reservation for my friends and they really loved this place. They said both Doti and the place were so lovely. Additionally, I was so much impressed by her efforts to communicate with her guests. She not only fully informed the important things in regards to staying at her place but also cared about what the guests wanted and was willing to be flexible to accommodate the guests’ need or request. I hope to have a chance to stay at her house myself in the future."
7322,292273142,17/7/18,10058321,Molly,"The room was very comfortable and provided everything I needed. Doti is very attentive and generous with her time, breakfasts, snacks and offers to assist. Having been a frequent user of Airbnb, this was my first time in NYC. I think this gave me a better understanding of typical lifestyle for many people living in NY flats. Doti has purposed every bit of the space. She has a collection of antiques and books that she lovingly displays in this Chelsea apartment. Communication was easy. I enjoyed walking to the Highline one morning and this neighborhood is convenient to many attractions. "

7322,294176755,21/7/18,61468930,Enrico,"If you have the chance, you don’t want to pass up staying with Doti in the perfect location in NYC! My wife and I stayed in her guest bedroom, which looked exactly like the pictures. The bed was comfy, the room was clean, and Doti’s breakfast was wonderful. I had just arrived after being out of town for a conference and Doti was able to do my laundry for me. Her apartment is 2 blocks from the subway and perfect for getting anywhere around town. There are plenty of restaurants near by and great nightlife in the Chelsea area. We highly recommend staying with Doti and will definitely stay here next time we’re in NYC. Thanks Doti for being a superb host!"
7322,294790091,22/7/18,22002442,Meghan,"Doti was a great host!! I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a welcoming place to stay in a great, central location. "
7322,295499665,23/7/18,4525300,Damon,Doti went out of her way to make our stay with a little one easy and special. Given the small space she has to work with everything we wanted and more was provided. Thanks Doti!
7322,295897111,24/7/18,22455716,Langston,Delightful and thoughtful couple. Nice bed and bath. An inexpensive place to stay in Chelsea.

7322,298562338,29/7/18,48185171,Patrick,"Doti was an exceptionally wonderful host. She went to extra lengths to make sure we felt welcome and comfortable in her house. She even ordered delicious NY bagels for us one morning for breakfast. We loved getting to meet Doti and will 100% look to stay in her home again on our next visit to NYC.

The apartment is wonderfully located in Chelsea. Everything we wanted to visit was easily reachable by walking or the metro. The sleeping and living space was very comfortable. The bed was very nice. Towels and soaps were provided for us. Every want and need we had was filled. I would highly recommend Doti's home to future visitors."
7322,300233805,1/8/18,2704910,Greg,"We were only there one night, arriving a bit late, but we were warmly welcomed and made to feel comfortable and at home in a very genuine way. Our large bedroom, and the bathroom (and the whole apartment), were very clean and well organized, with many interesting books everywhere we looked. A variety of fresh and tasty breakfast choices were offered (Doti is one of the rare hosts that really understands the second ""b"" of Airbnb), and our check-out day needs were graciously accommodated. The location is excellent, very convenient to downtown, midtown and uptown, and the neighborhood has plenty of local interest in itself. And all of this at a very affordable rate. I can't recommend Doti's place highly enough."

The room is immaculate as was the bathroom. Doti and her husband were attentive to our needs, friendly and made us feel very comfortable.  We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in New York City and hope to stay there again at some point.  Thank you, Doti, for helping to make our stay so special."

He welcomed us by the door when we arrived and gave us a lot of tips about how to visit New York. He prepared lovely breakfast and borrowed umbrella to us when raining. It’s just felt like home. 
The bedroom is bigger than I thought and the bed is comfortable. I will definitely choose here if I come back to New York in the future!"

Parking wasn’t too bad on the nearby streets either. 

"
7726,301683829,4/8/18,63414260,Aoife,"This is a very cute little apartment close to the Nostrand stop on the blue line. The apartment is very spacious for a 1 bed and was perfect for my husband and I and our 11 month old baby. Adam and Charity kindly supplied us with a crib for the baby. The neighborhood is full of beautiful brownstones and Nostrand ave has a couple of small grocery stores just 5 minutes walk away. We didn’t explore the neighborhood much as we headed to the waterfront each day. It’s just a short ride on the subway to downtown Brooklyn and amazing views of Manhattan. We recommend Brooklyn Bridge Park, part of which had just opened when we visited so we pretty much had the entire park to ourselves. "
7726,303998115,8/8/18,205559034,Sonja,very nice basement apartment with lots of space and light! Great host! nice neighborhood!
7726,307068445,13/8/18,70797280,Emily,"I'm so happy we chose this Airbnb.  Adam and Charity are wonderful hosts.  
 Communication before and during the visit was quick, kind and always helpful.  The place is so lovely and spacious, and the decor and art are really terrific.  The bedroom is enormous!  The location is an easy walk to great bars, restaurants, and subway stations.   I will recommend this Airbnb to my friends and family in the future!"
7726,309649634,18/8/18,6313095,Maria,We had a terrific stay in Brooklyn! The apartment is thoughtfully decorated and had everything we could need and more. Adam was easy to get in touch with for any questions we had and gave us some great restaurant recommendations. It was a hot couple of days when we visited and the A/C units were a godsend after walking around all day. The subway was a quick walk for our trips into Manhattan and the neighborhood felt safe and had plenty of options for dining and groceries. Highly recommend this Airbnb!
7726,312984692,24/8/18,5447799,Darla,"I spent a week at Adam and Charitys place and it was quite lovely, thoughtfully decorated and really comfortable - the perfect first stop on my NYC tour. The bedroom is gorgeous and the bed comfortable. The kitchen was really useful and has everything you could possibly need to cook a meal. The backyard was stupendous with seating and a lush grassy yard. I had a couple of friends over for a dinner party and it was perfect. The location is in a beautiful part of Crown Heights, with close proximity to the express train to Manhattan. I would most certainly stay here again!"
7801,7026,9/8/09,26220,Chi,"We stayed at Chaya's place for a week with our 2 kids. We had a wonderful time there, it was such a relief to have all that beautiful open space to come home to after an activity filled day in New York. The loft has a really peaceful feel to it, and it is surprisingly quiet during the night even though it is just around the corner from Bedford street. We loved the sauna, makes me wish we had one at home too... 
The apartment is well located, just a block or two from the L train, so getting to and from Manhattan is a breeze. "
7801,8317,26/8/09,29070,Joshua & Gugulethu,This loft was incredible.  I last lived in NYC in a Soho sublet and Chaya's loft easily surpasses even that experience.  The kitchen had everything we needed.  The bed was wonderfully restful and the shag rug by the wall-sized projection system had memory foam underneath.  Not to mention the sauna.  And all this for less than what we were prepared to pay for the Hotel Chelsea.  My friends were blown away.  We hope our next vacation to NYC corresponds to one of Chaya's vacations. 
7801,8591,30/8/09,31599,Opal,Simply AWESOME! We felt right at home at Chaya's loft.  It was clean and beautiful.  All the comforts of home. Maybe too comfortable.  We didn't want to leave! The location was perfect. WAY better than staying in a hotel room.  Worth every dime and then some. 
7801,87811,31/8/10,173750,Sandra,
7801,95077,12/9/10,71624,Petina,"Beautiful loft. The best place I've stayed in NYC. Hands Down! So many cool touches to the place. The kitchen is great and we had several dinners here. The rug is super comfy! The place was super clean.
The loft is very close to the subway (1 stop from Manhattan). Bedford ave is full of interesting shops, bars and nightlife. nearby I recommend the following:

shopping- Williamsburg flea market on saturdays, Bird, Meg

eating out: Diner, Marlow and Sons, Bozu, Walter's, Five Leaf, Fette Sau, Saltie, Egg, Pies n Thighs

bars: Union Pool , Hotel Delmano, Brooklyn Bowl

I would definitely recommend this place to friends and stay here again."
7801,164512,3/1/11,322540,Brent,"Nice place, and although I didn't meet Chaya, talked to her on the phone and we worked everything out great."
7801,342116,29/6/11,439195,Molly,"Chaya's loft was in a perfect position for exploring both Brooklyn and Manhattan. We were slightly disappointed with the level of cleanliness when we arrived (we couldn't tell if the bed had fresh sheets or not, for instance), but that said, we had a comfortable and enjoyable stay over all.  

Chaya gave us some good tips for the area. We ended up trying Best Pizza (on a night we had to stay in and wait for a lost bag to be delivered by an airline) and it was great. I can also highly recommend Diner for brunch! "
7801,488222,30/8/11,703349,Les,"The photos don't do Chaya's place justice!  Without exaggerating, we couldn't believe our eyes when we first walked in.  It was huge, a very cool layout, and beautiful.  They have their own sauna!  Is this normal in Brooklyn?  We had 3 people in our party and visited at the end of august for 4 days/nights.  Hurricane Irene had caused nyc to shut down the mta and it looked likely we were going to spend 2 of the 4 days stuck inside.  Despite this, we were very thankful to have such a comfortable space that felt like home.  It was a very special trip and this space had a lot to do with that.  Thank you, Chaya!  Your place would be my number one choice to stay in NY!"
7801,512801,8/9/11,244926,Ross,"Chaya's apartment  is amazing and even nicer than it looks in the photos.  The location was perfect for exploring Brooklyn and so close to the subway that you can be in Manhattan in no time at all. We also stayed in a nice hotel in SoHo on our trip but it didn't even compare to how good Chaya's place is, we would recommend it to everyone. Thank you."
7801,809746,28/12/11,768779,Betsy,"We loved Chaya's apartment.  It is very well appointed including the kitchen which had everything I needed to cook up a storm.  The bed is so comfortable that it rivals my own at home.  We really loved the projector and watching football and movies on the huge wall.  The neighbors are very quiet, and the neighborhood is great and so quiet despite being just feet off of a main street. It is a perfect place to hang out even though getting away is easy with  the subway only two blocks away We are definitely planning on staying here again"
7970,8077,23/8/09,25560,Susan,"This place is very very old but is kept very clean by the building manager. The air-con works intermittently, so the upper loft section gets very hot and unbearable to sleep in. If you don't mind old, then this place provides all the basics: a comfy bed, a shower, a fridge and a stove."
7970,10951,21/9/09,34154,Bonnie And Ryan,"My parents actually stayed in this place and absolutly loved it, the location was perfect for them and the apartment was really clean and comfy. 
I'm sure they would recommend this place to anyone, especially an older couple like themselves who want to be in the thick of all the action for an action packed stay in the big apple. I would also like to thank Cee for letting me book the place for my parents. Cheers!"
7970,16252,4/11/09,49693,Kevin,"This place is old but comfortable, I believe it would need a deep cleaning.  The only problem we had was the noise from the people above, seems like they never sleep.
Having an elevator for 4th floor is a perk."
7970,18039,22/11/09,54592,Andrea,I never saw cee but the super was really friendly. The room was old but very clean. Good neighborhood and close to many things and a short subway ride to others. We had four people with us so the price was good. 
7970,33106,4/4/10,56283,Anjali,"I stayed there for a 2 night stay with 4 other friends (we were 5 adults total) and it was big enough. It is an old appartement that's for sure but it is very well located!!!! You can walk to Union square, Macy's, times square etc... The 2 double beds were comfy but the sofa was terrible as per my friend...I also believe that it would need a deep cleaning. I would suggest that people brings their own towels and sheets in order to avoid (Website hidden by Airbnb) conclude I would say that for the price we paid, it is worth it!"
7970,39208,1/5/10,112120,Christina,"Good price for a cute rental. I stayed for 4 nights. 
It is an older rental, however most of the apartments in New York are. I was happy with it. 
I was easily able to reach Cee when I needed her, which was nice. 
I was happy to have a small kitchen with a fridge and microwave for leftovers.
Very nice neighborhood. Easy walk to attractions.
Overall, I was very happy with everything."
7970,58532,28/6/10,85711,Christopher,"Cee was very helpful and responsive leading up to and during the trip.  The location is ideal for walking around the city and seeing all the sites and destination locations.  The place is pretty much exactly as pictured--its not a brand new place--but it has city charm and we had everything we could need right there in the apartment for a visit to NYC.  Excellent visit and a great place to stay for several people!  We had 3, but easily sleeps 4, and upwards of 6 if pressed.  Would gladly stay here again!"
7970,279919,24/5/11,600077,Jay,"The apartment was great. Good location and easy to find. The super was a bit clueless and slow, but it didn't bother me. The cleaning guy was real nice. The place was supposed to be ready at 3pm and we had to wait until 4pm. That's the only complaint. It appeared as if noone actually lives there. "
7970,298154,5/6/11,496090,Mary Jane,This is a well-located apartment in Chelsea with plenty of space for my adult daughter and (Website hidden by Airbnb) was clean and comfortable - kind of basic but fine.  
7970,337339,27/6/11,599445,Olivier,"It was a great experience of N.Y.C staying in this apartment. It is well located. You can go to most of the places to be seen by foot in N.Y.C. The team who manages the building is really fun with a real N.Y.C accent. We were proposed to let our luggages in their office in the basement for the last day so that we could enjoy few more hours the city. Size of the appartment is Ok for three people, you do not feel like a rabbit in his cage ;). Conclusion : good place even if building a bit old."
7970,434905,10/8/11,822087,Alessandra,"Perfect solution to live and visit New York, very near to everything (the Flatiron building really behind the corner, and the delicious hamburgers of Shake Shak too!), metro and bus just a few minutes. The house was very clean, confortable, nice, spacious. We were 3 and we staied very very well! Out of the window you can see the Empire State Building! :) I really reccomend this solution!"
7970,732249,20/11/11,1098816,Soledad,"Cee apartment is great! Really comfortable and great location!

 "
7970,794334,19/12/11,1486617,Eleanor,"Cee's place was as advertised - well-located, basic -- and fit our needs. The bed was uncomfortable, the lighting was dim, and the apartment could use a deep clean. If you have back problems or are looking for a nice spot to hang out, look elsewhere. But if you want a reasonable, convenient crash pad for up to 5 people, this is your place. Cee was responsive to questions via email, and though she was not around, the super let us in with no problems. Bring earplugs for street noise. "
7970,1005183,17/3/12,1418052,Jess,"Perfect location. Right in the centre of everything. You really can see the Empire State Building from the window & at he weekend there is a great flea market across the street.

We really enjoyed our stay and would definately return."
7970,1311663,20/5/12,2335423,Patty,"We stayed in two places during our long weekend in NY. This place was the better of the two - even if the other one was technically ""nicer."" This place is bigger than the pictures imply, and the big bed, which isn't shown in these pics, was very comfy. Cee was very nice and responded quickly when there was a little snafu with the keys. The price is great. I'd definitely stay here again before I'd ever stay in a hotel or another apartment on this site. "
7970,2581243,11/10/12,3504600,Dominic,"This is an amazing, central location to all you would want to see in Manhattan!  One block from beautiful Madison Square Park, lots of activity, a 2-minute walk to the N,Q,R subway, 15-minute walk to Times Square, and Eataly is right nearby (get your morning latte there every day!).  The building management is really nice and helpful and when the sink in the bathroom had a leak, they were right on top of getting it fixed.  Cee was quick to respond to everything and answered whatever questions we had before we arrived.  It's an old building so some water temp changes and squeaky floors are to be expected.  The apartment could use a bit of an update (some of the furniture feels well-worn, the ""loft"" is more of a crawl space, and the kitchen doesn't really inspire use) but you should be out exploring anyway so for the price it's totally worth it.  By no means is this to say it's a dump...just don't expect the Ritz.  This place is more ideal for explorers rather than those looking for a romantic getaway.  It's a great spot, comfortable enough, and in a very safe area...with very nice people attached (Cee and the management)."
7970,2728847,27/10/12,3407428,Stéphane,Location was just perfect! Very close to Broadway and 5th Avenue. Flat is a bit old and could be cleaner. It was big enough for all 3 of us. Very quiet at night which was a good surprise!
7970,3087106,14/12/12,2544057,Diana,"Great location for business or vacations to NYC. The apartment is close to food, a 24hr convenience store, subway stops, etc. Have stayed in this building before and would stay here again. "
7970,3541202,14/2/13,4805632,Nacho,"Aunque no conocimos a Cee, los encargados del edificio nos atendieron perfectamente. La localización del apartamento es magnífica, a un paseo de Times Square, en un barrio espléndido, donde hay un montón de lugares con música en vivo (en la 26), supermercados, etc. La única pega seria es la conexión a internet, que es sólo por cable y no pudimos conectar los móviles por wifi, pero es tal y como aparece en las fotos, con vistas al Empire State desde la cama. De todas formas, es un apartamento muy recomendable."
7970,3953521,30/3/13,61128,Veronica,"Great Location to everything.  Keys were there and delivered by the super.  My only thing was that it did need a little updating.  Coffee maker was probably from the 1970 and still had used coffee grind from, i guess, the previous renter. :( if we are paying for cleaning fees, than i would expect everything cleaned.. sorry..
But the location was great.  "
7970,4163052,15/4/13,5213104,Paul,"Thanks Cee for letting us stay in your apartment last week We stayed for five nights and the location was great. The apartment was clean, supplied well with plenty of towels for the four of us and the Super was easy to work with. 
"
7970,4428026,5/5/13,1701371,Laura,Super séjour dans cet appartement bien situé à deux pas du Madison Square Park. La rue est calme et la vue donne sur l'Empire. Bien équipé. 
7970,5018270,8/6/13,2032385,Nadine,"The location of the apartment is perfect ! There are more than enough subway stations in the area. The apartment itself is cozy and nice. Although it could use some renovation here and there,  it was clean  and we felt at home. You can hear the elevator but that's only the first night, then you get used to the sound. Clean Towels and linen were  provided. The super is very nice and helps right away if he's needed! We left our bags in the basement and could fully enjoy the last day in Manhattan. (The view of the Empire State Building right outside the window every morning and every night wasn't bad either )  We'd like to come back and we recommend Cee's place to friends and family!"
7970,6852399,27/8/13,8173305,Martina,The reservation was canceled 121 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7970,7162599,9/9/13,4109169,Yvonne,"Great location indeed! This apartment is just as it says in the write-up and comments made.  It is a great experience of true NYC.  I would just advise if you are sensitive to mattresses (a.k.a. back/neck issues), the mattress is old and lumpy and not supportive and the pillows are awful.  If you were to bring your own pillow, you may be better off.  I agree with the other reviews that an uplift may be in order....but if you just want an easy place to stay that is super convenient, this is the place for you!"
7970,7708890,30/9/13,4925156,Yury,Very good location! Nice place in the heart of the city. We had a good time at this comfortable flat.
7970,8308587,25/10/13,7687446,Julie,"After spending ten nights in this apartment I guess it grew on us ..we did have a few problems which included .The wifi dropping out constantly ..which was our main source of communication with family and friends ...the appliances where very old or non existence (hope the new toaster we brought stays for other guests) ..the toilet was a big problem overflowing and running constantly after talking with Winston who was always on hand to fix it for us ..it was a issue in the rest of the building 
I tried to contact Cee and got her sister instead who was happy to send her father around to fix things if Winston couldn't ... The bedding could be upgraded putting two flat pillows inside one case not my idea of comfort. However you can't beat the location and if you want to experience a real old New York appartment then give it a go ..after all it's the experience that makes a holiday for me ...
Cee take note of all the other reviews about the cleanliness and comfort of your guests and this would be a great place to stay...probably only cost you one nights rent .. I would just like to thank Winston for all his help we found him very friendly and helpful 
Cheers the girls from OZ "

"
7970,13757945,3/6/14,2237099,Charis,"Starting off with the positives. The location is perfect, the house is big enough for three people and clean, and the host and live-in super were friendly and helpful. The house is however kind of old. 

On our last night we had accidentally left a bag with some unfinished food next to the trashcan and unfortunately we found 2 mice in the kitchen area that night. That was partly our fault but we think it is something we should mention. "
7970,27139607,26/2/15,5313420,Pauline,"The appartment has an ideal location in NY, very central if you want to visit most of the neighbourhoods of the city.
But i must say we were expecting a much cleaner appartment especially because of the important cleaning fees we had to pay. The floor needed vacuming, the dishes were a bit sticky and the overall atmosphere did not appear very clean. 
Some people might also be disturbed by the noise. (Upstairs neighbor and lift) 
We did not get the opportunity to meet the host but the super was welcoming and let us in when we arrived and also offered to keep our bags on our last day so that we could enjoy the city."
7970,27369930,2/3/15,27124787,Joshua,Everything was great. Really enjoyed the location. The apartment was clean and comfortable.
7970,130324278,5/2/17,78894476,William,"Chic Chelsea was an amazing spot. I absolutely loved the central location of the building - only being a block or two away from Q, 6, D, F and more! I also loved the burnt down chruch across the street. The Antique fairs during the weekend were a great morning activity. Cee was really helpful with the stay. Her and Winston made sure we had everything we needed! "
7970,205627497,22/10/17,2689084,Fernando,Great Apartment. And great hospitality
7970,215565138,30/11/17,23528799,Alexander,"Cee's place is extremely conveniently located within midtown, just next to Madison Sq Park and the Flatiron Building.
The apartment is cosy - if not a little Spartan - and was very clean throughout, with windows looking onto the street, and out over the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Sava.
The road can be a little noisy at night, so it's worth keeping the windows and curtains well shut.
Overall, Cee's place offers exceptional value."
7970,305688400,11/8/18,159004272,Bron,Great location! Cee was very helpful and responsive to any questions we had. 
8024,12609,5/10/09,42661,Cory,This was quite possibly the best place anyone could ask for.  The hosts were amazing and so helpful.  I don't think I've slept better in any other room in the country.  Thank you so much!

8024,27706,27/2/10,66682,Dimitri,"We stayed for 12 days at CBG and it was like a second home for us. The place is close from everything (subway) in a really nice neighbourood.We loved walking arouns in park Slope and the 5th Av is full of nice little shops.
Lisel and Seija were great ! We had breakfast at home and sometimes diner when the day was exhausting !
More over, we had our flight back cancelled in the middle of the night because of the snow, it was 4AM and we knew we could come back in the middle of the night at Cbg.
Like your home away from home I told you !"
8024,42868,16/5/10,34986,Ann-Michele,"We had an fine long weekend experience at Cbg in Park Slope. Our bedroom was downstairs bedroom right off an entry way which really suited our needs. Our bed was very comfortable and the ceiling fan was a lovely addition. The downstairs bathroom was just down the hall near the kitchen and garden. And -- what a  wonderful garden!!The area is perfect for anyone intersted in small shops, good coffee and easy access to the subway.  On Saturday night, we used the seating area right off the kitchen to chat with friends while another guest cooked a late dinner. It all worked. This is an easy, welcoming home.Lisel was a delight and we intend to come back in a few months. "
8024,58318,28/6/10,116631,Jean-Philippe,"Bonjour à tous, si vous cherchez une ambiance paisible dans un endroit très accueillant par son hôte Lisel, dans sa belle maison au décor bohème dans un quartier tranquille, vous serez servi. La cuisine est équipé pour les repas, un frigo est à la disposition des invités, les chambres sont confortables et climatisées, deux hamacs sont installés à la cour pour les fins de soirée, à 15-20 minutes de Manhattan en métro et en ligne direct, qui est à 5 minutes de marche et à 20-25 minutes de l'aquarium de New York (un incontournable)et la plage de Coney Island et ses parcs d'attractions. Nous étions un groupe de 11 personnes, adultes et enfants et avons vraiment apprécié notre rencontre avec Lisel, nous avons trouvé notre endroit pour séjourné à NYC à l'avenir. JP"
8024,63206,10/7/10,158230,Mark,"We recently spent a week at the Cbg Guest house in Brooklyn.  A wonderful experience for a family -- 3 kids under 11 -- with Lisel as an attentive and gracious hostess.  The neighborhood is great with lots going on, good food choices and a nice coffee shop on the corner to get you going in the morning.  Getting around all of NYC is really easy as well with subway access within a 10 minute walk. The room and beds were great and it was really nice to have access to a full kitchen.  I highly  recommend the Cbg Guest house for people wanting to have access to NYC from a neighborhood base.  We will be coming back."
8024,88225,1/9/10,164917,Christina,My stay at Lisel's lovely guest house has been the perfect transition home away from home that I needed.  She has decorated her house so that you want to take a seat and stay for awhile.  I have met some incredible house guests and we've taken to going out on the town or cooking dinner together.  You will be pleasantly pleased by all that is offered. CV
8024,102127,21/9/10,164016,Mike,What a lovely stay. Both Linda and I felt at home and we were. I would recommend at stay at Lisel's home.  
8024,119881,15/10/10,249615,Jayanthilal,The host canceled my reservation 14 days before arrival.
8024,123829,21/10/10,240897,Sandra,"Lisel's place is very comfortable and quiet. My husband, my mother, my 18 month old and I were quite happy to stay there. Even though the rooms we were in were not entirely private, it was always very quiet. And our fellow guests were a nice mix of people, and all very courteous. "
8024,126647,25/10/10,248013,Lauren,"My husband and I really enjoyed our short stay here. The house is filled with books and artsy clutter. Lisel and Seija are friendly and very pleasant hosts. We also ate breakfast at Seija's vegan restaurant, Sun in Bloom. Delicious.

Lisel is generous and welcoming. The house is clean, the bed in the first floor front bedroom very comfortable. We had a very quiet night, with the exception of a car alarm. The bathroom situation is quirky, with a shower just off the living room and the teensiest powder room in the world, but it just takes a little flexibility and good humor to adjust.

Great, quiet but fun Park Slope neighborhood--a bookbinder a couple doors away, coffee shop, all sorts of restaurants around the corner on Fifth. We had a Colombian lunch at Bogota and a wonderful supper at Alchemy. It's just a few short blocks to the Bergen St. subway station. Be advised there are two Bergen St. stations! 

"
8024,139254,15/11/10,102951,Lori,"Clean friendly cozy and very convenient. Not fancy, but very homey.  Lisel the owner does serious community work for Haiti relief. Large  shared kitchen. Like staying in someone's home, which it is. Perfect for visiting family for a few days. Lisel is very gracious and conscientious and fixed room mix- up immediately. Large stone shower. I'd stay here again for sure. Thanks!"
8024,146982,30/11/10,210616,Peggy,A wonderful experience.  Lisel couldn't have been more gracious and welcoming.  The bed was super comfortable and the location was perfect.  
8024,154742,16/12/10,295664,Noelle,My friend & I stayed in the CBJ Guest House for 5 days last week. Lisel was very welcoming and helpful with places to see in the area. The room was extremely comfortable. Great location as well!!! Great access to the subway & awesome restaurants all within walking distance. I highly recommend staying here to future guests. 
8024,164548,3/1/11,307240,Han,"We got the main bedroom on the third floor. The room is amazingly colorful and lovely. I fell in love with the blue color and the paintings on the walls by local artists. She is an artist!!! 
And as we asked, there was a IKEA daybed set up for my friend. We got clean bed clothes and even clean towers!!! It was very cozy 4 days staying in the house. 
The subway is within 5 mins walking distance. So it's actually a good place to stay for visiting NYC but wanting to avoid the crowds in Manhattan. 
There's some lovely little restaurants around. And you can get bagel and coffee very early in the morning with a little walk less than 3 mins!!! 
Anyway, I'll definitely recommend this house to my friends."
8024,172285,18/1/11,335150,Amber,"I reached out to CBG with a unique request. I was looking to host a cooking party with 15 of my closest friends hosted by a personal chef. I live in the city but my apartment really isn't conducive to that type of experience. I planned to host at a friend's place but something came up and they canceled on me 3 days before I was supposed to have the event. Another friend referred me to this site and I came across CBG. After pitching my unique request, Lisel got back to me immediately and said she'd be happy to have me. She made everything very convenient for me & my guests and there were no issues getting what was needed - it was overall a wonderful exchange. The only drawback (& why I'm giving 4 stars vs. 5) is the kitchen is a little cluttered. Granted there were a few of us packed in but you can tell the house has been occupied for a while. Overall, it was a great experience. I'd recommend CBG to anyone in the future."
8024,231565,19/4/11,410973,Alessandro,"Good atmosphere and host very kind. Very good location, in 30min you are in the center.
Thank you very much!"
8024,249484,3/5/11,385209,Danny,Our time at Lisel's guest house was amazing!  We were in town for a conference and she was very accomodating for our large group.  Half of our group needed to stay another night and Lisel was very helpful in switching some things around to make it work for us.  The location was amazing and was very close to everything Park Slope had to offer.  The home was clean yet comfy and had a full kitchen for our use.  Our group of 9 had plenty of hot water for showers and we were able to come and go as we please.  We were treated like family and will definitely be back next time we're in Brooklyn!
8024,257491,9/5/11,552098,Katrina,"Great host, super accommodating. Booked for a business stay and was totally pleased. 

"
8024,276369,23/5/11,509795,Carol,"It's difficult to describe the Community Be Good Guesthouse because it is a very different experience than many of us are used to, especially when traveling in New York City.  It's more like staying with a friend you've never met before than staying in a B & B.  I looked all over the Park Slope area for a place for my Mom, husband and I to stay near where my daughter lives for her college graduation.  Finding a single room for three people in NYC is nearly impossible (and extremely expensive to take two rooms).  The traditional B & B's in Park Slope all had terrible reviews for friendliness and helpfulness - in fact they all seemed obnoxious, which was borne out when I called one of them.  Then I discovered Airbnb and the CBG Guesthouse.  From the first contact, Lesal was friendly, direct, helpful, accommodating.  If you need luxury, this is not the place to stay, but if you want to feel like family and talk with an engaging, intelligent, thoughtful and wise woman and be in a wonderful area at a really reasonable price, this is a gem!  Although it requires suspending the ""hotel"" mentality, we all (including my 82 year old mother) thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would stay there again in an instant (despite the ""smallest bathroom in the world"" and shower in the office space).   Thanks to Lesal and Cecilio and all who make this wonderful space possible!"
8024,285668,28/5/11,536866,Ryan,"I had a very comfortable stay here at the guest house. Great hospitality, great home and a very quick response on short notice. The area is also a big plus located in downtown area."
8024,349516,3/7/11,596908,Judy,"This is a wonderful house on a tree lined street in Brooklyn close to subways, and lots of great restaurants, shops and coffee houses.  It is clean and comfortable with a beautiful back garden and a full kitchen that guests may use.  The host is friendly but not overbearing.  I highly recommend it."
8024,371099,13/7/11,731585,Fenella,"Lisel was such a warm and inviting hostess. My friends drove me down to Brooklyn to help me find a place to live, and Lisel was incredibly insightful and quick to share advice and contacts with us. The house provided all of the necessary amenities like wifi, a clean, shared, bathroom and kitchen. It's close to several great cafes, restaurants and grocery stores. I would certainly recommend this Guest Home to young travellers, and those who enjoy a space that harbors community and connection. 
Thanks, Lisel! "
8024,399135,26/7/11,191466,Ken,"Lisle was fantastic. Very helpful and accommodating. The other guests were quiet and respectful. I have used AirBnb and stayed in Guest Houses before and this house was unique in my experience. Although the house has a 'wild' and eclectic feel with a tremendous number of books and art objects there was also a very strong sense of order and cleanliness.

We travel to NYC 3-5 times a year and have friends in the neighborhood and are hoping that we will have the opportunity to stay again.  "
8024,406838,30/7/11,200616,Sandra,"Our stay at Lisel's was great.  I needed to add a room at the last minute. She was so accommodating. My family really enjoyed her home. It is very different from what they're accustomed to. For me, I found there is so much information in the host and the home. If you're an avid reader, you will find much joy in the abundance of literature there. This is a great place for family and good friends to stay. I would definitely stay there again.
Another good note, Lisel is very passionate in her service to community both near and far. I enjoy people who are unselfish in their plight to serve those that are less fortunate."
8024,428535,8/8/11,773897,Angelique,"Cozy and charming, the community be good guesthouse was everything we could have wanted in a home away from home for our 3 day stay.  Lisel and friends were incredibly accommodating, the place was clean and cheery and the neighborhood was fantastic.   "
8024,446553,15/8/11,822397,Daniel,We had a wonderful stay in this cozy house. The neighborhood is great with easy access to multiple subway lines. And the host was very friendly.

The people living at the guest house are very open and friendly.

There were two things they were not convenient. From our room (we had room #2) was only a thin wall with a window to the neighbour room. When our neighbour came late at night we heard him and our room was light as at daytime ... 
There are also only three bathrooms for all the guest rooms an the people living there. This is may be a little too less."
8024,634700,16/10/11,58537,Ceren,"We stayed two nights at the cbg guesthouse, everything was perfect, we will definetly stay there the next time we visit New York."
8024,635787,17/10/11,269649,Alexis,"Such a warm, wonderful place to stay, in a fabulous location! We all ate well, slept well, and made some new friends! I'll definitely stay again."
8024,651918,22/10/11,1119971,Kathryn,"Aside from being a cozy, comfortable accommodation, located in a wonderful and lively neighborhood, Cbg Guest House provided myself, my husband and our two teenagers with a great place to meet up with other like minded folks. We came to the area to investigate possible universities for the young men.  Lisel was a wonderful resource.  She not only shared her knowledge of the area, but she also shared her life experiences and even a book!!! When leaving, we felt as if we'd found a home away from home. It also felt good to know that some of the money paid went to help re-build Haiti. So much better that a corporate hotel!!!!!!"
8024,699547,7/11/11,1102783,Jenifer,Starting to feel like a home away from home at Lisel's - thank you so much for having us again!
8024,1070714,2/4/12,89193,Susan,I came with a Mother/Daughter group of 5 moms and 5 teenage daughters.  It was a great place for us to stay- relaxed and homey.  We really appreciated  cooking our meals in the kitchen and gathering to chat in the dining room.  The location of comtybegood is fantastic.  It's only a few blocks to the subway and only a block or two to shopping and restaurants.  Lisel was very welcoming and friendly.  We would love to come back and stay here in the future.  
8024,1268863,12/5/12,2297201,Guillermo,"Excellent place, friendly hosts and nice house with great location!"
8024,1458956,11/6/12,275486,Carol,"We had a wonderful stay at Community Be Good.  Our room was large, clean and comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet and pleasant. There was a large variety of restaurants within easy walking distance. We also walked to the beautiful Prospect Park (the Brooklyn Botanic Garden was wonderful!) and over to the Brooklyn Academy of Music for a film.  It was easy to access the subway to Manhattan, too.  Though we go to NYC fairly often, it was our first stay over in Park Slope and we plan to do it again!"
8024,3273157,5/1/13,2359781,Christine,Lisel was a very friendly Host. We loved the neighborhood and all the very good inexpensive restaurants very close to the house. We were two families with 7 children and everyone felt like he was at home !
8024,3687843,4/3/13,2305077,Arnold,My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed staying at CBG guest house. It was cozy and located only 5 minutes away from the Barclay's center. We were there for only one night but had a great sleep. I would definitely recommend staying here!
8024,4089381,8/4/13,1568913,Ramon,"Great place. Calm and nice. Location is convenient. Lisel is easy to talk to and communicates well.

 I'll stay there again when in NYC. "
8024,4889410,31/5/13,4895728,Marc,"Just spent 5 days @ CBG in Brooklyn with family & friends (we were 8 in total).  CBG is a super place in a great location.

Lisel was a super host and setup comfortable rooms for all of us. The accommodations were great.  CBG is a charming house & a readers paradise - I have never seen that many books in 1 house.

We also loved the neighborhood; many coffee shops & restaurants and only a short walk to the metro to Manhatten.  We even walked across the Brooklyn bridge into Manhatten.  

I recommend CBG without reservation !"
8024,5668728,10/7/13,6221475,Alice,"Lisel is a friendly person, her house has big rooms with a lovely garden. It is close to the metro. A great coffee shop is just around the corner with fresh brioches and muffins. Thanks Lisl."

8024,6314642,7/8/13,7296214,Tom,"We were happy to have a place to stay in the brownstone house with the great location - coffee shop a few steps away - close proximity to the subway lines - and revitalized, hip neighborhood. The house is architecturally interesting with lots of ornamental detail in the house and well-proportioned rooms with high ceilings.

Our host Dupree was very friendly and accommodating. We are a family of five, man and wife with 3 children and were offered 2 rooms for our stay with access to a large kitchen, bathroom, and garden terrace out back. "
8024,7403640,18/9/13,8672091,Namie,"I and my friend stayed at her house for 7 days. We enjoyed very much!  Lisel is very nice, kind and reliable person.
The room was so quiet that we could sleep well. We could get access to a big subway station to go to Manhattan so easily.
A couple of bathrooms are equipped and it was so convenient.
Thank you! 
"
8024,7552597,24/9/13,7939807,John,"Enjoyed the stay.  Took a while to get used to the routine because we had never stayed in this kind of accommodations before.  Overall, it was a good experience."
8024,7614480,26/9/13,8853887,Gabrielle,"Une maison dans Brooklyn, bien située, très agréable et propre, joliment aménagée et décorée. Le jardin aux beaux jours est parfait pour un petit déjeuner au soleil. Hôtes accueillants, et riches d'échange et de partage ! Je conseille à tous !
Je suis venue avec une amie et mon fils de 2 ans."
8024,8015763,13/10/13,941907,Vigdis,"For our group of four adult couples, this accomodation was a good choice. We enjoyed both the noise and excitement of the big City and Park Slope with all its quirky little shops and restaurants. The weather was great, and we were lucky to stay at Liesl's and have access to her garden.
The beds were comfortable and the living was easy at Liesl's place. We are in awe of her ardent work for humanitarian causes, and the fact that one contributes to her projects by choosing her guesthouse makes the stay all the more pleasant.

8024,8135479,17/10/13,5928048,Ana Cristina,"Lisel is an excelent host, we had a great time, the house is realle close from the metro station which makes it easy to move in new york so we got to konw it pretty good. 

There were 10 of us in the house and didnt have a problem to sleep or anything.

Thank you so much Lisel for everything, whenever we go back to new york we will be there."
8024,8458589,1/11/13,7684196,Sylvie,"Nous avons passé un bon séjour chez Lisa très convivial, Pour une famille nombreuse le tarif est imbattable. La situation est facile proche du subway. "

8024,9464646,30/12/13,9647092,Catherine,"We really enjoyed our stay at Community be good. Lisel is a great host, friendly and knowledgeable. The location is very convenient with several train stations close by (5min walk) and the neighborhood is great, charming streets, very safe and with a lot of good restaurants and coffee places to go to. We were a large group of 10 adults and kids and the house was very convenient with plenty of rooms and bathrooms. "
8024,9700528,6/1/14,8105061,Ruben,"Mi estancia en la comunidad de Lisel fue esplendida.Ella es una gran anfitriona, siempre esta dispuesta a yudar en todo. La comunidad esta muy bien situada, cerca de una estacion de trenes que te llevan directamente a Manhattan. Me senti como en una gran familia y si alguna vez volvemos a Nueva York sin duda alguna volveremos a repetir  con ella."
8024,12021365,21/4/14,13814953,Mathilde,"My family and I had a very pleasant stay. The room was really comfortable, and everyone in the house was kind and welcoming !

The neigborhood is very calm and relaxing, and the location is great : The subway is just around the corner, there is also a great coffee shop down the street and a good mexican restaurant nearby !
"
8024,12485983,4/5/14,10902937,Catherine,"We were as if we were at home in Lisel's house... Feeling so good!!
The area is also very welcoming: quiet and safe streets with beautiful trees, some pubs and the supermarket 1 minute walk from Lisel's house.
We are in Brooklyn real life! 
Lisel's house is also very closed to Atlantic avenue subway station where most of Brooklyn trains stop. It's very convenient to go anywhere. 
This is also very closed to Barclay's center hosting Brooklyn Nets NBA games (great in case you are fond of Basket-ball).
Well, we will be very happy to visit Lisel back when our boys will be old enough to  visit such an amazing city.
Thanks a lot for this wonderful week in NYC!"
8024,14797832,26/6/14,16189026,Timothy,"Friendly, fun and great location. Kids had a good time too. "
8024,16049746,20/7/14,7498575,Ale,"Lisel was absolutely wonderful. I contacted her with a very last minute request and she was nothing more than extremely helpful. We were lucky to find such a great host and the rest of the people staying at the place were great as well. The neighborhood is really nice, there are tons of restaurants and bars around.

I'll definitely keep this place in mind for future visits!"
8024,18332148,25/8/14,18735734,Krystian,"The neighborhood was very pleasant, easy to access cafes,  bars and various shops and stores on foot, plus there's a little mall and a few subway stations nearby. The area is also very green and quiet. 
The host was nice and accommodating. The apartment will be awesome for voracious readers, basically every wall is full of books. The facilities are all in working order. The place was clean though a little cluttered, which I personally like. One negative point or maybe a tip for future travelers - if you're a tall person, and you're sleeping in the extra bed / cot, ask the host about its exact dimensions and decide accordingly - my body adopted by the second night ;) Because the place is big, you can usually expect a few travelers, so that gives you a sort of privacy through numbers, which is also something a lot of people would like. If you want to socialize with the host or boarders, there are common areas with usually some interesting people to talk to. "
8024,19117653,7/9/14,5282793,Rachel,Lisel was very welcoming and flexible in accommodating our large party (10).
8024,19474694,13/9/14,13729427,Gwenn,"I visited with my husband and teenage daughter.  We really enjoyed our stay here.   We were comfortable in the bedrooms and enjoyed the pretty colors, art, and books around the house.  We relaxed on the patio, and met other guests.   It was nice talking with the host, who does interesting things with her life.   Thanks for a nice haven in busy New York."
8024,19783018,18/9/14,14086350,Karin,"Lovely room in a beautifully decorated home, large enough for our group of three.  A pleasant location with shops and restaurants nearby. Would be pleased to come back. "

The house is really cool and the room is super convenient and private because it is right as you enter the front hallway.
We had 2 big comfortable beds.
There are all kinds of extra amenities in the kitchen - and a relaxing back porch.
It has a great location - 2 minutes from Gorilla Coffee and a 5 min. walk from the Barkley Center and the Metro!
I miss it already!"
8024,20881865,6/10/14,426261,Ada,"Do you remember those days when you were backpacking through Asia/Europe/South America etc and you stayed at a really cool hostel? This is what Lisel's place remember me off . Everyone was lovely. There are a lot of shared facilities (bathroom, kitchen etc) and you can come and go as you please. "
8024,24732259,2/1/15,12604381,Jaime,Lisel was really hospitable! We checked in a little late but she settled us down really quickly and showed us around her place :) the room looks exactly like the ones in the picture. The common kitchen is free for all to use!

8024,30887374,28/4/15,9665398,Naiara,"Lisel made us feel like home. She was very flexible with our schedule and very helpful. We had a room with two beds and we shared kitchen and bathroom. Bathroom was super clean and the kitchen had everything we needed for cooking. The backyard was great. The room was not exactly as in the pictures regarding furniture and the wall needs painting, everything looks much more worn and old. Anyway, it is in a nice neighborhood, with lots of restaurants and very close to multiple subway stations. "
8024,31342626,4/5/15,11495922,Egest,"If you like Brooklyn, if you like Haiti, if you care, if you like sharing, talking, connecting, cooking, chilling, please join this house in this great neighbourhood. Enjoy the sun in the backyard, have a chat with the activist-host on new forms of social economy, or on how to save the world vol.3, and then go sip some hip coffee on the swedish espresso bar nextdoor."
8024,32826697,22/5/15,12299536,Julien,"Nous étions 7, en famille et avons tous été enchantes de notre sejour chez Lisel.
Les chambres étaient propres et spacieuses. Nous avions quasiment la maison pour nous tout seuls car Lisel est très discrète. Quand elle était la, c'était un plaisir de discuter et d'échanger avec elle.
Le quartier autour de la maison est plein de magasins et de restaurants, très agréable et sécuritaire et il est possible de se rendre à peu près partout dans Manhattan sans changer de ligne de metro et de manière très rapide.
Un endroit idéal que nous recommandons à tous."
8024,33872838,1/6/15,22457727,Randa,"Lisel is a woman with a heart of Gold, she's generous, understanding and very compassionate about her cause. The house is so cosy, clean, efficient and in a lovely neighborhood, although I stayed there for only one night, but I absolutely loved it. The room that I shared with two other friends had TV, clean sheets and towels. Lisel showed us around, introduced us to other airbnb guests and welcomed us into her house with open arms. I would absolutely stay there again. "
8024,34373187,7/6/15,8370545,Pamela,"Location is great! The place was cozy , there's a cute little garden in the back. Lisel was such a great host, easy to contact and kind. "

8024,36104781,25/6/15,8661511,Jen And Bill,The brownstone is located on a great street in a wonderful location in Park Slope.  The house has a big communal kitchen and space and everyone was very friendly.
8024,36395779,28/6/15,8267279,Ashley,"we had a lovely stay at this house. the location was perfect for our needs. the neighborhood had so many things to offer in the way of food, drink, and eye candy. we very much appreciated the relaxed but clean atmosphere of the house - the eclectic decor, the comfy covered back patio, the ease of going and coming. 

i only have a couple of complaints. the room we ended up staying in is not in any of the pictures on the listing and was much more cramped, less brightly-lit, and with smaller beds than what is advertised. also, it was not completely clear from the description that all of the facilities are communal. from the images and the write up, we thought we'd have our own kitchen and bathroom. that being said, we did not mind the communal atmosphere at all! we just had a different expectation. i will say, however, that we were the only people staying in the house at the time (other than the few who live there, who were more than lovely but we only barely ran into). if the house were full of guests, the communal bathroom situation could have been a bit trickier.

Cozy small places to eat on 5th and a Gorilla coffeeshop just round the corner and supermarket Keyfood 100 meters away.
Very easy with subway and bus 63 to the new Brooklyn Height Promenade."

She awaited our arrival and provided a tour of the home upon check-in (don’t forget your $25 key deposit which is returned upon check-out). There is plenty of space in the backyard to relax and hammock when the weather is nice. You have access to the kitchen, fridge, coffee. Nearby are local small shops, grocery and access to subways stops (< 10min walk). This is a communal home with relaxed vibes. Cute stay, thank you!"

Lisel was also nice enough to let us check in a little earlier than expected due to our flight arriving early. That helped us out a LOT.  This was my first Air bnb experience and trip to New York. Thanks again for everything! It all turned out cool.

The room was generously sized. TV was fickle (but you're not in NY to watch the telly). The bed was very firm. Bathroom facilities were good. It was pretty much as explained in the ad. Very close to restaurants and the Barclays Centre and also a hub for transport."

Perfectly located and well connected, her place was great to spend the day walking and photographing and going out at night. We were welcomed and supported throughout the weekend and could probably even have gotten more out of the place and community had we not been out most of the time. We definitely recommend Lisel’s place to other travelers."

8025,554773,21/9/11,1104139,Shaun,"Lisel organised for us to stay with Fiona and Daniel in Marlborough Road. While this was a little further away (20-30min subway to Manhattan) we could not have been happier with our stay. They have a lovely old house an easy (5min) walk to the subway (Q and B lines). The family were welcoming and wonderful hosts, often offering us advise on sights to see, local places to eat and how to travel about town. The bedroom we stayed in was large and clean with a comfortable double bed and an ensuite with a shower over a large tub.  We could not recommend this lovely family more highly."
8025,664060,25/10/11,29417,Elizabeth,"I found the overall vibe of the guesthouse to be warm, welcoming and worldly - an ideal combination for a visit to the Big Apple. Park Slope is one of my favorite neighborhoods in Brooklyn and the Cbg guesthouse is in a great spot with so many great restaurants close by. The 2, 3, B and Q are all within a 6 or 7 min walk, so Manhattan is just a few stops away.

Lisel provides a great guesthouse with a great cause; I wholeheartedly recommend staying here. Bathrooms are shared, but kept so clean you feel like it's your own, and the kitchen is great for cooking or storing leftovers. 

Needless to say, I'm a fan and would stay here again in a new York minute."
8025,1725642,16/7/12,2222157,Kurt,Great location! Accommodations are casual.
8025,2325583,17/9/12,169351,Ankhasanamen,"I was in town to complete an orientation with Doctors Without Borders, so what better a place to stay than with Lisel, community organizer and friend of Haiti?
She has made her home into a welcoming place for true travelers and humanitarians. The bed was clean and comfy, the kitchen warm and welcoming and the garden truly a treat after a long day indoors in Manhattan! And not to mention tres pratique! Near great coffee and every train station you will ever need.
And it's so nice to know a portion of the fee goes to Haiti. I will stay there again and again...hope there's room, Lisel!"
8025,6984388,2/9/13,1364672,Chantell,"Lisel Burns offers a safe and very friendly sanctuary in a delightful part of Park Slope.  No fuss, no stress!  It felt good to contribute in some small way to her community-building vision.  Thanks, Lisel.
"
8025,7778179,2/10/13,8717574,Veronica,"Enjoyed my time in this brownstone at Park Slope in Brooklyn. Lisel, the host, although busy with her community work suggested various things  for me to do which I didn't have the time to take up, unfortunately.  It was good to be able to sit in the sunny backyard and watch the squirrels and see a different part of NY - as well as meet some locals and other guests. Really easy access to the Atlantic St \Barclay Centre subway and you can get anywhere fast. "
8025,8076055,14/10/13,7140032,Taro,Lisel was gracious enough to accommodate my friend and I even on a very short notice (we were attending a show in Manhattan coming from upstate). The room itself was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The house itself was also eclectic and I couldn't help but gaze at the various books and cultural artifacts that rested quietly on the shelves. Overall a good experience. Thanks Lisel!

8025,9557516,2/1/14,9839931,Katherine,"Lisel and Betsy were very accomodating! Betsy was at work when we arrived, but she left us a key so we could get in to the house before heading to Manhattan. Both the house and room were very nice. The location is very conveniently located -- close to at least two different subway stations. We only spent one night, but when asked to leave our luggage at the house on the second day so we wouldn't have to carry it around New York, they let us do so. The only thing that caught us off guard was that we had to move from Betsy's house to Lisel's (only a short walk down the street) at 11am after our night, and we were still asleep because of the late New Year's celebrations. It wasn't that big a deal; it just surprised us. "

Private room with comfortable beds. Close to Manhattan through subway, Prospect Park in walking distance, very nice neighborhood with some restaurants and bars if you wanna hang out. Take the time to have little talk to Lisel, she's an adorable person. I would definitely recommand it :)"

Perfect to enjoy some time outdoors or a morning cup of coffee. Will definitely be back!"

Lisel is very welcoming, providing a friendly and unique stay in New York City. If ever we had a problem or needed help, we could always find a solution with her. The environment is vibrant yet relaxed. With great company, the house makes its visitors feel like part of a community. You'll always feel safe and comfortable at Communitybegood, and have an amazing base for your trip to New York.

The room was exactly as advertised and is in a great location.  

Overall; a great stay and highly recommended.

8110,23545,7/1/10,63099,Gregor,"Our family of 5 (three nine year old children plus mum and dad) from the UK stayed at Ctybegood for a week over New Year.  We had a great time and feel very fortunate to have found such a lovely place.  The Citybegood house is an original brownstone with a bohemian vibe. Lisel et al are great people, with inspiring community values who really welcomed us and were always attentive and interested in our needs while respecting our space.
The Slope area in Brooklyn is a fantastic, thriving and buzzy place. There’s a great place for coffee as well as restaurants, and a large grocery store just at the bottom of the road, literally seconds away. 
The Subway is less than 5 minutes away and it only takes 10 minutes to Manhattan. 
We all had a great time with music and dance at Brooklyn museum, which has a free open evening the first Saturday of the month. If you’re more interested in community values rather than posh hotels then this is for you. 
"
8110,30664,21/3/10,94093,Mary Ellen,  Great location in the heart of Park Slope !  Very easy to check in and check out.  We would stay here again.

The area is beautiful, surrounded by nice restaurants, coffee places, and very close to all subways that can take you into the city in a matter of minutes. Lisel is very involved in social movements, which is inspiring and makes your stay with her so much more meaningful. "
8110,46278,25/5/10,114188,Lauren,"Lisel is very accommodating and very prompt to answer any questions - fast response to my emails. The brownstone is in a beautiful area of Park Slope with easy access to subways and shops.  We came and went with ease.  Thank you, Lisel!"
8110,50332,6/6/10,57953,Kevin,"Absolutely wonderful! It was such a joy to spend the weekend here.  It's a unique and comfy space, a large rambling house with an enormous back yard, but Lisel's hospitality is what makes this so special. I don't think I've ever felt so at home while traveling.
"
8110,106393,27/9/10,214895,Rosalba,"My husband and I had a very nice stay at Lisel's Cbg Guest House.  Our taxi cab was just taking off when I heard somebody saying, ""Bienvenidos!""  Lisel was waiting for us at the doorsteps, which made me feel at home immediately.  Cbg #2 room was clean and comfy and eclectically decorated.  She placed an additional sofa for our visitor daughters and asked me to choose a throw from her Guatemalan blankets.  We could use the kitchen freely and visitors are welcomed.  If you like to do yoga, there is a by donation place 2.5 blocks from the Guest House, and lots of places to eat or to have a cup of coffee. I heard from a couple of people that the best coffee in the neighborhood happens to be a few steps from Cbg. She is surrounded by nice & helpful people (Seija, Tasha, Cecilio, Martha, & Cheryl) We would go back to this place without hesitation.  Lisel: You were gone when we left, but thank you much  for your hospitality!  Jesus & Rosalba"
8110,117846,12/10/10,252819,Stephanie,"CBg Guest House was a great find. Lisel's terrific: kind, welcoming, curious about her guests but not intrusive, and ready with good advice about where to get good local coffee etc. She and the house are both very hospitable. The home and garden are relaxed, lived-in-but-clean, comfortable spaces. It's not for someone looking for a hotel-ish experience; more like staying with a really lovely friend-of-a-friend. Transportation to Manhattan is also a breeze, with a number of subway lines an easy walk away. I'll stay here again!"
8110,126023,24/10/10,214835,Christy,"I stayed in the front room on the middle floor @ CBG. Slept like a baby in the most comfortable bed ever. The room was comfy & warm. The other room on that floor doesn't have a window, which would be a drag. Didn't see the downstairs rooms, but the German couple who was staying there seemed happy. The bathroom on the 2nd floor is tiny & the shower is in the living room (very odd), but the other bathroom on the 1st floor is lovely and big (with an accessible shower if you need it). Nice big kitchen if you want to cook for yourself or hang out with the other guests. The location was absolutely perfect for me - I don't really know anything about NYC and was a little nervous about walking around alone at night in Brooklyn. Park Slope is sort of upper middle class hipster chic - lots of indie bakeries, coffee shops & boutiques. Strollers everywhere. You're in between 3 or 4 subway stations & a short walk from the LIRR from JFK. Couldn't be more convenient. There's a grocery store across the street & a Target a couple of blocks away if you forgot anything. Lisel is super nice, though we only met once. Only thing odd is that it's kind of like staying in your aunt's spare room, but you have to pay her $130 - that's what AirBNB is for, though. For me it was definitely worth it as a single woman who wanted safety & convenience. If you're more familiar with Brooklyn or traveling in a group you could probably stay in a dodgier neighborhood cheaper. Still cheaper than any hotel you'll ever find. Highly recommended. Thanks, Lisel!"
8110,223347,11/4/11,358693,Jugurtha,"Cbg Guest House is very warm, serene abode. Its location is ideal: it gives one immediate access to 5th Avenue's section Union-Street-to-15th-Street-and-above area. At the same time, it gives one access to the Vanderbilt, Atlantic, etc., Avenues' universe. Even more important, it is just a couple blocks from Prospect Park. What's not to like. Quality eating places and specialty-coffee store abound. So do the subway stops. Lisel is an extraordinarily welcoming, laid-back yet thorough, alert landlady. Every single aspect of my experience has been perfect. Highly recommended."
8110,335870,26/6/11,572934,Sarah,"CBG was a lovely place to stay - as others have said, it's a home away from home. I recently travelled alone from Australia to NY and of the three places I stayed during my trip this was definitely the best. Lisel allowed me to book a room at CBG on short notice and was very welcoming. I didn't see much of her as I was not there for long and she had her own business to attend to, however, from the conversations we had, I found her to be an interesting and friendly person. The house itself is really cute and full of colourful, hippy charm. There is a gorgeous garden out back, big kitchen, great shower, comfortable rooms, lots of paintings, mosaics and books. I stayed in the front room (downstairs) and although I was only there one night it was the little sanctuary I needed after such a long and stressful trip getting to NY. I was able to come and go as I pleased without infringing upon anyone (I spent the night out with friends and returned quietly and easily at 4am through the lower level entrance right next to my room). Lisel allowed me to stay late into the following afternoon so I could wait for a friend to come meet me. The bed was comfortable and Lisel provided both towels and toiletries. The area itself, Park Slope, is a beautiful part of Brooklyn - I wish I could've stayed longer to explore it more. For anyone who is unsure of where to stay in Brooklyn due to safety or cost, this place is definitely value for money and it is located in one of the nicest and safest areas of Brooklyn. The subway station is 2 mins up the road. I went walking here alone both during the day and night (4am from main st back to CBG) and found it to be a very quiet, safe and interesting area. There are plenty of shops, places to eat, friendly people, beautiful Brownstones, trees and birds. All in all a great place to stay, I highly recommend CBG and I will hopefully be back next time I come to NY.  "
8110,465183,22/8/11,564412,Cecile,"A great homely address ! We were a real tribe, coming from France with four adults et five children, and everybody found his place in this great and friendly house. 
Lisel is a very kind host, ready to give you some advice for your visit. And the location in Brooklyn, with the wild little garden, is perfect to rest after long walks in Manhattan. 
We hope to come again. Cecile & co."
8110,519638,10/9/11,877132,"Ang, Simon And Remy","The CBG is a very homely, clean and comfortable place that is located not too far from Manhattan (took us about 20 minutes to get where we needed to be when we stayed there). Lisel was kind enough to help us when we needed a place to stay. Unfortunately Lisel was away, so we met by Roman who was friendly and very accommodating.

The big disappointment (aside from not being able to stay longer) was not getting a chance to meet Lisel as she has quite an eclectic library. "

8110,754096,29/11/11,1389847,Melissa,We were lucky to find a place to stay so close to our daughter in Brooklyn.  It was really fun to actually see the inside of a brownstone!  We don't have such things in Texas.  Our bed was comfortable and the water was hot in the shower.  What more could we ask for?
8110,765676,5/12/11,1430838,Sarah,Had a very nice stay at the Cbg Guest House.  It is very comfortable and so conveniently located.  Accomodated my family of 4 perfectly for a one-night trip to Brooklyn.  Hope to stay their again soon.
8110,780355,12/12/11,1449851,Nathanael,"Our host was extremely nice and the location could not have been better, just off of 5th Avenue in Park Slope and within easy access of the 1/9 
trains and easy walking distance of the Atlantic/Pacific hub. And 5th Avenue is the place to be in Park Slope with all the best restaurants and nightlife. The Key Food just down the street is a great resource that you can use if planning to cook in the well-stocked kitchen. We were in town 
for a wedding and my mother-in-law had some issues with the place she had been supposed to stay, and Lisel was extremely helpful in our efforts to find a place for my mother-in-law (the mother of the bride, in fact)--and in the end, my mother-in-law stayed here, too. CBG is a little unconventional in their approach--as Lisel put it ""we're a little quirky, but if you like quirky we a great place to stay."" I like quirky and we had 
a great experience. On top of that, the CBG mission (helping those in need in Haiti) is admirable and I am glad that some of the money I paid is going to that cause. I would certainly stay here again."
8110,1445409,9/6/12,2469242,Hannah,"Just the perfect place to experience Brooklyn (and I guess, if you can make the time, Manhattan ;) It's a cozy, charming and homey place to stay. Warm, considerate hosts. I highly recommend. I'm so glad I found them!"

We were due in NYC in just a couple of days, and had experienced a cancellation from another host,  so we were very grateful for Cbg being available and helpful at the last minute. Lisel was very friendly and I greatly appreciate her involvement with helping the poor in Haiti.  Her fascinating and eclectic home was welcoming almost to a fault - I felt a bit like I was intruding in her personal space.  We were just there to sleep and bathe, so we didn't use the kitchen or backyard garden, but they were lovely as well."
8110,2734122,27/10/12,3390211,Steven,"Lisel is the most amazing hostess. She stocks her home with everything you could possibly need, and made my stay very easy and enjoyable. Park Slope is a lot of fun. There are more people smiling in Park Slope than there are people smiling in the whole of Manhattan.

Also, Lisel gave them the same discount to her price this week as the one last week and we're forever grateful to her for that. Her communication with me continues to be stellar. Lisel's a great host to my  parents. "
8110,4942446,3/6/13,6023013,Maureen,"My friend and I enjoyed a fabulous four nights at Community Be Good and felt right at home. Lisel is a warm and caring woman who is most welcoming. We were unprepared for the sudden heatwave, but the next day a window air-conditioner had been installed. We loved meeting the other guests, especially the families. Loved the garden and the hammocks. The neighbourhood is vibrant with so many excellent places to eat. It was an oasis to return home to after the mayhem of Manhattan. We enjoyed exploring Brooklyn. The Museum was wonderful as was our visit to the Wyckoff Farmhouse. Loved chatting with Lisel. I'll return again for sure! Thank-you for making us feel so at homel!"
8110,5152255,15/6/13,6754862,Jonathan,"We enjoyed our visit here. We had a fairly large private room with a double bed,  an air conditioner, ceiling fan and couch. The room was clean and comfortable and it was only a couple blocks away from our daughter. The convenient location was the primary factor in making our determination to stay here, but the friendly atmosphere and comfortable room made it a very nice stay. "
8110,6174783,2/8/13,6562197,Brooke,"We stayed with Lisel for a little over a month while looking for a permanent place to live in Brooklyn. If you are staying more than a few nights, expect to become part of the household. The front room is large, and you will have your privacy whenever you wish. Lisel is a fascinating woman, and does some amazing charitable and community work both in NY and Haiti. If you desire, you'll have the chance for some interesting conversation or to read something from the formidable collection of books in the house.

CBG feels more like an eclectic share house than a guest house, which was great for us, but may not suit everyone. As part of a household, you might need to be flexible. Lisel asked me to move rooms for a few nights around July 4th so she could accommodate a family who had nowhere else to stay. Sure, that might be a tad inconvenient, but as I found out later, I was actually moving to Lisel's own room while she slept on a cot in the basement in order to accommodate everyone who needed a place to stay. If you think that was a pretty awesome thing for somebody to do, then this is the place for you. For people with the right mindset, CBG is highly recommended."
8110,8624066,9/11/13,9009699,Leslie,"Lisel is an excellent host, and Community Be Good is a friendly, safe, clean place to stay. There's a community fridge and kitchen, as well as easy access to the subway. For the NYC area, the place is fairly quiet inside and out. This place is for open-hearted travelers ."
8110,9261340,16/12/13,4173393,Olivia,The stay was great. SO happy to have found such a host in the same neighborhood of the venue the band was performing. Lisel was a great and welcoming host.

8110,18622431,29/8/14,18067085,Liz,My husbsnd and I had a wonderful stay at Lisel's. Great atmosphere and fabulous location. Lots of common space to spread out and enjoy when not sight seeing.
8110,18733863,31/8/14,6883769,Kati,"The place was sooo nice! The nice brownstone with the nice colorful entry and stairs welcomes its guests from the very first moment. You feel that it's home and that a colorful, traveling, open and social person (Lisel) lives over there. You feel like part of the house and of the area when you stay there for some days. It's very centered and at the same time in one of the nices streets in Brooklyn, Park Slope. There are other nice houses around it and nice people on the street, and trees and it's nice and calm but not lonely as there are the people on the street who live there all some time. Just around the corner there is a great coffee (Gorilla Coffee) great small shops for food, fresh fruits, clothes, cute - cosy - lively - comfortable pubs, bars and cafes just 2 minutes away in 5th Street with great food, music etc. All what you need is there. You can reach the subway by foot in 5-10 minutes in all directions. In a few minutes you are directly in Manhattan or in some more minutes in other parts of New York or down at the beach. :-)
A great place to stay... the house itsself as well locationwise the surroundings. The room was cozy and the bed comfortable and colorful :-) Lisel was really nice to meet and talk too! We would really recommend her great house! Plus the social issue behind it, which every person automatically donates for through paying the room :-) Thank  you Lisel and New York for welcoming us and letting us have such a great time!"

8110,27310215,1/3/15,4953547,David,"Had a good few days here. After a dull few days in a chain hotel nearby, I was glad of the colour, character, perhaps a little chaos, of CommunityBeGood. Loses lovely and helpful. Location convenient for Park Slope, and close to metro into Manhattan. "
8110,28768335,29/3/15,30057968,Susan,The hostess greeted me at the front door at the time I said I would come and made me feel welcome.  The neighborhood was perfect and the artwork in her home lovely.
8110,32224655,15/5/15,22739354,Jenny,"Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for a safe, clean and convenient place to stay in Brooklyn. The host is kind, considerate and generous. She is using her own house to do the Airbnb housing as a charitable fund-raising project for people in Haiti. In one word, if you want to have a wonderful stay and do some good deeds at the same time, just contact the host!!! "
8110,39709761,25/7/15,39147650,William`,"I had a wonderful experience at this B & B.  My room was very clean and comfortable.  I appreciated the shared facilities: large, comfortable kitchen, dining room and garden seating in the yard.  The shower was large and clean.  Host Lisel was conscientious, knowledgeable, hospitable, thorough and interesting.  Her recommendations for neighborhood restaurants were helpful and on track for my interests.  I enjoyed chatting with her about her involvements in community and social action.  
This was my first air bnb experience.  I usually stay in corporate hotels  when I travel for business, but this time I wanted to get a sense of the Brooklyn neighborhood - Mission accomplished.  The air bnb listing was accurate describing the facility and room.  Also, staying here, I was more able to connect with the community.  And it's true, and important, that part of the fee for your room goes as a contribution to a charity that supports redevelopment in Haiti.  
So an excellent experience overall.  I'll return to this place and am encouraged to try other air bnb listings.  "
8110,48034584,22/9/15,11379023,Rarnee,"this was my first Airbnb home stay, & initially I had some trepidation, until I spoke with Lisel on the phone..I was put @ ease, & from the moment of my arrival @ CommunityBeGood I felt @ home...Lisel welcomed me & familiarised me with the home...such a lovely home, I was blessed with the master bedroom; wonderful space & beautiful sense of cleanliness & Presence throughout the whole home, gorgeous community of guests--made new connections, home is conveniently located in what I consider to be one of the best areas of Brooklyn; great atmosphere & some of the best quality food in NYC...a home away from home for me, I had no desire to leave, & would love to return...a wonderful beginning to my Airbnb experience, thank you ever so much Lisel & guests...xOx"
8110,101854134,15/9/16,88271547,Marium,"Lisel was very hospitable. On arriving we got a tour of the place and helped us get comfortable. She gave us the keys and also a general information about the area. There were plenty of sheets, towels and other things for immediate use. We also had some interaction with guests from different parts of the world visiting NY including activists and artists. The place was clean and very close to busy Ave., where we were able to find lots of restaurants and bars. The proximity to prospect park was a great plus too. "
8110,124736184,2/1/17,45748711,Shang,"Lisel is a pretty nice host and the location is super good. It's near two metro stations with all the lines you need to get to any places in Manhattan. The 5th ave nearby has so many good restaurants. You don't have a private bathroom. The shared bathrooms are clean but shampoos and body washes are almost running out. The sofa bed is more comfortable than i thought, which is good. The real bed is small and can only fit one person. "
8110,150340234,7/5/17,29512867,Tim,"I'm one that is easily satisfied as long as my accommodations are clean. Unfortunately, this was not the case here. I couldn't believe the condition of the bedding. I had to find clean bedding in the bathroom and change it myself."
8110,189701124,2/9/17,6793722,Corrie,Lisel is fantastic and went above and beyond to be an amazing host!

Very clean and relaxed house. Lisel was so flexible with the details of our stay, such as check in and check out. Highly recommended!"

Lisel gives so much back to her community. It was a pleasure to meet and get to know her. She is a remarkable soul. This trip has been amazing and we look forward to the next time we can stay here. 
Thank you so much!!"
8110,210657307,10/11/17,41101567,Carly,"Just as described, it was a cozy room in a fantastic location. Lisel and the other guests/habitants were all lovely, it was nice and quiet all the time. The location is great, lots of places to eat, hang out and explore nearby. We will be back again!"
8110,213872859,23/11/17,24104008,Vasily&Aglaya,"We have chosen Lisel's place for our short NYC Thanksgiving escape. Our main consideration was Park Slope, but the social impact story behind the place also sounded attractive. It all ended as ambient and atmospheric experience in a very special home where we finally spent around 2 hours just talking to the host and sharing a Thanksgiving dinner. What I did not expect of what looked like an informal guesthouse, was a feel of ultimate home-like comfort. We even had a bathrobe! Little elements of style, paintings, books, decorations, toys for our daughter... this is why we choose airbnb when we travel! And the charity thing behind it all just adds the flavor! We will be happy to come back."
8110,217931519,10/12/17,2383418,Electra,"We felt home the minute that we had stepped through the front gates! The Brownstone is in a great neighborhood! I felt as if she was ""my favorite aunt"" that I was coming to visit, as Lisel makes the space truly feel like home.....

 It is warm and filled with with bright colors, beautiful artwork and positive energy. Diversity, equality, and empowerment is supported!  She is an avid recycler as we are which is awesome to see! There were ""guest"" shelves with snacks/food items  that we could have.

There amazing bookshelves line the walls in many different spaces, and the multitude of spiritual, personal growth, self-help, daily-meditations etc.  
I am excited to book again, and plan on doing so soon! ☮️❤️😁"
8110,220734125,23/12/17,18147248,Crystal,"We had a good time: comfortable room, clean bathroom and kitchen, easy conversation with Lisel & other guests. A great option in the great neighborhood."
8110,223046862,31/12/17,48326857,Daniel,"From the moment we stepped foot into this amazing brownstone, Lisel made us feel right at home. The room was large and super comfortable. The outside temps may have been freezing, but we were cozy and warm in our peaceful surroundings. Lisel’s home is quiet, yet it is vibrant and full of life. Lisel goes out of her way to make sure her guests are familiarized with the ins and outs of the house, and that they feel comfortable accessing all there is to offer. She is very knowledgeable about the neighborhood as well as local  sites and transportation options. This home is run from the heart, and you feel the love when you are there."
8110,270177172,28/5/18,37694722,Damon,Lisel's place was great.  Rm 2 is a nice bedroom (1 bed and a pull-out coach).  We especially enjoyed the backyard space where you can sit-out and relax.  The location is also great - close to the metro and prospect park with a lot of great restaurants near by.

8110,311112805,20/8/18,6438253,Chelsea,"Lisel is very warm and welcoming, and the location is great. Unfortunately I was not aware that this is a hostel with many guests, as opposed to a single family home with one or two rooms rented out. In light of that, it didn’t work for my needs, however Lisel very understanding and helpful in the cancellation process."
8110,314970495,27/8/18,74538232,Cheyenne,"Lisel is an enthusiastic and helpfulness hostess who is also very passionate about her help with the Haiti fund. She gave us lots of information and printed our tickets for a festival! Would definitely stay again, the neighbourhood is great! Thanks 😊"

Thanks!"

8225,60454,3/7/10,150350,Timothy,Stephanie was a wonderful host. She was very knowledgeable about the city and offered great input while my wife and I were considering where to move in New York. The apartment was in a great location and the room was clean. It was very easy to find parking as well. We would recommend her accommodations to anyone.

8225,112722,6/10/10,90723,Paul,"Stephanie was a very genuine lady who did her best to help as much as she could. She is a very busy person so it was sometimes a bit difficult to touch base with her.
Her maison d'art appartment was very quiet, private and well appointed with a classy private (Website hidden by Airbnb) is well located to the subway and a variety of good eateries.
She recommended the nearby jazz place and I was very glad she told me because I thought it was a terrific New york experience."

8225,251861,5/5/11,353409,Courtney,My friend and i  stayed with Stephanie for 4 days back in May. She was an excellent host and made us feel so welcome. The location was great and very close walking distance to the metro!! Would definitely stay there again if i went back to New York.
8225,259195,11/5/11,258567,Hans,"We loved staying with Stephanie, the only down point was that we had to walk up to the 4th floor with our suitcases because there's no lift in the building.

8225,271979,20/5/11,500969,Jessica,"Stephanie and her family were very friendly and welcoming. We really enjoyed our stay here, plenty of privacy even though you are in someone's house, very clean and only about a 10-15 minute subway ride into times square."

8225,316513,15/6/11,621989,Mari,"The apartment is located in Harlem, conveniently one block from the 110th street [A, B, C] and Central Park North [2, 3] subway stations which take you to the more exciting neighborhoods such as Midtown and the Villages. As noted in the description, the apartment is located on the 4th floor and requires you to walk up very narrow flights of stairs. Hence, if you have lots of heavy luggage and/or are physically unable to walk up stairs, it may not be convenient. Note that the bathroom is shared with the guests in the other room. I did not have any difficulty with scheduling usage but if you like privacy, keep this in mind. Also, I noted a strange smell in the hallways of the apartment. If you are sensitive to these smells, you may need to hold your nose (as I had to do)."
8225,370591,13/7/11,663377,Lisa,"Although we were unable to meet Stephanie as she was away on business, her husband was very accomodating and helpful. The room and amenities were as described and we had a pleasant stay at their location. Thank you again! :)"
8225,407988,31/7/11,479390,Lee Ann,"Excellent location. The subway and bus were only a block from the apartment. We could get to Museum Mile in less than 20 minutes from the apartment. We arrived from Florida during a heatwave and the window air conditioner in the bedroom was a welcome relief. Sophie checked us in and made sure we were settled with maps and tour books. The apartment was clean, well kept and as advertised. "
8225,424331,6/8/11,873008,Patricia,"This was a great apartment, very clean and organized. It was very helpful that Sophie had a package ready for me with maps, recommended places and a guide with events happening in NYC. I would have been lost without those guides! Great hospitality. The apartment is located on the northern part of Manhattan which is more residential and less touristy, but very close to the subway station. Great hosts, thank you so much for everything!"
8225,442681,13/8/11,759660,Rene,"Had a nice few days at Stephanie's place. Stephanie was not there, but a friend/partner of hers met me and set up my visit. She was helpful and friendly as was Stephanie's husband. Slight confusion about my check in day, but it worked out with little drama. Room wasn't decorated or anything, but clean with an a/c unit, desk and comfortable bed.  Shared clean bathroom with other travelers who were also friendly. I felt comfortable with everyone there. Wifi access worked well. Location convenient to subway systems and a few businesses one avenue over. Fourth floor walkup, which was not a problem for me, but others should take note. Again, I had a good experience here. "
8225,448509,15/8/11,949298,Linda,"Sophie and Stephanie's husband were very hospitable. The location is good, very close to transportation. It just wasn't that clean, I found some bugs in the kitchen drawer. Other than that it was ok."
8225,461860,21/8/11,418922,Kathleen,"Excellent value for money, a very clean tidy apartment. and plenty of clean linen.  Using the kitchen and late checkout a real bonus. Stephanie was away but Sophie was friendly and helpful, Sharing a bathroom could be a problem with inconsiderate other guests.  Close to Subway stations"
8225,470193,23/8/11,937263,Kendall,"Stephanie was not in town while I was there, but her husband was present and he was very nice and helpful. Stephanie's friend, Sophie, met us, gave us the keys and a tour of the apartment. She also provided maps, an events brochure and local restaurant ideas. The whole house was clean. My friend and I needed to leave our bags at the apartment after we checked out and they were very accommodating. It was a wonderful experience."
8225,577432,28/9/11,869241,Erica,"Stephanie and husband were very friendly and gave lots of helpful info about the area when we got there. The room and apt were clean and pleasant. They were available to chat, yet were not intrusive at all. Quiet apt overall. Fellow guest was polite and cooperative too, in regards to sharing the bathroom. "
8225,587642,1/10/11,1183276,Rochelle,"Stephanie is a wonderful host, we were made to feel very welcome and comfortable for our stay in New York. Very convenient location near the subway and central park, close enough to get to Times Square in about 15 minutes but far enough out to escape the tourists when you've had enough. Stephanie has lots of knowledge about where to go and what to see in the local area, more than willing to share information but also gives you space and privacy. Would love to have had the time to explore more of Harlem itself."
8225,608334,8/10/11,1000518,Charlotte,"Good location, good price and nice hosts. Thank you for your hospitality and help throughout the city. We enjoyed our stay! Tip: go to the baptist church on sunday, it's located near the apartment and is truly worth experiencing. "

8225,638652,17/10/11,1249046,Derrick,"STephanie's cozy room was a major godsend for my girlfriend and i . We braved the highways and drove up from D.C. to Harlem for a reading I was a part of at NYC. We knew the hotels were super pricey and we decided to try airbnb on a whim. Best decision ever. Stephanie's friend met us with the keys once we arrived and led us to our small bedroom. Although there were other guests there, we mostly saw Stephanie, her hubby Abulai, and their cute as a button son. Great location to the subway and it was nice to be able to walk less than a few feet and end up right at the top of Central Park.

We lucked out that Friday afternoon and found a great parking spot across the street and we left our car there the whole weekend with no problems or tickets.

We read in one persons description that there was a weird smell in the apartment. Not true. If anything, the stairwell of the building was where the weird smell was and the apartment smelled fine.  Over all a great time was had. We didn't really use the kitchen at all or the living room space because we were out in the city during the day, but overall we felt welcomed, safe, and secure."
8225,715744,14/11/11,1149432,Jose Manuel,"Stephanie's family and apartment was great, we stayed for a week at her house and it was the best. NY offers a really tiring experience and you need to have a good night's sleep to keep up with its speed, and staying at Stephanie's really made that possible. One of the best things about it was the closeness to 2 subway stations, central park is just one block to the south. Great neighborhood, very calm. Also her family was the best, her husband was really nice to us and we loved her little boy. As an extra tip you should visit her art gallery, great exhibits of artists around the world."
8225,729256,19/11/11,1183689,Nicholas & Sophie,"Stephanie is a great host, she is friendly, welcoming and gave us all the information we needed to have a great time in New York city.

We had a great time and were pleasantly surprised by the hospitality of our hosts. The room we stayed in was small, but the bed was good. Bathroom is shared with the other guests, which means you may have to wait during morning rush hour. Location is great: outside the bustle of down town, but with good connections (subway, bus). Stephanie provides an extensive list of restaurants, cafe's and entertainment options in the neighbourhood, a safe and relatively quiet part of town.

Despite that it could at times feel a bit crowded as the apartment is quite small. We were also a bit surprised that cooking availability was limited to only micro wave use in evenings. Overall it was satisfying though as what we prioritize most, location, was perfect!"

8225,22361699,4/11/14,151894,Eliza,"We enjoyed our stay at Stephanies apartment. Its small but has the conveniences you need. Bed and a shower. We didn't use the kitchen very much bc we chose to eat out. I did get a cup of coffee sometimes from their coffee machine. Her children are quiet and respectful. No problems with noise. They were sweet and cute boys! Stephanie has lots of good information to share about sightseeing and how to get around. She is very polite and a lovely lady. We enjoyed our stay but the 3 flights of stairs with luggage or after a hard day of walking made it difficult for me. I loved the location as far as walking into Central Park. It has some beautiful trails for walking during the day. We had a hard time finding a good breakfast in the area. Just not enough good places until you get over to Broadway and thats where its all at. Thanks again Stephanie for a comfortable, private stay. Hope to see you again .

La calidad humana con la que nos trato Mizi y su familia es sumamente increíble. En resumen una excelente ubicación, grandes personas que nos tratan como parte de su familia.

Die Lage war einmalig, direkt am Nordrand des Central Park gelegen, zwei Subway Stationen in unmittelbarer Nähe. Ein Spaziergang abends durch Harlem war völlig problemlos. Es gab viele Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und Gaststätten in der Umgebung. 
Stephanie war sehr freundlich und immer ansprechbar. Wir hatten viel Spaß zusammen. Morgens haben wir in der Küche gefrühstückt und sie  hatte ihre beiden Söhne für die Schule fertig gemacht. So hatte man auch einen kleinen Einblick in das amerikanische Familienleben. 
Geschätzt haben wir die Nähe zum Central Park. Einen frischen Salat, Brot und Getränke besorgt, ab in den Park 
und das Picknick genossen.  Herrlich diese Ruhe nach einem hektischen Tag in der Innenstadt. 
Wir können diese Unterkunft uneingeschränkt empfehlen.

8225,158035239,5/6/17,112923946,Alysia,"We had a wonderful time staying in this beautiful apartment with her and her family! While its on the 4th floor and there is many stairs to climb, we had an overall great experience. Got to share the bathroom with on other room - if the other room is booked. Thats really the only problem we faced. Whenever we tried to use the bathroom someone was almost always in there. There is an air conditioner in the room, if you stay in the warmer months. The room is comfortable for three - there is a bunk bed in the room. There is a TV - not that you'll use it. The apartment is in an amazing location. Around the corner is a deli, dunkin dounuts, and the subway which connects you to the 2 and 3 train. If you go the opposite direction there is another subway at the corner of central park which connects you to the A, C, B, and D train. Stephanie is very helpful, and patient. Expecally because we told her we'd get there at one time - but our flight ended up getting extreamly delayed. Had an amazing stay here, and would recommend it to anyone who is coming to new york."
8225,160735724,15/6/17,105305331,Ivan,"Mizi was great, nice place, her family so cute, I don't forget her hospitality and amiability, Place recomended 100% ."
8225,165249981,30/6/17,79575571,Denise Villen,"Eu e meu marido ficamos no apartamento da Mizi e foi incrível.
A localização é excelente, é bem pertinho do Central Park e o bairro é tranquilo e residencial. O quarto é ótimo, silencioso e mais amplo do que imaginávamos. A cama e travesseiros também são excelentes. O banheiro é muito bom e o fato de dividi-lo com outros hóspedes não foi inconveniente nenhum.
No primeiro dia da nossa hospedagem a Mizi nos reservou um hotel em Midtown (os hóspedes anteriores precisaram ficar um dia a mais) e ela nos pagou um taxi no dia seguinte do hotel ate o apartamento.
A Mizi é muito atenciosa e dá todas as dicas principalmente referente às facilidades do bairro.
Durante nossa hospedagem ela teve que viajar e ficou ausente por alguns dias. Neste período tivemos pequeno problema com a limpeza e higiene na cozinha (que é uma área compartilhada com os demais).
Mas este problema foi muito pequeno perto dos momentos maravilhosos que tivemos em NY e no apartamento.
Fizemos confusão com o horario do check out e sabemos que ocasionou um transtorno com a limpeza do quarto para os proximos hóspedes e agradecemos à Mizi imensamente pela sua compreensão e flexibilidade."

Die Zimmer sind jeweils mit einem Stockbett (unten 140 cm, oben 90 cm breit),  Schreibtisch, Kleiderschrank und Sitzecke eingerichtet. AC, Deckenventilator, und sehr schöne Bilder.

We speak Spanish and she tried to speak Spanish also so we could understand better. She was very specific about the rules of the house and places we could go to!  It’s well located and the bus stoped near. It’s close to the subway too! We will certainly go back there!!

8343,458139,19/8/11,886714,Philip,Nice  and comfortable.  We were 4 and needed 3 bedrooms.  The apartment is spacious and  in a nice low key area.  Lots of good restaurants and very close to Tompkins Sq Park.    Subway reasonably close.  Lori was very good about communicating with us and answered all questions promptly.  Very nice
8343,840780,6/1/12,387377,Marcus,"My family and I had an amazing stay in Lori's apartment over the new year, 2011/12.  I didn't know the East Village well, but it was great to live in the heart of this up-and-coming neighborhood.  The apartment is situated a few steps from a park and St Mark's Place (a very 'happening' street). The apartment is large by New York standards.  It was clean and in good condition.  It also felt safe an secure.  The kitchen was particularly nice.  It was great to have a big bathroom as well as a smaller 'half-bath'.  There was free WiFi, and a free washing machine in the basement.  Lori was also able to arrange a mid-stay cleaning, which was great for us, with five people using the bathrooms.  Lori was great to deal with and was quick to respond to all of my emails.  I love to spend time in New York and walk everywhere, but some people may find the East Village a little 'under-serviced' by subways.  It's a good 15+ minute walk to the nearest station.  But I would definitely stay here again, and have already recommended it to my friends.  Thanks Lori!"
8343,4861770,29/5/13,762397,James,"Very comfortable apartment in a great neighborhood! The apt is spacious, clean, quiet, away from street noise. We felt very safe & welcome here. Location a few steps up from street level (in walk-up building) was good for my elderly mother. Excellent communication with host Lori and attention to our particular needs; plenty of clear, helpful instructions. The East Village neighborhood at her doorstep offers lots of restaurants, a couple of groceries & beautiful Tomkins Square Park within very easy walking distance - also several city bus routes. An ideal, friendly base for enjoying the city!"
8343,6093154,29/7/13,71478,Pablo,The place is good and well priced. i assumed to feed the cats for a small discount that later regreted to.
8343,16297763,25/7/14,4580387,Debora,"Ficamos muito bem instalados, a proprietaria não estava presente mas esteve sempre pronta  a resolver tudo com muita rapidez por email e telefone, quem nos recebeu foi outra pessoa. Lori, desde o inicio dos contatos, quis saber quantos eramos e quis nos instalar da melhor maneira possivel, o que realmente ocorreu. Ficamos com seus gatos, pois haviamos dito que gostavamos. O apto fica em um bairro tranquilo, perto de um parque e proximo a varios restaurante e uma agitada vida noturna, o que não atrapalha a tranquilidade do apartamento. Fizemos tudo a pé e com metro, sem problemas. Quando voltar a NY certamente gostaria de ficar no apto da Lori que por sinal tem uma energia muito positiva."
8343,16858884,3/8/14,2736525,Daniel,"Lori was an absolute pleasure to deal with, she was very welcoming and helpful in every possible aspect. Her home was lovely, very neat and more importantly very comfortable. The surrounding neighborhood was wonderful, with plenty of interesting stores to check out and great restaurants and bars.

All in all, a perfect experience, and I would not hesitate to stay again!"
8343,17686888,16/8/14,10016434,Zoe,My workmates and I stayed at lori's place for 10 days. The apartment was lovely with plenty of room (although the third bedroom is very small - probably better for a child). It is in a fantastic location - lots of restaurants and bars in the surrounding streets as well as a gorgeous park just across the road. It is also very quiet - we had no problems with sleeping at all.  It was great to come home to such a peaceful place after the hustle and bustle of being out in the city. There were plenty of transport options close by - no more than 10 mins to the subway and a few different buses very nearby. I would highly recommend this apartment if you are looking for a place to stay in NY. We had a great time here. 
8343,18249983,24/8/14,3329088,Victor,"In summary - a clean, spacious and brilliantly decorated flat in a convenient and quiet East Village location, with a responsive and friendly hostess.

The flat is in a great location in the East Village, near the famous Katz's Delicatessen and St Mark's place (a street - the heart of the East Village), yet is tucked away in a very quiet street. It is a short walk away from a stop on the grey L metro line, but we walked most of our week in Manhattan.

The flat itself is brilliant - it was unexpectedly spacious! Large dining and lounge room, including a well-stocked and modern kitchen. We hosted dinner twice in the apartment and found it to be perfect.
3 bedrooms with 3 beds each was ideal for myself and 2 other friends to have a bed each.
And two toilets meant no fighting!
Also, just a small but cool thing - Lori has wireless speakers that can play music from an iPhone/iPod - perfect for having music on while in the flat.

Lori (hostess) was very responsive and detailed in her correspondence. Also very flexible in our very late check-in and our check-out.
She made our stay as comfortable as possible!

Thanks for letting us enjoy your apartment for a great week in NYC!"
8343,41764841,9/8/15,35341830,Michael,"Lori's home was absolutely perfect for our family of four! It was a nice, quiet respite after busy days of touring the city.  It was exactly as Lori represented, and Lori provided a manual of helpful tips for the home and surrounding area. Lori was easy to work with, super responsive, and we would plan to stay in Lori's home again if our travels bring us back to NYC."
8343,58335622,2/1/16,26435777,Raul,The Apartment was very very clean and big... We had a extraordinary time in New York. Lori was very diligent ensuring all our expectations were meet. It's also very centric good bars and restaurants 
8343,300215929,1/8/18,114334064,Maximilian,"We stayed at Lori's place for 10 days during the end of July. The apartment lies in a great neighbourhood, is spacious, quiet, and stayed comfortably cool despite the summer heat. Our host was very friendly, helpful and accommodating in every regard, with all amenities being provided. In short, it was a great stay. If you want to spend some time in Manhattan, this is definitely a great place to do so."
8343,304468355,9/8/18,184380557,Alexandrine,"Lori answered to all our questions very fast and clearly, Rosa gived us the keys and she tooks the time to speak with us and explain us everything, both are so kind !!
The district is very cute and pretty, there is a big garden just next to the flat ! 
The flat is big and the AC was so pleasant in the flat because it was hot outside. Everything was totally clean and beds are very confortable, definitly, this flat is a perfect place to visit and enjoy NYC !!!"
8343,307589031,14/8/18,15180429,Mary Jane,"Thank you Lori for opening up your lovely home to my family and friend. Your place was perfect for the location, things to do in the neighborhood.  It truly was a quite getaway and did not seem like we were in the middle of NY city. The layout of your place was so accommodating to many people without feeling cramped, but also a nice living space to share food and company family time. Second bathroom was dreamy. We felt safe in the area and in your place. Your were a doll to leave me messages and I loved the small notes to guide us in the house. Being from Seattle, the little rain we saw did not slow us down. That said, we left two cheap rain coats in case someone could use them. I highly recommend Lori's place to friends and family.❤️"
8477,9573,9/9/09,14224,Amanda,"Juttas place is very clean and spacious. It has everything you may need. The location is great for exploring the north of NYC.

However carry light cases as there are a few stairs to climb..."

Fully furnished kitchen, really usefull. 24 hours convenient store downstairs. The apt is well decorated and the furnitures are beautiful! We really felt home. Working A/C, full size fridge, plenty of space to store our luggage, very well located to visit the whole NYC, little too north to enjoy the heart of Chelsea. Really enjoyed my first trip to NYC and will definitely be back, maybe at Jutta's! Would definitely recommand it.
N'hésitez pas à me joindre si vous avez des questions! "
8477,112546,5/10/10,232763,Barbara,"Although my red-eye plane arrived late, Jutta waited for me so that she could hand over the keys; I was glad to be able to take a nap (vs. a hotel check-in at 3 pm or later).  She's outfitted and decorated her place nicely; it's a model of compact design! Quiet, clean (no bugs!),comfy and close to 2 subway lines. 
   About 8 NYC hosts I interacted with (just in trying to book a place) were a bit difficult--not responding at all; slow to respond; confirming their place as available & then saying they had to check their schedule; confirming it as available and then withdrawing it (& one even re-listing it at a higher price); etc. Jutta is 1 of the 3 NYC hosts who was straightforward and prompt--no game playing. 
    p.s. If you like bagels, I found Murray's has terrific ones; it's just a few blocks away on 8th.

It is definitely a truck up to the top floor with luggage...but thanks to our guys, not too bad:)
I would definitely recommend Jutta's place and would love to come back and stay there on our next trip to the city.  Thanks Jutta!"

El apartamento està en una zona excelente, con estaciones de metro y tren a tan solo 2-3 calles.
El edifcio es viejo y hay que subir 3 plantas sin ascensor pero esta decorado de forma muy funcional, con wifi. La unica pega es la poca presion de la ducha. Pero el resto genial, toallas limpias, sabanas... Gracias Jutta"

It was important for us to sleep well on the couch and bed, as well being able to navigate the city easily from the location.  Jutta's place exceeded my expectations.  I hope that I can stay there again when I visit NY.  Thank you Jutta for being so easy and pleasant to correspond with..... And for sharing a fun place to stay!"

Jutta was very easy to reach by phone or text message, and very accommodating. The apartment was clean, airy and bright. It's a great location, close to a big grocery store and the train, and the apartment faces the back so there is hardly any street noise. My Dad had an great stay and would stay at Jutta's again! "

The apartment is as described, clean and is located centrally in New York, also close to the subway. 

We stayed at Juttas place for a week, everything was perfect, and everything is near by. Its about ten minuttes walk to Empire State building.

The apartment floor sloped throughout the living room and towards the bathroom.  There is a pipe that sticks out of the wall where you take a shower.  I got scratch a couple of times while I was taking my shower.  The building is very old and stair very narrow.   ScaffoldIng in front of the building.  Very close to Penn Station.

8490,8259,25/8/09,32300,Gina,"Nathalie's brownstone truly is eden in the hood. What makes it even more special is that Nathalie is an easy going, friendly and welcoming host, who very much leaves you to it, but you can call on her any time for a chat or for help. 

The apartment is stunning and is beautifully decorated in an antique style, with every attention to detail. It it were a hotel, it would definitely be one of the best suites. The sunny terrace is a massive bonus, it's lovely to sit out there and have your morning coffee, while everything you might need has been thought of. It's a home from home.

The neighbourhood is great, real people, friendly and helpful. There's loads to check out nearby, further down Fulton Street. When I was here there was a great art fair, and Habana Outpost, with outdoor film screenings and frozen margaritas is a must. Manhatten is a 20 minute sub ride away, but Times Square will feel so fake after you've stayed here, I guarantee it. 

Would highly recommend Nathalie as a host and her brownstone as a place to stay in New York. I had a wonderful time. Thanks Nathalie. "
8490,16657,8/11/09,48839,J. Scott,"Our stay aw Maison Des Sirenes was enjoyable for its comfort, quietness and amenable layout. It fit our location needs for this visit with variety of amenities nearby (ie. groceries, nice wine store, subway. I would definitely return as a result and recommend it as well. On a star qualification I would rate it a 4 with a lot of value for the money."
8490,18626,29/11/09,46060,Kate,"Nathalie is a fantastic host!  She was available to give us advice and directions whenever we needed them.  Maison des Sirenes is beautiful.  It feels so much like home.  The apartment is decorated eclectically, and is very clean. The kitchen is well equipped.  Nathalie has also made restaurant and site seeing guides for her guests to use.  There are plenty of maps available too.  We used the bus map a lot! Williamsburg is not too far away, and has a neat vibe to it, with yummy food and fun shopping.  We ate at Bliss and stopped into a shop called Whisk, before we went to see a show at the BAM.  We also had an amazing dinner at an Italian restaurant only a few blocks away called Saraghina.  Nathalie recommended it to us, and we loved it!  I must be honest and share that I did have concerns about the neighborhood at first because my sister and I were the minority, which is a huge switch coming from white suburbia.  However, nobody bothered us, or even gave us a sideways glance.  I think our discomfort came from our own selves.  We ended up putting our concerns aside, and walked to dinner in the evening and had a great time.  I want to thank Nathalie for being so welcoming and hospitable.  We would love to come back!"
8490,20452,15/12/09,55566,Susana,"Nathalie's place is just amazing. We felt in lovewith it as soon as we saw the pics here, but what you find when you get there is even better. Nathalie is super nice and helpful if you need her but even when she lives downstairs you won't even notice her unless you search for her. The apartment is decorated just as seen in pics, but there are beautiful details that you only see once there, such as candles, cd player with relaxing music, everything you may need in kitchen and bathroom and a beautiful terrace that we'll defnetely come back to enjoy in summertime! The place is sooo charming and you can feel the good energy as soon as you go in, it's really like feeling at home!
The neighborhood is save and the subway is close. While staying there we had to take a few flights and the location is just perfect for reaching the airport (by bus, subway or taxi).
Thank you so much for everything Nathalie, it was a great experience and we'd definetely recommend your place to our friends."
8490,39836,3/5/10,111517,Jennifer,"I visited New York for a weekend with three friends and we were instantly smitten with Nathalie's gorgeous home. It's spacious (plenty of room for four people), convenient, and above all, replete with personality and character. Throughout the trip, my friends and I remarked countless times how glad we were to be staying at Nathalie's place in Brooklyn; not only did we get to see interesting neighbourhoods many tourists never experience, returning to Maison des Sirenes at the end of the day always felt like going home. There were thoughtful touches or details in every corner - a hairdryer and towels were provided, the kitchen was stocked with pots/pans/utensils, binders were stuffed with restaurant recommendations. The terrace was also marvelous - perfect for winding down at the end of a long day in the city.

Nathalie is a lovely host too. We were stuck in traffic while driving to NYC and arrived hours late -- at 3 a.m.! -- and Nathalie remained ever gracious and friendly, staying up to welcome us. I feel really lucky for finding Nathalie and her apartment and I would be more than happy to stay there on any return visits. I recommend it wholeheartedly - thank you so much Nathalie!
"
8490,48802,1/6/10,105648,Jocelyne,The apartment is warm and cosy. Travelling from there to Manhattan is very easy. Nathalie leaves recommandations and reviews to her guests. Really helpful!
8490,61598,6/7/10,104152,Johanna,Me and my friend Veronica stayed for a week in Nathalies lovely appartement! We had a perfect stay and Nathalie was helpful and kind. The terrace was lovely for a cold beer in the late summernight or for an early breakfast! I will absolutely recommend this appartement for my friends! Johanna 
8490,78220,14/8/10,151067,Maranda,"Amazing time...
Her place is so cute and has everything you need
Love the neighborhood will definitely go back next time I'm in NY..Saranghina the italien restaurant around the corner is amazing a real pearl in the hood..: ) I  loved everything about my stay at Natalie..."
8490,110959,4/10/10,184560,Nadene,"The apartment is beautiful.  Nathalie is kind and gracious.  The neighborhood is so amazing.  (My two girlfriends and I came to New York with no plans - just to relax.  Three 50 year old white women wandering around the neighborhood.)  We did not meet one person that was not friendly and welcoming. There are little stores and any kind of food you desire.  We took the subway to Manhattan (I definitely recommend the Carnegie Deli - split the order with someone!!)  It was so nice to come back to Maison Des Sirenes at the end of the day and relax.  The Italian Resturant in the next block is not to be missed (Website hidden by Airbnb) While this is not the normal ""bed and breakfast"" experience of having someone spoil you - I will recommend this place to everyone. What a wonderful adventure.  Thank you Nathalie!!  Dee, Linda and Julie"
8490,302719,7/6/11,32006,Stephane,"Nathalie apartment was so lovely! It was clean, beautiful and had all the necessities for a short stay, and we really enjoyed exploring Brooklyn and Manhattan and then coming ""home"" to a comfortable and airy place to relax, especially the terrace. It was easy to navigate the subways to her neighborhood, and the neighborhood felt very safe, even coming home late. Also It is important to mention, Nathalie is reliable and always available.

I highly recommend her apartment.

"
8490,316453,15/6/11,633882,Araba,"Nathalies apartment was beautiful and extremely clean. You can tell that she enjoys hosting visitors.   We enjoyed the roof terrace and were blessed with some lovely weather although with all of the things we wanted to do could not spend enough time there!  Nathalie is very helpful and has a lot of information on where to go and things to do in New York.  I would definitely return there.  Thank you Nathale for making our stay enjoyable. 
 "
8490,456780,18/8/11,953617,Thomas,"The overall experience at Nathalie's was a good one.  It was very spacious (enough for 3 beds), clean, and quite convenient to Manhattan.  Other pluses: she had binders full of good reading material about NYC, Direct TV with tons of channels including premium channels like HBO, and a great terrace to unwind from the day.  All of which would make me not hesitate to stay at her place again!  There were some minor issues though:  The bath tub (despite being clean) is a ""bend down and spray"" tub which made showering in the morning a bit annoying.  During the day, the area feels very safe but late at night it can be a bit dodgy.  We had a drunk guy follow us after we got out of the subway begging us to buy him a beer.  I suppose this could happen anywhere in NYC.  All in all, though I would rate my first airbnb experience a good one.  
Thanks Nathalie!!"
8490,524379,12/9/11,994376,Whitney,"The apartment was beautiful, spacious and comfortable. It was much more convienent than a hotel. We had one small issue with the toilet overflowing, but Nathalie was responsive and helpful. I appreciated the travel guides that Nathalie created. The neighborhood was welcoming, but a long walk from areas that we were interested in shopping and eating at. "
8490,625364,13/10/11,1013654,Louise,"I had such a lovely time in Nahalie's beautiful apartment, I was drawn to it from the beginning and was not disapointed. There was nothing that I was in need of that wasn't there, I even found a socket adapter.
If I were ever to return to New York, Nathalie would be my first contact."
8490,705218,9/11/11,1100161,Daniela,"First I liked the appartment a lot, second I liked Nathalie and her family a lot and third I liked the neighborhood very much, too. So what else is there still to say? ;-)
The bed has just the right tightness to provide a great sleep, the terrace has a cool urban vibe, the kitchen full of useful things, the decoration is romantic and shabby chic and I personally loved the speedy WIFI-connection - combined with the special atmosphere and nostalgic charme of the whole house it is a perfect place for a pleasant New York stay."
8490,973897,5/3/12,1782280,Claudine,"Habiter dans cet appartement fut une expérience beaucoup plus agréable que l'hôtel. Et que dire de l'endroit! Décoré avec finesse et goût, la maison des sirènes 1 est un lieu où il fait bon vivre... Nathalie est  à l'écoute des besoins de ses locataires et sait mettre les gens à l'aise par sa gentillesse. C'est un endroit que nous recommandons chaleureusement. Merci mille fois!

It has inspired me to work on my apartment!

A real home from home and very well organized in terms of keys etc.

Thank you!"
8490,1086868,5/4/12,1965337,Kitty,Enjoy our stay.   Very spacious for a family of 4.   We slept very well with the REAL bed !!!   Always nice to come back to Nathalie's place after a long day walking.    Also very convenient by metro to Chinatown.

It was very clean and the one we stayed in had a great enclosed terrace space with outdoor seating as well. The apartment is close to public transit also. This place is a great deal!

"
8490,1342683,24/5/12,2247540,Veronika,"Nathalie is an incredible host!   

Extremely nice, polite, cheerful and very very caring. When our friends asked my family how the trip went, my mum's first reaction was ""our host in NYC was charming"". 
 
The apartment was simply wonderful. Spacious, clean, neat, beautifully decorated and felt like home. I traveled with my parents and they are do not sleep well everywhere, but they said the beds were extra-comfortable.  
 
It is a short 5min walk to the nearest metro and you really get to downtown Manhattan in 20min. The neighborhood was safe too.  
 
One word can sum up our experience - PERFECT!!! Thank you Nathalie!

8490,1965253,13/8/12,1871031,Elisabeth,"La maison des sirènes est magnifique, aussi sinon encore plus belle que sur les photos. J'y ai bien dormi, apprécié l'air climatisée pendant cette chaleur estivale et découvert un quartier intéressant. La rue Lewis a plusieurs petits commerces vraiment chouettes. Le quartier est sécuritaire, nous étions deux femmes et peu importe l'heure à laquelle nous nous sommes promenées, il n'y avait aucun problème. Une belle fête de quartier a eu lieu le samedi 11 août mais dès 23h, tout était calme, les voisins sont respectueux!!! Nathalie est facilement joignable et très avenante, très gentille! Bref, c'est un bon choix que de réserver cet appartement :)"
8490,2775016,1/11/12,2440102,Yves,"Great location to explore NY. Very comfortable, cosy and well-equipped. Hurricane Sandy troubled our NY visit, but we were very lucky to have this place as our shelter for the storm. Host Nathalie did everything to help us and make it comfortable. Many thanks."
8490,2888535,15/11/12,2185401,Karol,"The apartment is very charming, lovely decorated and the neighborhood safe and quite, except for few times when ambulances would go by.
Nathalie was very helpful and accepted us, both families with children. We didn't have a problem at all going in and out at wee hours of the night.

8490,4683119,20/5/13,2666976,Jason,"Nathalie made sure we had a wonderful stay in her apartment.  It was very well decorated, very clean and had everything we could ask for during our brief stay.  I could tell she put a good amount of effort into setting up the apartment to be both visually appealing and functional for her guests.

Nathalie provided very detailed instructions on how to travel to and access the apartment and gave several good recommendations for local places to shop and eat.  

 The apartment was just a short 10 minute walk from the subway station and we came and went even late into the night with no worries or issues.  

I highly recommend staying with Nathalie if you get a chance.  Her excellent reviews on AirBNB are well earned."
8490,5351769,25/6/13,2832484,Beth,"The apartment was very spacious, with high ceilings and room to relax after a busy day in the city. The twin daybeds were quite comfortable even for one person in our party who has a bad back, The A/C was great, only a window unit but kept the entire apartment nice and cool. My in-laws very much enjoyed their mornings on the patio. The neighborhood was also great. I felt safe even as our group was returning after dark. There was plenty of street parking nearby."
8490,7593570,25/9/13,523603,Eve,"Natalie was a lovely host, easy to work with and has everything set up for easy check in and check out.  The pictures on the website do not do her apartment justice.  It is decorated quite nicely and is very comfortable and large and clean.  Parking was also relatively easy, which was a plus. It is a great value and we had an excellent stay there!"

Situé, dans une rue calme et pleine de charme de Brooklyn, l'appartement se trouve à 5 minutes à pied du métro, permettant de se projeter rapidement à Manhattan. Il est magnifiquement décoré et l'on y est tellement bien.
J'espère avoir l'occasion d'y retourner.

Nathalie's apartment is 5 star!  I loved the beds, the decor, the east  coast woodwork.  The cool patio in back.  Tub and shower were great.  I met Nathalie, and she was superb. Look no further this is the spot.  
Its close to the train.  Never felt unsafe.  And of course, its NY, so you can find some really good food in walking distance.  "
8490,23763037,9/12/14,3519680,Francoise,"Nathalie was very welcoming and communicated very well and promptly.  She left us very clear instructions on everything about the apartment and was very gracious.  The place was absolutely wonderful, clean, charming, and very beautiful in its historic details,  furnishings and international decor.  We felt warm and cozy on the rainy cold days we stayed there in December.  Our elderly mother was very comfortable and it meant so much to her to have a place where her family could gather.  The kitchen was well stocked with everything needed.  The light and layout of the apartment was excellent, and the backyard upper deck was beautiful and private feeling, like the rest of the apartment.  We would have enjoyed using it had the weather been better.  The pictures show the place very well, but the details of the two fireplace mantel pieces, the old plaster moldings, the wood work and chandeliers were wonderful to see. All in all, a great place for us to land for our family gathering in a perfect neighborhood.  We are very grateful, Nathalie!

There was lots of room for the three of us friends, especially when Nathalie made an extra effort to make sure our tall friend had a double bed. The patio is a lovely addition. The neighbourhood is a bit ""up and coming,"" but we had zero issues there and completely enjoyed our stay. I recommend the little organic food shop on the corner of Throop and Halsey, I believe it was. Make sure to check out Brunswick cafe on Marcus Garvey Blvd for coffee or brunch! "

Das Viertel ist sehr in Ordnung und noch nicht wirklich gentrifiziert aber keinesfalls gefährlich. Man bekommt einen guten Eindruck vom ursprünglichen Brooklyn. Wir waren mit zwei Kindern (11 und 13) da und hatten großen Spaß in dieser aufregenden Stadt. Die Kommunikation mit Nathalie hat von Beginn an wunderbar geklappt. 100% Empfehlung."

9357,17583,17/11/09,43997,Wayne,Very convenient location for the price. Would benefit from getting a small table and coffee pot to be able to have breakfast before leaving to explore NY! Thank you Laurelle for allowing us to stay at your place. I hope you didn't get too wet from camping! H & W
9357,23074,4/1/10,40822,Niall,"We stayed for a week at New Years Eve and really enjoyed Laurelle's place. Very centrally located, nice and warm with a really good shower (very important). Laurelle was a very nice host. Would gladly stay again."
9357,37490,23/4/10,111485,Ethan,Stayed at Laurelle's for a few nights and loved walking around to Central Park and close attractions. Got some serious touristing done because of the location. Would definitely repeat!
9357,39144,1/5/10,106500,Andrew,"Was quite happy with my visit. The price was good, the location was about perfect. No surprises, and Laurelle was great to deal with."
9357,40816,8/5/10,103177,Estelle,"This review is 6 months late but I'm still glad to come back to AirBnB. My boyfriend and I stayed here in May 2010, during the week of the Times Square foiled bombs. Although we never met Laurelle (she was out of town), this was a fantastic pad for a week's visit. I'd lived in Manhattan for 4 years previously and never knew how awesome the Hell's Kitchen district was. Solid affordable accommodation in Manhattan. :)"
9357,50068,5/6/10,127645,Rakhi,Very Cute apt. Laurelle was very responsive and easy to deal with. Great location and clean what more can you ask for?

9357,72433,1/8/10,21452,Kevin & Monet,"Staying at Laurelle's apartment was a real treat! It is conveniently placed and walking distance from several restaurants, theaters, bars and subway stops. When we weren't out exploring the city, we were comfortable and entertained in Laurelle's apartment with access to a computer and television. Thanks, Laurelle!"
9357,76381,9/8/10,177816,Marc,"We couldn't have asked for a better apartment, location, or hostess! This place is a wonderful little studio with so much character right in the heart of the city. Laurelle was always available to answer questions. Fantastic overall experience and highly recommended!"
9357,80217,17/8/10,180855,Chiara,Good location.Laurelle is very kind and the apartment is near to all New York attractions. We only had some problem with some beattles in the bathroom and in the kitchen. I think is a New York old problem. She told us she's going to extermite them.
9357,84018,24/8/10,185432,Linzi,"What a fantastic location! Very short walk to Central Park and Times Square and near a subway station and Whole Foods store. Laurelle was very welcoming and the apartment was clean and tidy for us. We were also able to leave our bags during our last day and return later to collect them, which was a big help. The neighbourhood was very safe and for first time New York visitors it was a great place for us to be very inexpensively. "
9357,91092,6/9/10,186152,Julie,"
My boyfriend and I stayed at Laurelle's place from Sept 1st to Sept 5th and it was absolutely Perfect!! Great location, great apartment, great host! It was just a couple of blocks from Central Park and Time square without being too crowded or loud. Subway lines are very close too! We were so pleased with everything. Thank you so much Laurelle for making this trip a fantastic one!! "
9357,128966,28/10/10,245860,Marla,"We stayed 5 nights at Laurelle's place and it was great.  Easy and flexible check in and out, plus access to her computer! The flat is central and quiet, a nice addition is hearing the clip clop of horse/carriages driving by.  "
9357,156428,20/12/10,317991,Sharon,We stayed at Laurelle's place for one night on 12/18/10. She was a gracious host and thankfully didn't mind that traffic put us over an hour late to check-in! The apartment was clean and inviting and the location can't be beat. We had a fabulous stay and would definitely stay at Laurelle's again. 
9357,164294,3/1/11,317951,Julian,"We stayed with Laurelle for New Years Eve weekend, and it was a wonderful visit.  Her apartment was walking distance from good restaurants and she was really helpful in giving recommendations.  Her apartment was eccentric and quite a relaxing place to be.   We will stay there again the next time we return to the city.

The building is quiet and the doorman was very helpful and sweet! The apartment is close to the subway and walking distance from several bars and restaurants in the area. I highly recommend it!
9357,279316,24/5/11,551381,Kyrre,"Perfect location close to the subway, Central Park, great restaurants and delis. So as a base to discover Manhattan it's absolutely spot on. The apartment itself is as described, located in a relatively calm street away from the crowds and a positive plus was quiet neighbours in the building. Laurelle was a great host, both in communicating before, during and after the stay, Couldn't be better!"
9357,290752,31/5/11,300493,Zcx,"This place was as nice as described on the website. We loved it and we would stay there again: great location, the place was quiet, welcoming and very clean. The bed was good and the shower very nice. Laurelle was very helpful and nice. We loved it!
We highly recommend this place!!"
9357,339860,28/6/11,505527,Emiliano,"Laurelle's studio is charming, cozy and perfect for two people. Located in a very nice area of Manhattan, with a comfy bed and good shower.   

We felt like locals and had a really cool experience.  It is close to lot's of nice restaurants, bars and delis.  Walking distance from Central Park, Times Square and all major metro lines.  There is a doorman, elevator and it is very well equiped.

It could be a bit more organized and clean. I also suggest  to make some more space to leave gest's personal luggage.  Apart from that the place is perfect!

"
9357,351147,4/7/11,534347,Emma,We stayed in Laurelle's apartment for 5 nights in July 2011.  The apartment is exactly as shown in the photos.  It is situated in a very good location and within easy walking distance of Central Park and Time Square.  There are also some very good restaurants in the area.  Laurelle was a very good host and recommended things for us to see and do in the area.  I would definitely stay here again.
9357,450538,16/8/11,825186,SZhen,Great Location!!!
9357,469295,23/8/11,825321,Claire,"We stayed here for a week and really enjoyed the central location.  Times Square, Central Park, subways, supermarkets and hell's kitchen restaurants were all easy walking distance.  Tommi was super helpful with directions from the airport which made connections much easier.  The apartment is surprisingly quiet given the busy city is right there.  Using the laundry facilities in the building was also handy towards the end of our stay.  We also used the computer at the apartment for getting on the internet to book things and check out things to do.  The photos are exactly what you can expect, it's not a huge place but doesn't claim to be, it's still muh better than a hotel at a similar price!"
9357,508361,6/9/11,1017437,Mike,great place
9357,554951,21/9/11,836916,Daniel,"Quiet, safe, comfortable, charming.  Superb location.  Great value.  Laurelle was a kind and considerate host, and great with communication.  The Midtown Pied-a-terre will be at the top of my list when I visit the area again."
9357,877190,23/1/12,876448,Bec,"Love, love, loved it! Brilliant location, beautiful apartment, lovely host. Not a bad word. Hot powerful shower. Comfy bed (if your under 6ft 4 and not a big sook). Close to delicious food- both restaurants and markets. Super close to great shows and times square! Will def stay here again on next visit. Thanks! "

9357,2257014,10/9/12,3441464,Gaurav,"Tommi's place was clean (smelled of cinnamon) and set up to accommodate our needs perfectly. We needed an extra bed which Tommi helpfully set up for us in advance. She also left little post-its for us that explained everything we needed to know - the locations of tucked away power outlets, where the kitchen utensils were etc. 

She was also a great communicator - replying to emails quickly as well as keeping in touch via SMS to make sure we were settled in OK.

I would definitely consider staying here again."
9357,3005289,1/12/12,47410,Robert,"Wow, was so nice I enjoyed my stay so well I hardly knew I was there !! Went by much too fast !! 
Thanks Tommi"
9357,3566431,18/2/13,1696264,Raíssa,"Tommi's apartment is just as described. Perfect location - grocerys, restaurants, fast foods, pharmacys, closest subway 2 blocks away, central park just 5 blocks - everything you need by walking distance. It has a confortable bed (but taller people may have problems), a nice kitchen (doesnt have a microwave) and a bathroom (with a body mirror!) 

Tommi is the most wonderful host, always helping when needed (when we didn't know how to use the tv, or to close the windows), she let us use the apt telephone to make local calls and even though she wasnt in town she send a friend to deliver the keys and was always there to assist us.

The things I wasn't very glad about was the lightning, witch are very poor, even if you turn on all the lights and the bathroom curtains witch doesnt close very well and overflows the bathroom. 
Also, the tv is old and it's kind of difficult to deal with it, but you won't go to NYC to watch tv so thats fine. Other than that, great stay and would definatelly book again. "
9357,4081362,8/4/13,5457354,María Dolores,Excelente ubicación. Muy amable el trato con Tommi. El apartamento es acogedor y cálido.
9357,5325827,24/6/13,6674197,Zebulun,"We had a great stay at the apartment. Location was absolutely fantastic, literally walk out the door and you're in Central Park and a short walk gets you to the heart of time square. Apartment itself was great, warm and cost and had all the amenities we could have asked for. The host was also extremely helpful and very easy to get along with."
9357,6093548,29/7/13,7659748,Martin,"Tommi's place is nice and cozy, and perfectly located for the main touristy area as well as some nice bars and restos in Hell's Kitchen area. Communications with Tommi were always timely, and friendly.  I recommend the place for a couple more than for friends."
9357,7378934,17/9/13,6370363,Andrea,"Our time at Tomis apartment was great! The apartment is just like the pictures, there is even a full mirror, which was great!

9357,7427415,19/9/13,617483,Evan,This studio flat in Midtown was a great location and cozy and comfy.  And Tommi was super helpful about seeing to our needs!  Had a great time.

We hope to stay again:)

9357,8071062,14/10/13,9210892,Matthew,WOW!  What a great stay.  Perfect location.  Happy to see there was an Elevator.  Parking Garage on the same street.  Tommi was very nice and accommodating.  the space was comfortable and perfect.  Plenty to do within walking distance.  If you are looking for a place in Midtown.  Stop looking.  This is the place.  
9357,48126059,23/9/15,35180191,Nitin,Personification of great hospitality. Came to my rescue twice when i had no place to stay. Excellent communication. A cozy apartment near an amazing location. Everything in a walking distance. Tommi has been very professional in detailing out everything that one needs during a short stay. Love the apartment!
9357,51310455,19/10/15,14999600,Monika,"We were very happy with the location which was absolutely perfect! I also very appreciate the responsible and reliable attitude of Tommi, who responded us always immediately and was very helpful with everything. The cooperation and personal attitude was 100% satisfaction."
9357,58051304,31/12/15,3674848,Kerrie,"Tommi (Laurelle) was very helpful and informative and answered any communication very quickly.  Her apartment is in a great location, with lots of nice bars and restaurants close by and not far from Times Square and Broadway.  There are no stairs to enter the building and there is a lift, so perfect if stairs are a problem.  The apartment is small but works well for one or two people.  There are a lot of personal belongings in and on every surface in the apartment and a completely full fridge so very little room for hanging clothes or storing food, and no microwave.  The TV is old and must be turned on and off via a switch on the TV. Laurelle was very kind and helpful, a lovely host."
9357,58908770,5/1/16,43660133,Miguel,"This place was great, perfect distance from everything. Plenty of restaurants and stores around within walking distance.

Estaba en el piso para recibirnos, a pesar de que el avión llegó con retraso y me escribió durante la estancia para asegurarse de que todo estaba bien. El apartamento está bien situado y dispone de todo lo detallado en el anuncio. La cama es cómoda y la ducha funciona bien. Sin embargo, las sábanas tenían manchas y agujeros, la cortina de la ducha presentaba moho y, en general, el piso no estaba tan limpio como nos hubiera gustado."
9357,102913474,19/9/16,25231559,Maxime,"Appartement très bien placé entre central park et time square. à 3 minutes à pied du métro. Tommi est vraiment très gentille et nous a très bien accueilli. Le logement est très sympa, il manque juste une table et une armoire pour mettre ses vêtements. Mais lors d'un séjour à New-York on est plus dans la rue qu'enfermé dans un appartement :)"
9357,104444267,26/9/16,23624803,Clarkie Marie,This apartment was super cute and in the perfect location! There was a doorman and elevator too which was a plus. I would recommend this place to anyone.
9357,107963738,13/10/16,54365763,Dan,"The location was great and Tommi was very helpful and accomdating. The apartment is a bit small and crowded, so there was not a lot of place for personal belongings. Also, there is a strong smell of incense and aromatic oils in the apartment, which can be problematic for people with allergies."
9357,110801259,28/10/16,1848028,Michael,"Tommi  (Laurelle) was a great host. Nice, helpful and answering any questions very fast.
The apartment was in a great and safe location close to Times Square, Broadway, Central Park and Metro Stations. Nice Bakeries, Restaurants, Bars, small Supermarkets were very close.
The apartment is small and as shown on the pics.  A bit crowded, so not a lot of space for our belongings.  but ok for 1 week.
Laurelle, thank you. You were a lovely host."

Safe neighborhood and walking distance to restaurants, CVS, Central Park, coffee shops, etc. Also close to transit entrances, so we never had to take an Uber or cab! Loved the vibe of this unique little apartment. Laurelle greeted us upon check in to exchange keys and share recommendations for places nearby. Overall, we had a positive experience during our weekend stay!"
9357,157738943,4/6/17,56603454,Amber,"This apt. has a really groovy, funky decor and vibe - tons of character - I loved it!  I felt very comfortable there. It's small but not at all cramped. Laurelle (Tommi) was super responsive and a good communicator, and very friendly and welcoming. All the info was clear and there were no surprises with her place. The building is safe and I felt very comfortable staying there as a single female. The building itself is on a quiet residential block, but the street one block away is chock full of restaurants, bars, cafes, diners, grocery stores, drug stores, etc. A great location convenient to all that Midtown has to offer. Enjoyed my stay very much!"

Tiziana"
9657,13225931,22/5/14,4147416,Sean,"I have to say this is a tough review to write, because I know that by giving such a glowing review it decreases my chances of seeing Dana's place available again!  Dana was a fantastic host from start to finish - communication and check in was seamless.  Her place is ideal if you like the neighborhood, which I do, and don't mind the 4 floor walkup, which I appreciate.  I would highly recommend Dana's place, and hope I get to stay there in my future travels to New York."
9657,13928480,8/6/14,13760119,Rebekah,Beautiful apartment and great location. Perfect for exploring the East Village and neighbouring area. Dana was very accommodating with the dates. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay although too short!
9657,20505302,30/9/14,19276742,Kjell Ake,"Me and my son had a very great stay in Dana's apartment in late Sept 2014. It was exactly as described in her presentation and all worked out perfectly. A comfortable double-bed plus a broad couch gave us good sleep. Although we have the windows open during the nights it was very quiet and safe.
East Village is nice and perfect starting point for discover the rest of Manhattan, and the near surroundings is something to explore with small shops, bars, restaurants etc. 
Dana was perfect in her communication all the time, answered rapidly and helped us when we needed it, despite we never met her in person. 
If one need a two small room apartment in a quiet part of the town, we can highly recommend Dana's place. It's not overwhelming luxury, but you feel that you are in one's personal, nice furnitured (mostly from the 50-60th decades) home. A really good choice! Thanks for a wonderful week - even the weather was perfect!"
9657,23604383,6/12/14,22791443,Hermione,"We had a fantastic stay at Dana's lovely apartment.  It was really warm (which was great as it was freezing outside!), clean and spacious for two people.  Dana was really great at keeping in touch with us and was there to meet us when we arrived from the airport.  The flat is really well located in the East Village near lots of restaurants, shops and cafes and only a short 8 min walk to Union Square which has lots of metro stops and a big Whole Foods - bonus!"
9657,42451298,13/8/15,12119316,Mercedes,"Dana is a wonderful host. Very accommodating and helpful, providing an extensive ""house manual"" with answers to every question. She is also readily available by phone or text for advice and recommendations. The neighborhood is so convenient and perfect for a NYC East Village experience. Prospective renters should know that this a fourth floor walk-up apartment. Thanks, Dana--I hope to be back soon!"
9657,48149285,23/9/15,7187414,Rob,"Dana's apartment is wonderful.  Great location, beautiful furniture, and good amenities.  The internet speed is ridiculously fast!  Dana is quick to respond to requests - other AirBnBers could learn from her."
9657,49037306,30/9/15,43280972,Elissa,"Dana was an extremely gracious and responsive host, and went out of her way to make us feel welcome.  Her residence is as described, fully appointed and comfortable, and in the heart of Manhatten with ready access to all amenities and transportation.  It is perfect for a jaunt to NYC. "
9657,51470754,20/10/15,37412,Gary,Dana was quick to respond to emails and made the entire process smooth and easy.  The apartment is ideally located in East Village and is very quiet - especially at night.  The bed is comfortable and the apartment very functional.   I won't hesitate to book again if it's available.  
9657,53614153,10/11/15,2074362,Dean,"Dana was great to deal with. Prompt, friendly, and willing to go out of her way to make my stay in NYC great.

I stayed in her lovely and homey East Village apartment for two weeks. It was warm, quiet, with basically no neighbourhood noise at all (very rare), had a comfortable bed, a nice huge desk, a functional kitchen, and an old but very decent bathroom (especially for NYC!). The apartment is on the fourth floor - as other reviewed have noted - but is probably a good thing for those indulging themselves and needing to burn off some extra calories. The foyer is a bit dark and uninviting - especially to those who have not been in many NYC apartments - but this is standard and just the style of the original building.

The neighbourhood is vibrant and buzzing with things to see and do. A number of Momofuku eateries are barely a block away, as is a cinema, a couple of markets, coffee shops, bagel joints, Japanese restaurants, and just about anything else you could want. Most metro connections are only a short walk away and so it is trivial to get whenever you need to go.

I would happily stay with Dana again when I need a comfortable base to visit NYC."
9657,55971274,7/12/15,6294436,Richard,"A great place in cool neighborhood. The apartment was as described and Dana was very responsive and a pleasure to deal with. There is no higher recommendation than saying that I'd definitely stay there again next time I'm in NYC if it is available. 
"
9657,70573606,18/4/16,40115427,Audrey,"Great apartment in an awesome location. Plenty of room for my husband and I, and even enough space to comfortably put up our niece for a couple of nights when she came in from Brooklyn. Great decor and book collection. We arrived a little earlier than expected, but Dana was very gracious in accommodating us."
9657,75116059,19/5/16,71331478,Julien,"Dana's place is the first one I've ever booked with Airbnb. She was helpful and easy to reach during the booking process, and gave simple and clear instructions for the stay.

The apartment is in a great neighborhood, feels very homey and is pretty quiet (which is always appreciated, even surprising, in New York). Overall it fits the given description.

In a word, would definitely book again."
9657,106160759,4/10/16,2019559,Suzette,"Dana is a great host, very communicative and helpful. We weren't able to access the internet when we first arrived and she literally dropped everything she was doing at that moment to solve the problem, fixing the issue in five minutes or less. Great spot in the East Village w/ mid-century modern decor (and yes, very quiet!) - good size for a NYC one-bdroom. The neighborhood has managed to preserve some of its authenticity, void of tourists and modern condos. Hundreds of restaurants, bars and little shops. If you want to feel removed from much hassle and bustle, but with lots to do and explore, this is the neighborhood."
9657,107661424,11/10/16,5080585,Sean & Kara,"Dana's place was great! Creative and ""homey"" (because it's literally a designer's apartment), we found it very easy to unwind while there, get gear up for some real New York adventures. Her place felt like an extension of the amazing city we explored. 

Dana was easy to communicate with, laid back, and very accommodating. All of our dialogue was online, but we never felt like we couldn't reach out if we had a question. 

The neighbors were surprisingly quiet, which especially helpful at night. A little bit of street noise, but SO minimal to even a few blocks away. 

Note: up 4 flights of stairs. No problem for us, but just something to prepare for if you have heavy luggage, a child, or are unable to hoof it up to the 4th floor. 

Overall, great experience. Thank you Dana! You rock. "
9657,112554047,6/11/16,10958216,Yos,"Great, spacios 1 bedroom that has everything one needs in one of my favourite NYC locations. 
The place is clean, quiet and comfortable - the only thing I woul note is the walk-up to the 4th floor. That said, I would stay there again next time I hope. Thanks Dana!"
9657,138791264,21/3/17,6997556,Ximo,El apartamento de Dana es muy cómodo para pasar unos días en New York. Nos facilitó en todo momento la llegada y es muy amable. El apartamento tiene de todo lo que se necesita para estar cómodo.

9657,266232337,19/5/18,3002879,Jennifer,"We had such a lovely stay at Dana’s place! It was exactly as pictured but had so much more to offer. It was warm and cozy but gave us the much needed space we required as we were travelling with a toddler. Dana was so receptive and easy to contact. I would definitely recommend her place to anyone, it’s the perfect home away from home."
9668,12371,4/10/09,37747,Joachim,"Ssameer is a very polite and uncomplicated person. He is a real foodie :-) and can provide you with many of information about any kind of restaurant you are looking for. I stayed for 15 days in his apartment. It is clean, cosy, quite and it has everything you need incl. wifi. Public transportations are just around the corner and it takes about 20-30 minutes to be in the middle of action in NY. 30$ for the private room is really worth it and in addition it has a very comfy mattress. I enjoyed my stay at this place and can absolutely recommend it!"
9668,13409,12/10/09,43336,Carrie,nice host. honest and easy going. would board with again.
9668,18360,26/11/09,53940,David,"Liked Saameer's place very much. Stayed there with my wife for 4 nights. Communication with Saameer is easy, answers phone and emails promptly. He was very polite and friendly. Never bothered us one bit. Was never annoyed at all my inquiries....just chill. The other rommie was also chill as hell. Everyone was quiet and I slept like a fricking baby.

Location is super convenient. Just take the 1 train 1 block away and eat at innexpensive Dominican dinners uptown for cheap and tasty food. This area near City college is gentrifying like (Website hidden by Airbnb) unrcognizable from when I used to live in nYC 2 years ago. The area is safe and friendly as hell.

If you need an affordable place to stay and enjoy NYC, go to Saameer's.

Cheers...and thanks you again Saameer."
9668,18688,29/11/09,49036,Michael,"Ssameer is friendly, courteous and accommodating. The apt is extremely warm, but that's just steam heat in an apt bldg. The beds are serviceable, and the bathroom is clean. Shower has plenty of hot water. We were also comfortable in the neighborhood, and as advertised, the subway entrance is a short 1-1/2 blocks away @ Hamilton Place and Broadway. We would recommend this apt, especially for people under 40. My age group may require more padding on the mattress. :) A bargain for Manhattan, no question."
9668,20424,15/12/09,49142,Ellen,"If you are looking for mints on your pillow and cheesy tourist attractions, stay at the Marriott in Times Square. If you want a clean, secure room in a laid-back environment, and possibly to get to know some real New Yorkers, stay with Sameer! The apartment is super-convenient and includes all the basics (kitchen access, clean shared bathroom, linens/towels, WiFi). The neighborhood is a very diverse, mostly residential one with great cheap restaurants and everything else you need. And Sameer himself is the ideal host/roommate-- helpful without being nosy or pushy, easy to make arrangements with, etc. This is the best deal in town! "
9668,20942,20/12/09,28515,Alexis,"Ssameer was a delight to be around and made the process very easy. The room was clean, basic and comfortable and I'd gladly stay there again or recommend the space to others. Best value in the city, and a neat neighborhood, too. Be sure to check out the Riverbank park while you're there, as well as the great, cheap, eateries on Broadway."
9668,21196,23/12/09,53378,Manon,Ssameer is easy going and really cool. The room is little but it wasn't a surprise.We loved the neighborhood and there is something pleasant about the apartment. Perfect for a short cheap stay in NYC.
9668,25700,8/2/10,59167,Heart-Of-Gold (Syds),"Ssameer, has a good heart, friendly and willing to tell you all you need to know about NYC.
APT: Clean,private,internet connection 24/7. 
Close to subway, easy access to all basics.
I felt at home at ssameers home, highly recommended.
See you soon ssameer (bru)"
9668,26490,16/2/10,69008,Jerry,"I could talk about the comfortable apartment and its location in a good quiet neighborhood easily accessible to the subway, or I could talk about how it's probably the best bargain in Manhattan.  But the best thing you'll get from this deal is your new friend Ssameer.  He made me feel welcome right from the start and he was extremely helpful in so many ways.  When I forgot to pack my computer power cord he got online and hooked me up with a new one.  I also forgot my phone charger so he charged it up for me whenever I needed it.  We even took a trip out to Long Island to his favorite Cajun restaurant to get my opinion on it (it was great!).  The best part was probably just sitting around talking with him.  He's a great conversationalist and seems to be able to talk about any subject.  After a week I feel like I can really call him a friend.  He'll be seeing me again!"
9668,30288,20/3/10,68845,Jun,"Sameer's place is strategically located near the subway station, with  access to the NYC's main attractions in less than 30 minutes - for first timers here, this really helped us a lot! He keeps his place clean & everything was in order, from clean towels to kitchen amenities, we really had no complaints ! The place is warm too - just nice for us who just came from a hot & humid country & can't really bear the cold! He lets us have our own space & time too, plus, as it's within college area, we felt safe walking around :) - at this price, I would recommend this to anyone!"
9668,32850,2/4/10,97158,Julie-Anne,"central. la propreté laisse un peu à désirer mais pour le prix, on va pas rechigner... Et Ssameer est très sympa!"

9668,37614,24/4/10,77135,Robert,"The location can't be beat. I stayed only one night, but I found Ssameer to be a good host -- accommodating and friendly. The bed in the room I stayed in is not very soft, but I didn't have a problem sleeping. (Light sleepers ought to be aware, though.) Overall, a great experience, and I would definitely come back. "
9668,37698,24/4/10,110508,Rochelle,"This is a highly recommended place to stay!  Ssameer is a fabulous host.  He was flexible about when we arrived, chatted with us and made sure we had everything we needed.  Very close to subway.   Although the room is small, it is clean and lots of luggage fits in the closet leaving plenty of space.  Thanks, Ssameer!"
9668,38082,26/4/10,64450,Lara,"I can only recommend a stay at Ssameer's. He is a very nice, polite and considerate host and will give u tips about great places to eat or to visit and he always tries to be helpful. The provided room was small (though for one person it's perfectly fine) but clean (and w/ clean I mean European standards clean, not American - which is hard to find in NYC for that affordable price, believe me), quite quiet and even had a small closet in it - and u also get your own set of keys for the apartment. For NYC the neighbourhood is ok and the subway station is only 2 minutes away from Ssameer's place. In 15 - 20 minutes u can be in Midtown Manhattan (Penn Station). I was travelling alone and really felt safe at Ssameer's place. For this price you will find no better and cheaper place near Midtown to stay at than Ssameer's."
9668,38644,28/4/10,94610,Keller,"Ssameer's the bomb...period! If you don't have a great experience staying with him then it's on you.  He's helpful, neat, smart, funny and an over all good individual.  I'm gonna miss him!  Muah xoxo "
9668,46736,27/5/10,101506,Oli,"Me and my boyfriend enjoyed the stay at Ssameer's place. However the room was pretty tiny and I can hardly imagine staying there during the summer. We lacked the fresh air a bit. The place was quite busy as there were 5 people (including us) at one moment and only one bathroom. This flat is very well located indeed and also Ssameer is very nice person thus for backpackers or those who don't want to spent their fortune on accommodation in NYC it's worth it. Thank you Ssameer, Oli@Gasper"
9668,55048,20/6/10,110502,Igor,"Nicest little place in a quiet (as quiet as it may be in the center of Harlem) neighborhood. Friendly, obliging host. 
We absolutely loved our stay here and hope to stay here again on our next visit to NYC.

9668,58548,28/6/10,84544,Xx,"had a good stay at Ssameer, perfect location, very close to the subway! perfect to visit nyc for the budget traveller!!!"
9668,60080,2/7/10,151554,Jacek,Ssameer is one righteous dude. If you don't get along with him there's something wrong with you. 
9668,62314,8/7/10,104247,Alina,"my friend and I stayed at ssameers place for 5 nights and really enjoyed his apartment. even tough he told us that the room might be a little small for 2 people it was just fine. there is a fan in the room and when you leave the door open at night the A/C also cools down the room a bit (as it was raelly hot and humid at that time in ny - around 100F)

the location is ok, but not really downtown - to times square probably 25 min by metro. but it seams to be quite safe and the subway and a supermarket are just around the corner.

unfortunately we did not even see ssameer even once, as we really had bad timing - anyway - thanks for everything sam, we loved our stay at your apartment!!

also the very funny coincidence that there were 2 other very nice ""girls"" ;) from our hometown at ssameers place when we were there was really nice!- hope you had a nice time after we left laura and isabella - it was very nice meeting you! and thanks again for everything :)

"
9668,65440,17/7/10,113717,John,"Sameer's a cool guy.  I was delayed making my way into Manhattan from Jersey and therefore late for our first meeting where I was supposed to get the keys.  He was very understanding and helpful in getting me on the right train.  If you have questions about the city or neighborhood or need recommendations on things to do or see in NYC he's happy to offer guidance.  He's a chill character that's into music, and overall really easy to get along with.     

"
9668,68208,24/7/10,134578,Louis,Ssameer is such a wonderful person to talk to! Though the room is a bit small but his heart is big enough to encompass all of us! :)
9668,68830,25/7/10,162206,Peter,"Ssameer war erste Klasse! Netter kann man Fremden nicht zeigen, willkommen zu sein. Das Zimmer, die Wohnung, war bestens vorbereitet und bot alles, was man für eine erholsame Nacht und einen guten Start in den neuen Tag benötigt. Inklusive einem guten Glas Wein am Abend und anregenden Tips für NY. Sehr zu empfehlen!"
9668,71561,31/7/10,166355,Xuezhou,"Ssameer is awesome! He prepared us a sweet nice little private room to stay in, with clean sheets and bath towels, I would highly recommend him if you want to ever stay over night in the city. Thank you very much!"

9668,81517,20/8/10,90810,Joaquín,"Muy buena opción (¡y de las más baratas!) para viajar a Nueva York. El apartamento está al lado del metro en una zona muy tranquila y bien comunicado. Ssameer es un anfitrión genial, y te ayudará a encontrar lo que buscas en la ciudad si quieres salir de los recorridos más turísticos. ¡Saludos desde Cádiz, Ssameer! Pese a pasar allí buena parte de agosto, en casa no hacía nada de calor (aire acondicionado y/o ventiladores) y puedes disponer de toallas y sábanas, cosa que aligera el equipaje. ¡Muy recomendable!"
9668,83311,23/8/10,179322,Peggy,We stayed at Ssameer's for three nights and it was great. Very clean and Ssameer was very kind and very helpful. Cant beat the price.
9668,90981,6/9/10,134563,Konstantin,"We had 5 days in Ssameer's apartment in early September 2010. Unfortunately he was away this time, but he was agree to provide a room for us.

The flat was not clean, because, I think, someone else was here before us.
We had a little problems with flushing of the toilet and draining the shower. In our first evening we could not open the flat's door and it was not funny. After dozen attempts it suddenly opened.

Room is small, just for sleeping, and the flat is very simple and crammed. 
As everybody says, location is very good- close to subway station. We easily can get to the centre of Manhattan.

It was not an aim to write a bad review, I just want to provide true information. 
It's a good place for staying in New York for this price. 
Anyway, thanks Ssameer!"

9668,106597,27/9/10,233614,Yinka,Ssameer was heaven sent. He is the nicest person I've ever meet. Very hospitable. He made me feel like I was his little sister coming to visit from out of town. He made sure I was taken care of by asking if I was okay and did I need anything. I enjoyed every moment especially when we finally had the chance to chat and get to know each other. HE'S AWESOME!!!!

9668,157785,24/12/10,124714,Sarah,"I had the honor to be roommates with Ssameer for almost 2 months and I can only say: if you stay with him, you are the luckiest traveler in New York. His apartment is clean (no bugs at all!), cozy and he makes sure you feel welcome. It's almost like a hotel: he provides you with towels, his shampoo selection is huge (due to all of his guests leaving them behind), his hospitality is amazing. He is able to recommend the best restaurants in every single part of the city, and if you want to make him happy share some good wine and cheese with him. 

The only negative thing I could mention are the neighbors above - they sometimes tapdance in the middle of the night, or so it seems from that thumping upstairs. Everything else was so great, I was really sad to leave him. Man - I miss him already, and I just left his apartment yesterday!"
9668,159640,28/12/10,110508,Rochelle,"This was another great stay at Ssameer's.  He was very accommodating of me arriving later than expected on Christmas Eve.  Even though it was stormy outside it was still warm and inviting at Ssameer's place.  Some great neighbors even helped me shovel out my Jeep after the huge storm so I could get back on the road.  Thanks, Ssameer!"
9668,164484,3/1/11,324378,Ryan,Great host! Seemed to go out of his way to make my stay enjoyable. Would definitely stay with Ssameer again! 
9668,169783,12/1/11,317482,Jose-Carlos,I would totally recommend staying at Ssameer's rental. The room itself is small but great for one person and great if you are visiting NYC and not planning on spending a lot of time indoors. Ssameer and his girlfriend were both very friendly and hospitable enough to advise me of the local NYC happenings.  The location was excellent as you really are only footsteps away for the subway and in a safe highly populated area.  
9668,174780,25/1/11,344435,M.S.,"Mr. Ssameer was the best host Ever!!! My story, yeah new to the city and was naive to the ins and outs of the city, and Mr. Ssameer was very helpful and patient with any queries & questions that I had, he was just awesome!

If you don't know the city or the area he'll have a lot of helpful tips for you. He lets his guests use his kitchen so you can save a lot of money if you don't want to eat out every day. His place is literally next to the subway stop, which makes it a perfect location to explore the city from here. I'd definitely stay here again and will recommend it to friends who visit NYC.

Ssameer is a lovely person, easy to deal with and a very warm and caring host. He’ll give you advice on anything from the smartest way to ride the subway, where to find the best pizza or the next dubstep party. After two weeks Ssameer’s home almost felt like my home too. "

There is also a supermarket down the street if one needs to pick up anything. Although I only stayed a night, it was a good experience overall. "

He gave me the contact information of one of the other people staying in his apartment, and he called to let them know that I would be arriving much later than I anticipated. He even made sure the public transportation route that I planned to take was the most convenient way to get to his place. 

The person acting as the host in his place was very helpful. It was very clean and conveniently located. There were plenty of places around it (though, I didn't get to see much because I only stayed one night), and it was very close to the subway. Highly recommended."

I have already recommended ssameer in my circle of friends and will definitely book there again my next accommodation!
"
9668,565398,25/9/11,966244,Lina,"Ssameer was an amazing host! He was very helpfull and friendly. The place also very nice and comfortable, we loved staying in this house!"
9668,589507,2/10/11,114265,Stanton,"Friendly and nice host. Happy stay experience. I felt welcomed. 
The building is pretty old. The room is tiny, which is just a little bigger than a fulton/sofa. But I need to take class during the daytime, and the place is only 2 subway stops away from my campus, and I only need a place to sleep at night, so this place is good to me. 
I felt it's very convenient to commute between my campus and Ssameer's place. For the price and the location, it's a good value. 

Things need to be improved: The blanket and the quilt can be cleaner. They didn't smell very fresh and clean..."
9668,635377,17/10/11,759526,Frank,"We had a great time in NY and staying at Sameer's made it possible. The subway is right there and it takes you everywhere, cheap good places to eat and a very safe neighborhood. 
Sameer was always willing to help us out with anything we needed and had great recommendations for us regarding where to go or what to do.
The more than 150 good comments he has on this site speak for themselves and Sameer lives up to them. 
I lack the words to truly describe what a great host he is, but you can prove that by staying at his place.
Yes, the room might be small, but the bed is comfortable and we slept really well every night. It's cheap and you sleep very well, what else do you need? The rest of the day you have the whole city of New York out there."
9668,662746,25/10/11,1032902,Chris,"Seriously, everything Ssameer wrote about himself is true, He's a real nice new yorker. His positive attitude and general friendliness made me feel welcome in his home, which was one of the things I worried about before going to stay at his place.
The room is, as advertised, cozy, meaning small, but sufficient for base camp. Subway is less than a minute walk from the flat, the grocery store which is even closer was one of the nicest and most deliciously supplied i've seen during my entire week of sightseeing, I guess that bit of information might matter to some people, so here it is :)"
9668,677363,1/11/11,562125,Bryn,"We enjoyed staying at Sameer's place. It's very small but we didn't mind at all because you're just there to sleep anyway. The neighbourhood's safe and the appartment is really close to the subway. Sameer's a great guy who gave us a lot of useful tips and recommended some good restaurants to us (we loved the dumplings, by the way!). Things could be a tiny bit cleaner though, but it doesn't stop us from saying that if you want to stay in NY but you don't have that much money to spend, this is the best place to go. It really gives you the feeling of 'living' in NY, only if it's just for a few days or a week!"
9668,784583,14/12/11,445535,Wibke,"This was the second time I stayed at Ssameer's and just as last time he was a lovely host. I shared the room with a friend this time and even though it's quite small it worked out just fine. Location-wise, this is really a perfect spot. The place is clean and well looked after. It's not the most quiet of houses so you might prefer the other room that's in the back of the apartment if you are sensitive to noises from the stairwell."
9668,795246,20/12/11,1170390,Von,"Ssameer was really friendly and nice. 
My bf was a little shy and Ssameer was totally cool with letting us be. 
The room was as mentioned small, but the location is truly near to the subway. 
I appreciated that Ssameer offered us additional blankets to stay warm. 

All in all, it was a great experience staying here! "
9668,835814,4/1/12,1108800,Fleur,"We spend 12 nights in Ssamer’s apartment. He was really welcoming and friendly, and contact before arrival was easy. Once there and when the sofa was unfolded, do not expect to walk in the ""room"", it’s impossible (6m² max, including a small closet). No ventilation and inability to open the window, and a noisy heating pipe where high heat escapes which is impossible to resolve. The sound insulation is insufficient between the apartments, especially when the stairwell is taken as a playground. In addition, another room rented by SSamer was occupied by two other guests. So the apartment was shared with 5people including the small bathroom, a hallway-kitchen and hallway-lounge. Talking about the bathroom, it includes the toilet, with problems of flush, a broken tub with a cleanliness limited which depends on the cleanliness of the five residents. The apartment on the ground floor offers no light.
Subway, a super market, a McDonalds and many other fast food are really close to the apartment . Thus, the apartment is recommended for small budget and very short stay.
"
9668,870486,18/1/12,523596,Lisa,Ssameer was a great host. He was constantly asking me if I was comfortable.  I really appreciated how warm the apartment was during the really cold week I was there.  The area is great with a supermarket a couple of hundred feet away and all kinds of restaurants.  The train is also down the block!  I definitely recommend his place!
9668,947853,26/2/12,1424033,Leo,"Ssameer was super nice and helpful. He gave us an entire rundown of the neighborhood and getting around the city as soon as we arrived, which was great! The room is tiny but just fine if you´re gonna be walking around the city a lot, like we did. Location is SO convenient! (less than a block away from the subway station) The neighborhood is full of latino families, really colorful...ask Ssameer about the coffee at La Flor de Broadway, you won´t regret it. =)"

9668,998373,14/3/12,317240,Si,"Didn't have much talk with Ssameer but overall he and his gf were very nice. The house was clean and quiet. The room we lived in was quite small, but I guess for 1 or 2 people, that should be enough.

We checked in at 1:00 in the morning and they had no complaints. I appreciated it a lot.

Thanks for a nice stay. Hope to come back soon."
9668,1070564,1/4/12,1974959,Zsofia,"The room was like the pictures and very clean. The apartment is very close to Metro station. 20 Min to downtown. No hot water for shower though! due to a problem that day,... but everything was perfect!"
9668,1108800,11/4/12,1200679,Christine,"Took me a while to get around to this, but I have to write this review because Sameer was an awesome host. He was very hospitable with the space and amenities and always inquired cheerfully about our plans for the day. Also, having the subway so near makes this a great location. By the way, if he raves about a restaurant, go there -- his recommendations were spot-on. It was our first trip to New York and our first experience with Airbnb and we couldn't have picked a more helpful, friendly host. 

Would stay with Sameer again!"
9668,1138185,16/4/12,133157,Eric,"Staying with Ssameer worked out perfectly. I just needed a place to sleep at night since I was out hanging out with friends and seeing NYC all day.  That's exactly what I got. The room I stayed in was pretty small but was perfect for a single traveler. Wifi let me use my netbook to watch tv before i went to sleep and research activities for the day. Neighbors were occasionally noisy but you have to expect that in an apartment situation. Over all it was an ideal, laid back situation. "
9668,1292642,16/5/12,2326501,Tim,"Everything was fine...Sameer and Miranda are very nice and easygoing people! Thanks for the trust and the nice time in your place!
Also the appartment is very close to Metro-Station which makes everything very convenient! "
9668,1675449,10/7/12,2262110,Tracy,"Ssameer is a great host.  He’s friendly, provides great local information, was accommodating to requests, and made sure we were comfortable. 

The place is a little small and he provides the bare essentials (towels, sheets, pillows, etc.), but if you are only going to be sleeping there at night, then that works out.  There is a laptop available for use and a fan in each room for the summer months.  

Two big pluses: if you are coming from La Guardia airport, you only need to take one bus (M60), which stops one subway ride from his place. It’s convenient and a lot cheaper compared to riding an airport shuttle and you’ll be using that metro bus pass later anyways.  The other plus is that there is a subway station literally almost right outside his place and the NYC metro is very quick and efficient.  
I would definitely recommend staying here.
"
9668,1730159,17/7/12,204205,Naz,"Everything was great! Just as expected, as per reviews. Definitley most cleanest, convenient, cheapest place I've stayed in NY, and I have used airbnb 3 times now, plus my standards are high lol and I am a harsh critic. Highly recommended! Thank you Sameer for everything :)

9668,1772596,22/7/12,2926062,Karol,"I have to say that it was very pleasant stay. Room was very clean and there is everything in house that you need, including the kitchen in which you can cook. 

Apartment is situated very close to subway, it is less than 3 minutes by walk including traffic lights. Location is safe and good situated if you want to go watch Manhattan. It is about 15-20minutes by subway to Times Squares. Close to the apartment are restaurants, McDonald, Groceries and I did not have problem to get anything to eat at any time during the day or night. 

Ssameer was very kind and told me everything that I needed to know about the location, New York and was very helpful answering any question.

I can fully recommend this place."

Район спокойный, можно безопасно гулять ночью. Всяко лучше, чем жить где-нибудь в районе Таймс-сквер. Прикольный рынок утром в субботу в парке рядом. "
9668,1885143,4/8/12,2832494,Bin,"In general, the location is perfect for tourists who needs to travel by public transportation; The room itself is neat and clean, perfect for people who wants a budget accommodation. Ssameer together with Miranda are just super nice host telling everything you may need for travelling, especially information about good food. :-) I wish to have more time sharing with them, they are passionate about sharing a lot of good experience about the city and if you talk with them, you definitely will feel very happy as they are positively affectionate. I also enjoyed travelling/talking with the other housemates a lot, they are all amazing people in this nice house!"

But Sally was there to answer all of our questions and more. :) I guess we learned lots during our stay: about the city and more important - the people. The place is small but clean and comfortable, especially if you're out to the city for most of your active hours. Great value for the money! 3 mins walk to the subway. Around 20-30 mins by subway to the center of the city etc.  supermarket nearby. Grab your breakfast at the ""flower restaurant"" next to subway station ;-) The area of the city is dominican/spanish-speaking and seems quite safe, even if walking on the streets in the middle of the night. We are definitely coming back some time. 

房間 有一點小但是乾淨， 主人很有客氣， 地區是拉丁人住的， 算是比較低級， 但是感覺滿安全。 到市中心也不遠， 地鐵站也很近 (2-3分)附近有超市。

Очень удобное место, учитывая стоимость жилья в городе, очень и очень приемлемый компромис между стоимостью и расстоянием до центра города. Вполне согласен с ""Йура"" :) "

One of the best things about the place is Sally who will be your host, your friend and your guide to New York if its your first time visiting.  She's lived in New York for a long time and gives excellent advice about where to go.  The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star rating is that, like I said, its not the Plaza:)"

I stayed in Sameer's house for three days. It is pretty close to subway and in calm neighbourhood. The house is not prefect but good. The positive point of the house is the presence of a lade, named Sally. She is so kind, informative and hospitable. You can get lots of useful information about the City of New York from her.

Enjoy from being in New York.

D'autres personnes logeaient dans l'appartement via airbnb, dans une autre chambre.
Nous logions dans une chambre individuelle, petite. Nous avions peu de place pour ranger nos affaires. La chambre et la salle de bain étaient moyennement propres.
L'appartement était proche du métro qui nous amenait au centre de Manhattan.
Nous étions peu à l'appartement car New York est une grande ville et nous voulions en profiter un maximum.
Le prix de location de l'appartement de Ssameer est très abordable. Pour le même prix, voire plus, nous aurions eu un hôtel miteux à New York.
La cuisine, le frigo et la salle de bain étaient collectifs. Il s'agissait plus d'une vie en communauté.

Nous sommes contents de notre expérience. 
Bien que nous arions aimé avoir un peu plus d'intimité, nous avons pu profiter de l'appartement, des magasins alentour (pharmacie, alimentation) et de la proximité du métro.

The room was a little dingy and had a weird smell (sage or something?) that both my boyfriend and I seemed to be allergic to, but the bathroom was spotlessly clean.  The woman taking care of his place, Sally, was really helpful, especially when I got a stomach bug while there (she really mothered me and was so sweet).

She is a really nice person and she really knows her way around town. Our room was a little small and the place, exspecially the kitchen, could have been cleaner, but other than that it was a good first Airbnb-experience. The place is very close to the subway, which will bring you right downtown. I would stay here again for a night or two."

And the apartment is pretty dingy; probably most people I know would have been disgusted. But my husband and I are not easily grossed out, so it was fine for us. 

""Ssameer"" was not there, but Sally was a delight to talk with and, since she knows and loves the city so well, a wonderful resource. 

Oh, and if you want a wash cloth that is not old and stained, bring your own. "

The good: Sally lives there and is great company and the best thing about the place. She knows NYC very well and is always a pleasure to speak with. Location is very good and extremely convenient to the subway and local grocery shopping and dining. Perfect location to explore NYC from. The price is very reasonable. The kitchen is fully-functional and you can save money by cooking.

The rest: you get what you pay for. The building and neighborhood are both fine, but the flat itself is a wreck. The super hasn't been in to paint or do repairs in over a decade and it looks like it's been a hard decade of partying in this place. The pictures on AirBNB look to be several years out-of-date; it's much shabbier now. Sally has cleared pathways through Ssameer's clutter so it's functional but everyday it's like waking up in a squat where there was a huge rave the night before. The electrical switches and outlets are missing cover plates, the floor while clean isn't one you want to walk on barefoot, and there are just mountains of stuff everywhere even bulging out in the closet in the guest room. Again, fine for what it is: an inexpensive crash pad. Great for a guy or two to explore NYC on the cheap but don't bring your girlfriend and don't even think of bringing a young child due to the dangerous electrical situation.

Also, learn from my experience and do NOT park on the street. Sally and Ssameer will both tell you to do so and they are correct that it's technically ""free"" to park on the streets but it was a major hassle and ended up costing me $230. Absolute best case: you'll spend 1-2 frustrating hours 4 or more times a week moving your car and prowling the neighborhood (I had multiple tours of everything between 130th and 160th) fighting all the locals for the few remaining spots before street cleaning times. More likely case: if you have out-of-town plates you'll find tickets on your car just for parking the same way that the locals do (which they seem to be immune to). My advice would be to just pay the $18 per day in the garage on 153rd street. If you can't afford $18 per day just don't bring your car into the city because you definitely can't afford the tickets from the ""free"" parking on the street. You've been warned!"

9668,10902744,12/3/14,11269063,Robert,"My son and I enjoyed a hassle free stay at Ssameers place. It was as described, and may not suit everyone, but was just fine for us. Sally was an awesome host, who made us feel at home right away. She is very easy going, and only only expects common sense and decency in return. Very much like visiting a favourite aunt. We were lucky with parking, finding a place right out front, used the subways otherwise. Only had to move the car  on weekday mornings for an hour or so. Lots to do and see in the area while doing so .Affordable, friendly, safe and easy to get to where  you want to go while in NY, this is a place worth checking out."
9668,11140020,22/3/14,4255126,John,"Very pleasant stay. Ssameer is very flexible when I showed up later due to delays. Subway is only 1 block away, very convenient to get to anywhere in NYC. I would recommend and come back again when Im in NYC again."
9668,11546351,7/4/14,12855701,Clare,"I had a very mixed stay at this apartment. Sally had broken her back and Ssameer was travelling which meant no one was at the apartment when I arrived at 1am and I had to spend the night at a local motel. The next day I had to go to Sally's hospital on the first day of my trip in order to collect keys for the apartment to get in. When we were able to access the apartment, it was extremely dirty with very dirty floors and dirty dishes in the sink. There was also a dog which no one had warned us about. 

After we managed to clean the apartment, it was a much more habitable environment but a disappointing way to be greeted. Again these factors were no fault of Sally or Ssameer. Its major advantages are it's very close to the subway and the 1 train is extremely convenient for travelling into Manhattan. 

After communication with Ssameer, he was prepared to offer me a $60 refund which was disappointing considering the hassle I went through with the apartment but at this point I'd like this to just be resolved. "

Super buena ubicación, buenos restaurantes donde se come bien y barato y a dos estaciones de la Universidad de Columbia. Sally me estuvo dando unas clases de pronunciación en inglés y conversamos sobre muchas cosas, desde Borges hasta las políticas de reciclaje en New York.  encanto de mujer :)

Después de que conocimos a Sally y Zorro (el perrito) quedamos muy contentos, Sally es muy amable y super amigable, nos dio varios tips para conocer bien NY. El cuarto es lo que promete, una cocina muy pequeña pero nada que no se pueda reparar con una buena compañía. No hubo ningún problema para estacionar el carro, así que si van en coche es un buen lugar."
9668,15638223,13/7/14,13728370,Por,"I went to New York for 4 days ,so I stay at Ssameer hosuse. Sally is my host ,she's very very very nice and very kind. So now I'm talking about Ssameer house. 

Saameer place is small apartment and I got a front room of that apartment. It's a tiny room ,but it's enough to staying for 2 peoples (no air conditioning).

You have to share a kitchen and bathroom with 3-5 peoples (Sally /Sally's son /other guest) but that's not bad at all. 

A bathroom is not clean at all but it's not bad. 

If you looking for a very cheap room in New York and easy to travelling you can choose this one. Because it's very close Metro subway (red line #1)

For voyager /traveller /backpacker. This place is good for you guys. But you looking for a big room ,beautiful view ,good facilities I think you should try to find another place such as a hotel and you have to pay double or triple money for that place. It's very expensive.

La chambre est petite mais l'accès libre à la salle de bain et à la cuisine compense largement ! Sally est vraiment super agréable, elle connaît beaucoup de choses, c'est un plaisir de discuter avec elle (et son fils quand il est là!). L'appartement est en rez-de-chaussée, très pratique quand on est chargé ! "
9668,18012000,20/8/14,9969763,Jorge,Ssameer rents out the room for the duration of your stay but you will never actually see him. Sally is the one you interact with and the one who helps you out. She's very generous and knowledgable. She provided some advice for our time in the city and on the east coast. Thanks!

Now on every time I go to New York I hope to stay here. "
9668,21478579,18/10/14,1130915,David,"Summed up: this place is a cheap room that's relatively close to Manhattan and very close to the 1 train. That was exactly what I was looking for so this place worked out well for me.

What to expect: You won't see much of SSameer, but there is a woman Sally that lives in the apartment and she is there pretty much all the time. Sleeps in the main room. The room that you sleep in is small but clean, and has a lock on the door which I appreciated. The rest of the apartment not as clean, mostly due to a small dog that lives there. There are wee-wee pads spread out on the floor around the apartment so if you're squeamish about dogs and their urine, this might be a problem. Additionally, there were 2 people staying in another room in the back. This means 5 people sharing one bathroom, which can be problematic. The bed itself if a futon, with ikea-type folding frame thing. Not very comfortable but at these prices I wasn't expecting luxury.

All and all, it's an affordable room. It will not enhance a vacation experience. But if you just need a cheap place to sleep in an expensive city and don't mind the hostel like environment, it does the trick."

The room was comfortable. I sleep very well on the bed. The location was perfect for traveling anywhere in the city. The subway was very close and the neighborhood safe. I would use this rental again.
9668,23310764,28/11/14,15892513,Michelle C.L,Ssameer is nice and kind. He always reply message quickly. We got no problem to find this place and got many tips from him. The apartment's location is absolutely great(walk 3mins to 1 train). Room just like the photo: a futon bed and a closet. The kitchen and fridge you can use. Shower is ok but I took a bath one night which is awesome. There is a small dog in the apartment. Overall this is a good place for us to stay in NYC.

This time Ssameer was abroad but I could always get in contact with him online if necessary. Also, his flatmate Hang was there - a very nice, pleasant and helpful girl. I am a person that is very organized and plans everything so I suppose it can sometimes be a really demanding person that asks l (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) ts of question. Both Ssameer and Hang never lost their patience. Ssameer knows everything about the city and can give you great advice about where to go, that to see etc.

I stayed in the front room again - there is a day sofa and you also have a tiny closet in that room. The apartment is located in Harlem, I felt safe there. It's not a very noisy neighbourhood (no busy street), the subway station (City College) is 2 minutes away. You can go straight to Midtown (42nd Street) without having to change trains, and it doesn't take a lot of time either. There is a McDonalds, a small supermarket as well as a laundry center right around the corner.

I really can recommend stayin' at Ssameer's.

9668,140037788,27/3/17,49376753,Trey,"Trip and his roommate Hang were very nice hosts. Their place is very close to the 1 train. It's in a residential and commercial neighborhood, near City College.  Know that the room and kitchen are small though, so if you need space this may not be the place for you. Overall, I'd recommend Trip's place to travelers that want a cheap and simple place to stay near the train with a friendly host."
9668,140521379,30/3/17,117528041,Marie,"We met Ssameer just a few minutes at our Check in. He seemed more than friendly and helpful. Also he was very flexibel and answered questions very fast. 
I am sorry to mention this but the kitchen and the bathroom were not clean partially. Our room was clean. 
Also the heater and his roommates were very loud during the night but this is definitly not Ssameers fault.
Anyway we enjoyed our stay. "

My stay there was ideal and I greatly enjoyed both the perfect location of the place ( a few minutes away from the metro), and the kindness of my host. Ssameer welcomed me even though I arrived way earlier than the expected hour, and was always very considerate and helpful ! A perfect stay."
9668,147248614,25/4/17,124220138,Leonel,"Excelente ubicación a un par de cuadras del subte 1 !!!
Tenés un supermercado a una cuadra, podés cocinar en el dpto así que abaratás más aún los costos.
Tranquilo, seguro para caminar, incluso un día volvimos cerca de las 0:00 y no nos sentimos inseguros para nada.
Es modesto y el cuarto es muy pequeño, más de lo que aparenta en las fotos pero es limpio y está muy bien para el precio que pide.
Además la atención fue muy amable.
Muy recomendable si querés gastar poco y estar a un toque de cualquier lado a través del transporte público. 
Sí van a estar 6 o 7 días conviene sacar una tarjeta de metro (metrocard) ilimitada por 7 días (u$33) que sirve también para los colectivos."

9668,150250775,7/5/17,41832438,Joseph,"This space is not for someone that needs to be pampered. Rather it's for someone that's looking to spend time out in the city and needs a comfortable place to sleep. 

The room is small as mentioned. But it's just what a single traveler needs. It's located right by the front door and next to the bathroom, which I found to be very convenient. I didn't feel like I was in the hosts way. 

The host was very available for any questions or needs. 

The location is a very short walk to the 1 train and a 10 minute walk to the B/C lines. The neighborhood was great. Great deli spots, pharmacy, laundry, bars, and grocery all within walking distance. I would definitely stay here again. "

할렘가라고 해서 위험하다고 생각하시는 분도 많고 저도 걱정했었는데, 의외로 구석진곳에 있는게 아니라 큰 도로에 문이 있습니다. 가끔 밤에 돌아다니면 말거는 사람들 있는데 음식 구걸하는 착한 거지거나 노래틀어놓고 같이 춤추자고 하는 사람들 정도? 그래도 안심하라는 뜻은 아니니 어딜가서든 조심하시는 것이 좋습니다. 숙소 바로 아래로 조금 걷다보면 푸드마켓있고 요리할수 있는 공간 있고 방이 좀 낡긴 했지만 오래 살것도 아니고 침대가 편해서 괜찮습니다.

9668,162393723,20/6/17,126356368,Zain,"Ssameer is a wonderful host. I stayed at the location on 138th street. Ssameer welcomed me personally and gave me useful tips about restaurants and places to explore in NYC city, and in Hamilton Heights in particular. The room was tidy and comfortable to sleep in; the kitchen, bathroom, and living area were very also clean and well kept. I was given keys to the apartment as soon as I arrived and was free to access it anytime I wanted. Ssameer responded promptly whenever I messaged him over phone. He was very friendly and kind. Though I am very familiar with much of Manhattan, this was my first real introduction to the borough north of 125th street, and I really enjoyed staying in the Hamilton Heights neighborhood. It's a vibrant and colorful neighborhood, with many nice places to eat at walking distance, and the beautiful St. Nicholas Park and the City College campus architecture in close vicinity. The 1 train is also just mere feet away from the apartment, making it very easy to get anywhere in the city. 

I would highly recommend this room and Ssameer to others. 

Thank you, Ssameer. "

Les sanitaires étaient dans un état déplorable. Je les nettoyais tous les jours tellement l'état était dégueulasse: poussière,  cheveux partout (sol, baignoire, lavabo, miroir), abattant des WC abîmé. Il y avait même des cafards. J'en ai ramassé un qui est resté mort dans le couloir de l'entrée  2 jours durant, aux yeux de tous. Moi qui comptais prendre de temps en temps le petit déjeuner à l'appartement, l'état de la cuisine m'en a dissuadé. Quel stress! Cela ne me donnait absolument pas envie de rester à l'intérieur. Certes le logement est très bien situé,  mais je ne recommande pas ce logement dépourvu d'hygiène et de propreté. Surtout pour le prix payé..."

Our room had no AC, there was trash in it when we arrived, and we weren’t confident that our linens and towels were clean. In addition, the WiFi was out, but it wasn’t a big deal because we were gone all day/night. Probably wouldn’t stay again unless significant improvements were made. This place would be okay for a place to crash for one night."

The bedroom is incredibly spacious, and Teri's home is a warm reflection of the interesting and beautiful person that she is. It's situated so close to the subway, that you can be downtown Manhattan in a flash or alternatively, hang out in Harlem at the great cafes, bars and other night spots. 

I can't wait to catch up with Teri next time I'm in NYC!

9704,15292974,6/7/14,5851255,Monique,"Unbelievable! I haven't been in that area in a while, and the description was spot-on: it IS the best area in Harlem and I had an absolute blast. The apartment was clean, Teri was amazingly accommodating, friendly and just a beautiful person to be around, and the area offered more than I had time to explore. Just book it-it will be the best experience."

The neighborhood is also very welcoming with sidewalk cafes, nice restaurants and cool places to get a drink and listen to music within just a few blocks.  Teri's recommendations for local restaurants and coffee shops were all great.  For runners, you can start a run in nearby Morningside Park and then connect to Central Park -- you are just 10 blocks north of Central Park.  Getting around is also easy as there are subway stops just a few blocks north and south.  Columbia University and CCNY are both within walking distance.  Highly recommended."
9704,18820035,1/9/14,17695965,Henrik,"Teri is a great and welcoming host. The place is exactly as described. Its clean and neat and the location is great. There is a large closet for storing your clothing.
The apartment is quiet although you can hear the street, which really just means ""New York"" to me.
Fredrick Douglass Ave has a lot of restaurants, Morningside park and Columbia is a short walk. The 125 street subway stop is very close and have lots of options including express lines that will take you anywhere in Manhattan end beyond. 
I would stay there again and I recommend others to do the same"

Harlem is a really interesting neighborhood to explore and everything I needed, like restaurants, grocery stores and coffee shops, were nearby the flat. 
A Metro station is also close by, so I was very fast in other parts of town.

Teri is such a nice and helpful person, I felt very welcome during my stay.
I would definitely stay there again!"

Cafes and restaurants are just outside the door, there's Morningside park very close by and Central Park down the road.

9704,61932413,9/2/16,51577831,Matis,"Teri was an amazing host, and the apartment is incredible. The description falls short to explain how comfortable and welcoming this room is. Teri's amazing taste into decoration just bring this room and the apartment to another level, a truly harlem apartment. I liked this apartment so much that I changed my travel plans to stay in New York all my stay, instead of travelling to DC after the first week. 

I staid on February, plain winter, nevertheless when I entered the apartment I had to take almost all of my winter clothes off and just keep my t-shirt, as this building central heating is just amazing.

Teri also leaves you towels and another set of bed sheets, making it really convenient for long stays. The apartment and the room are also extremely clean, and there is a lot of space for your clothes and any other luggage.

The location is perfect for travelling all around Manhattan, with the lines ABCD really close, all you have to do is just walk 3 or 4 blocks and you will be able to go almost anyway around the city. There is an amazing store 1 block away, which has EVERYTHING you might need in terms of food, no joking, it has everything you might think. I'm really picky with food, so usually for me its a challenge to find store were I can find something I can eat, but this place was amazing. There is also a smaller grocery store crossing the street, that has a very practical ATM, although there are ATMs all around, this one is really close.

This part of Harlem is really amazing, I walked alone almost everywhere around anytime after dark, and never even once saw something violent, or disturbing, or anything that made me even cross the street. The lack of big buildings is something to note, as you will most likely be able to see the sky from anywhere. Columbia University is close, and its an amazing place to visit.

You also have a cinema on 125th at USAHarlem, which present AMC movies. So whenever you had a night without plans you can just end up going to the movies.

I came here to both travel and work. I spent most of my days working, and then spent the afternoons visiting places and traveling around. My stay here was splendid, and I was able to work all day at my room, being really comfortable, as well as being able to go anywhere really quick from here. To be honest, I would have paid more for this room, is just amazing, evidently Teri's experience in Airbnb since 2009 has led her to the perfect price so I can't argue against that, I'm extremely happy with this room. Just stop looking for another place, this is the one."

She sent an email with key information a few days before we arrived in NY and always gave us lots of advice on places to eat&drink. If you are planning a visit, Double Dutch coffee is the absolute best place for coffee!
The area is safe and full of amenities, including a supermarket. Very close to Central Park and subway. 125th Street is ideal if you are coming from JFK, with express A trains running every 10-15 mins (check timings on subway's website if you are travelling over the weekend).
Great chance also to spot little jazz concerts in the area and gospel choirs on Sunday.

Also there are a lot of good stores on the 125 street very closed to the apt. Do I recommend Teri's apartment? Definitely YES!"

The subway stations (116th Street and 125th Street) are just a few minutes away from the apartment. The express trains take you -as described- within a short time to Times Square.

The apartment is a 5 minute walk from the subway A train downtown to Times Square, Empire State etc, and local to shops. The apartment is close to the hop on, hop off tour bus near Apollo theatre. There is a supermarket 2 blocks away. The room was decent sized and had good storage. We were very pleased we could use the kitchen and store food in the fridge. Apartment was tidy and we were given everything we needed. The only downside is the neighbourhood is extremely noisy with locals, traffic and sirens. The local shop assistants later told us the neighbourhood is dangerous and not to go out night."

A spacious living room, and the bedroom is plentiful in size, with a simply magnificent bed. If you need to get a bit of work done, theres a table and chair, along with flawless wifi. Theres heating for the cold seasons (I needed that) and there also seems to be an air conditioner in the room too. Of course ideally you will want to be exploring the city, but for the times you want to have a lazy day, the apartment and room will serve you marvellously.

Teri is an absolutely fantastic host, and could not be more helpful and kind. On my first night here, she helped me settle in and even bought a bottle of wine from the downstairs wine store to make me feel even more welcome. She's an amazing host, and an even more amazing person.

The area is simply wonderful for living in the city. Some fantastic bars and restaurants just a few blocks away. Far too many to name them all. A supermarket equally close with everything you would ever need, and express trains down to mid-town and beyond at just 125th. The area is safe, lively, and an exciting place to be if you're looking for that NYC feeling.

Honestly, I could not have asked for more from my stay here. If you were even a little bit on the fence about whether to stay here or not, then I hope that I have been able to persuade you to put aside any uncertainties. "

Her apartment is quite safe, close to great coffee shops, restaurants, and bars, has a conveniently located supermarket within two blocks, and is also two blocks away from Morningside Park as well.

9704,194788280,17/9/17,7604622,Baudouin,Very nice stay in Teri's apartment which is located on the 8th avenue in Harlem at a very walking distance from the subway (with the A line - express - 15 minutes from down-town Manhattan and also many other lines). We had a private large room with a comfortable bed plus a private bathroom at the opposite side of the hallway and could also use the kitchen to make some cooking and we did it a few times ! Same with the living room when Teri wasn't there and did it too. We had nice talks with her even if we didn't met so often because NYC is an amazing city where there is so much to do. Thanks Teri ! We highly recommend Teri's room.

It is also close to the Apollo Theater and stores and restaurants. Teri provided suggestions for restaurants, coffee bars and also an excellent grocery store just up the street.

9704,241517090,9/3/18,52813271,Helen,Teri是一个特别热情、可爱和善解人意的女生，浑身充满活力，特别友善，我出门很冷的时候她还会借衣服帽子手套给我，真的非常感谢她在我居住期间对我的关怀！她的房间装潢漂亮，家具设备一应俱全，厨房有各种厨具，床非常柔软舒适，离116街地铁和125街地铁有6分钟走路路程，好多辆地铁通过，非常方便，晚上也很安全，唯一不足的是沿马路，早上窗口有点汽车声音，不过我这个问题可以解决。

O check in foi tranquilo, pudemos deixar nossas malas antes do horário de entrada e também contamos com flexibilidade no horário de saída.

La casa es acogedora y está decorada con gusto. La habitación en que me quedé es espaciosa; estaba limpia, ordenada -igual que el baño- y disponía de una cama amplia y cómoda. 
Teri es una excelente anfitriona, amable, atenta y rápida en las respuestas. Le volvería a pedir alojamiento sin duda."

Thanks to the comfortable bed we were able to recover after our long days of 15+ kilometers of walking. Teri is super host as well. She's been always enthusiastic to get to know us better and to give us some tips and tricks for our stay in the city. It's a pity we were so busy and tired and we couldn't spend more time with her. I highly recommend this airbnb.

He made sure that I had everything I needed, and even went as far as going out of his way when I was staying (just moved to the city) to inquire about getting me a job with a friend.  It's just a short walk to the subway from here, but the best part about the place is that there's so much cool stuff around that you may not ever want to use the subway.  I have no problem giving this host 5 stars."

Andrea is super nice and helpful with directions when we needed to get there. The living space itself is well stocked with all your necessities - kitchen, bathroom, computer with internet. There are even the perks of having a really large living room, a rooftop, a piano and a great host. Highly recommend!"

and more! sometimes we would come home to find a band in our living area having a jam session, which was cool. the only downside of this was that you could have randoms in the apartment at any time. but everyone who came in and out was super friendly and trustworthy. we had a great stay here"
9782,63764,11/7/10,161206,Lizz,"Great place.  The sleeping loft was comfortable (with A/C)and exactly what we needed for our short stay.  Andrea was easy to get along with and gave us our space without coming across as unwelcoming.  If you need a budget-friendly, practical stay then this is the place for you.  I'd say it's pretty private.  Convenient to two train lines and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE).  Places to eat very close by. The roof-top deck was the highlight of our stay.   "

9782,80305,17/8/10,188071,Elise,"We lived at Andreas place for a week. He responded quickly to our emails, and gave us answers to all our FAQs. That was really nice and trustworthy. He explained us how we got from the airport by Taxi, Bus or Metro and how much approx. it would cost, which also was to a great help. We received the key and got a brief tour of the apartment and its facilities immediately. During the week we stayed at Andreas place, there was a relatively high turnover of other travelers. Everyone was extremely nice and we didn’t feel insecure at any time. The apartment is located just off of Interstate Motorway 278, so there is some noise, but we had no problem sleeping.
The apartment is located about. 15-20 min. walk from the nearest subway, but it’s very close to the really exciting area of Greenpoint. Overall, Andreas apartment is ok to the price, but could use a good cleaning from time to time

His apartment is comfy, albeit spartan, and secure, as well as a nice place to chill out and spin some vinyl. The rooftop is a great amenity, and you'll find most of anything else you'd need to get you through the day within 15 mins walking or less. Andrea himself is a very mellow, accommodating and interesting guy.  "
9782,100238,19/9/10,193347,Sarah,"Andrea's place allows you to be independant and live at your own pace. I've always loved the neighborhood and was glad I could find something so close to it. He's funny, available resourceful, and the other guests (several rooms are available for rent) were friendly and adorable. I've had a great time.

It just so happens that Andrea's place is also tornado-proof ;)"

9782,130190,31/10/10,170088,Rean,Great place to stay for a real NY experience. Andrea's map of local places to eat and brief rooftop survey of the neighborhood got us off to a good start and no problems at all with the facilities.
9782,138105,13/11/10,37642,Monica,"  I absolutely loved my stay here with Andrea, if you are looking for a true New York living experience, this is it right here! The feel of the place has a very artsy and ecelctic essence to it. Andrea himself is a great host, he makes you feel right at home. The neighborhood itself has many different types of restaurants and cafes to explore. Not far from the L or the G train if you want to go to Manhattan. I highly recommend a stay with Andrea if you are ever in New York.

9782,165746,4/1/11,328237,Amelia,"Andrea's place was great, really cozy private room in an awesome old fish factory. Lots of room for meeting other renters in the loft while still getting our own space. Even during the hectic New Year's time, Andrea's place was the bees knees for four wonderful nights in Greenpoint."
9782,171811,18/1/11,256546,Jakob Toftegaard,"We were three guys from Denmark staying at Andreas place for a few weeks over New Year's Eve. He was nice to us, and it was a good experience to live there. It was a bit cold because of the weather, but there were plenty of heaters. The apartment has a lot of rough edges and some dust in the corners, but it has a comfy. The kitchen has the basic necessities. Bathroom is ok. Nice to have a piano in the living room! :) 

It's a 15 minutes walk to Graham ave subway - 15 mins to Union Square, Manhattan and 5 minutes to Bedford av in the heart of Williamsburg (lots of nice shops and cafés). Remember to stop by Variety café on Graham av just before you get to the subway. The best coffee in NY :)

Bottom line: You won't get a better place to stay at such a low rate.

Cheers,
Jakob, Frederik and Simon"
9782,174126,24/1/11,16021,Clay,Nice place! Kitchen had plenty of supplies & Andrea showed me around the neighborhhood a little. Would recommend staying here.

Good walking distance to the L train too. Andrea is very accommodating and great to deal with. Would definitely stay again!"
9782,374657,15/7/11,568838,Tatiana,"Andrea is a wonderful host. Too bad that i couldn't stay more. Clean rooms, perfect place, close to everything (well, not too close to Manhattan but it's not hard to get there), wonderful places to go out. Five stars!!!:)"
9782,390159,23/7/11,547841,Yiyun,"With this being my first booking through airbnb, I had no idea of what to expect from living in someone else's place. Was kind of thrown off by the area at first, as it looked kind of shady. But other comments on the place were kind of true, as it is a relatively short subway ride away from the city area. It's not a very short walk to the subway station, but as long as you stay near the main road, you should be fine. 

If you're planning to park on the street, make sure you park on st anthony and not lombardy  though. Our car got broken into and the gps got stolen after the 1 night that we parked on lombardy. we were kind of afraid that our entire car would get stolen with the broken window, but when we parked on st anthony, it didn't. (so i guess st anthony's really a lot safer with greater traffic) 

The place was kind of messy when we got there, and cleanliness can definitely be improved on. Otherwise, it was really cool to have almost the entire place to ourselves. It's a lot of space for around $30 per person per night in the city (had 5 people in my group)

If you have a choice of rooms, try to pick room 1. Rooms 2 and 3 are near the highway, and the trucks do make it kind of difficult to fall asleep for the light sleepers. 

Otherwise, Andrea was a great host, who provided tons on information on the area. It was a good stay if you're travelling to NY on a shoestring. "
9782,464791,22/8/11,651993,Clement,"With three others friends we were hosted by Andrea during one week. Andrea gave us a very warm welcome and was everytime ready to answer to every touristic questions ;)
The place is well located about 15-20min to the subway and less than 45min to Manhattan. Rooms are furnished, air-conditionned and the highway noise wasn't a big issue to sleep. The living room is huge.
I would hardly recommand Andrea's place for everypeople who need a ""home"" for his stay in NY."
9782,492059,1/9/11,612706,Maria,"Our stay with Andrea was over all a nice experience, but there are some things that are worth noting;

- There is no shower in the apartment you are renting, you have to go across the hall and shower in Andreas apartment. It was a bit of a suprise for us, but we got keys and kind of got used to it.

- The apartment is very spacious, however there are only three bedrooms that have double mattresses, so two of us slept in the livingroom. We were both comfortable anyway (I can personally recommend the couch), but it is still worth knowing if you are more than 6 people traveling.

- If you can't stand clutter, this place isn't for you.

- The road noise is non-stop, but you get somewhat used to it.

Basically, there are a few things that could be better, but as far as the price goes, you will not get more space for the same money anywhere else that close to Manhattan.
Some other really good things about the place is:

- It is Very spacious. We were 8 people but there was no sense of being crowded at all.

- The soundsystem and the projector are great if you want to have a houseparty, which you can, because there aren't any neighbors! Except Andrea of course, who will probably want to join you anyway :)

- There is a 24h gas station with a small shop pretty much right outside the door, and the liqourstore is about a block away. The subway is only 10/15 minutes away. (The L train will take you to Manhattan in about 15 minutes)

When it comes to our host, we didn't have a lot of problems.
We hung out with him quite a bit, and he played Radiohead for our friend at Barcade, which was nice. He knows his way around Williamsburg, so ask him for directions if you need it."
9782,568349,26/9/11,590519,Kevin And Rosie,"Andrea's place was great! The price is amazing for New York. We had loads of room, it's a short walk to central williamsburg and a subway stop.
We had a lot of fun here, highly recommended! Thanks Andrea.

9782,684384,1/11/11,334495,Chris,"your going to NY.  you do NOT want to spend $1400 on a avg hotel and you want to really feel like a real NewYorker.  you must stay at Andreas place then!  it is a true loft built in an old smoked fish factory in the best neighborhood ive found in Brooklyn.  the location is great, short walk to the L train which is only two stops to union square!  make sure to grab a beer at the boulevard tavern and to wake up the morning after those beers grab an amazing Japanese cold pressed coffee at the 'Tar Pit'.  both spots are a 5 min walk tops.  the best part about Andreas place is the fact you also get to be Kramer when you use the shower across the hall.  Andrea was great at meeting me at the loft and showing me everything I needed for my weeks stay.  his (Hidden by Airbnb) map with recommendations is excellent making him a great host!  

i really recommend staying here and really experiencing real Brooklyn loft living! "
9782,719967,14/11/11,1384499,Roman,"Andrea is a nice guy. Apart from that, there a couple of minuses for this deal:


1) his apartment is directly located next to the highway, my room was just feet from the street. It makes for a very ""urban"" feel

2) the mattress and the shower are absolutely ""not OK"", even for the USD 50 per night. I mean, common, some cleanliness would be respectful of your guests. 

Other than those two major objections, I liked it :-) The subways are about 10min away and there is easy access to get into town. 
"
9782,770586,7/12/11,1453318,Anne,"A nice appartment but some bad details.
if you don't mind :
- being 20 minutes away from the subway in an industrial area
- being next to  the highway
- a dirty shower and sink and the bathroom is in another loft ! 
you can contact Andrea !

By the way, Andrea answered really quickly to our messages (text or e-mail), it was very pleasant."
9782,779569,12/12/11,1342481,Jessica,"I stayed here during December and it was great! Andrea was very nice and hospitable when he gave my friend and I a tour of the place. The main area is very open but the bedroom is very quiet considering there was a another group of people rooming in the room next to us. From the outside, the place looks a bit sketchy because of the location (pretty empty neighborhood, next to a gas station, highway is right above it) but I felt really safe once inside the apartment. Right next to Williamsburg and a pretty quick trip to Manhattan as well."
9782,811090,28/12/11,1515641,Yoong Sin,"This is an interesting place to stay. But the time when my friends and I got there, it was not as organized and clean as shown in the picture. It seemed like renovation was going on and stuff was scattered every where. However, it's cheap and private."

9782,915653,12/2/12,1633471,Arian,"We are a band that came for a week to Brooklyn for a recording session.

9782,1006301,17/3/12,1686915,Jocelyn,"Andrea was a great host. We enjoyed coffee and dinner together. While my friends spent  their time galavanting around the city, I spent my time in the quaint apartment with my sewing machine. The roof was an awesome little getaway for when I needed a little break or my friends needed a cigarette break, and the record player was always playing sweet tunes. I definitely would stay here again! "
9782,1187983,27/4/12,601033,Alix,"Andrea is a nice guy ! He was always up for a good laugh. And he was there when we needed help.
His loft is kind of an artstic antique collector's space. There're lots of vinyls, books, instruments and a vidéo projector that you can use all mixed in the living room !
It's perfect if you want to be creative."
9782,1207382,1/5/12,1166261,Jonathan,"Not exactly the most tidy place I've stayed at, but the space and liberty to wake up/come back to the place at my own time is a huge plus. The projector was nifty to use in between outing adventures. The rooftop gives a great genuine view of Brooklyn, the BQE, and the diverse crowd walking the streets at any given time of the day or night. Andrea is a very nice guy and loves his cooking (randomly stopped by one day to look for hot sauce for his chicken, haha!) and genuinely cares and asks if you're enjoying your stay and having a nice time in New York. Again, the price is worth it considering how much space and breathing room you get here.  Wouldn't mind staying at again!"
9782,1227110,4/5/12,1708550,Stephanie,"I stayed at Andrea's apartment with four of my friends and we enjoyed our stay. It is a very interesting apartment with many different things to keep yourself entertained and very decently priced for its location and view. Only a short taxi or subway ride to downtown New York and a convenient service station and McDonalds next door. The cleanliness was a little disappointing especially the shower and kitchen facilities; however, if you are willing to overlook this then everything else is great!"
9782,1302631,19/5/12,1802901,Roman,"This place is  not for everyone.  The host is really nice, but the place is not suittable for families with kids.  The visitors should be aware that they are renting only some of the three tiny cubicles that are built in larger artistic- kind space cluttered with recording and other equipment.  They should not be surprized if they get in one of the cubicle 3 youngish Brits with interest in whiskey and local (street?) girls whom they will bring to the ""shared area"" and whose friend will crash there down on the sofa.  The transportation is not very convenient (the bus to the quite distance subway stop doesn't run on weekends), the place lacks shower or bath (it has a toilet with self-terminating water faucet that ejects water only for a few fractions of a second, for a thorough washing you have to incovenience the host by invading his apartment), the bed linen, the kitchen, and the place do not inspire confidence in their cleanliness.  And last, but not least, the apartment is situated in the middle of a highway (BQE) with trucks braking by down-shifting.  Imagine the noise and air polution 24 hours a day.   But, again, Andrea is really nice."
9782,1319033,21/5/12,2095861,Charlie,Pretty Fun place to stay..fast to get to the city and alot to do around the neighborhood itself..Definitly Reccommend it to anyone that needs a place to stay not too expensive but still close to the city :)

Andrea is very nice and accommodating, when there was a mix-up about how many nights I needed to stay he couldn't have been nicer and more relaxed about it. Great host! "
9782,1555240,25/6/12,691575,Marty,"Andrea is very cordial, genuine and considerate.  The place is an artsy warehouse situated on a busy corner located within walking distance of bars, cafes and delis in Williamsburg. Most importantly, the neighborhood felt safe and the local bars are open late into the night. His price was reasonable and I recommend it if you are just looking for an affordable place to stay while in NYC.  I will contact Andrea next time I plan a visit back east. 

"
9782,1706834,14/7/12,2825003,Nishit,"Andreas's place is really cool and has some awesome stuff around. we had fun playing the piano and checking out all his cool collections. The room was small but with a fan and ac it was well airconditioned. The subway is close by and its easy to call a cab over. Overall, its great for a cheap and short stay not far from the city. "
9782,1775174,23/7/12,2208640,Dhian Martha,"Finally, I could`t go to NYC, but my husband and friends went! My husband is a musician and he went to NYC for band`s tour. He said that Andrea is very nice guy and the house atmosphere is very match with the band. But after all, the choice to stay in Andrea`s house is one of the perfect thing for them. Thank`s Andrea!"
9782,1858890,1/8/12,2448359,Julija,"We stayed at Andrea's for 7 nights. Great space, complete freedom. Loved the roof and the sight of ESB every night.

Andre was very nice, he looks like a very cool dude. Really is, cute guy. 
and the studio is building next door, looks amazing - would love to visit it when it's ready:)
The house has a lot of cool objects, like records, books, piano which is very cool.
The house is a mess, smelly and dirty. and if a guy like me say it - it means it really is..
The location is not the best one - on a highway, 15 minutes walk to find something interesting..
Bottom line - worth the price. girls - look out, it's not for you.

Dans l'ensemble c'est un bon plan"
9782,2567585,9/10/12,3738419,Kawika,Andrea is a really nice guy and a fantastic host.  I didn't expect to encounter that kind of warmth from a stranger in NYC.  His place is really cool - sort of what you'd envision if you were 19 years old and moving to the city for the first time.  All around good experience.
9782,2934833,21/11/12,1152532,Inger-Reidun,"We had a nice time! Stayed for 3 weeks, 
In our bedroom the noise from the highway was really loud day and night. The place was not clean and the the bed not so good.

9782,3020905,3/12/12,2905588,Marta,"The good things about this place are that the host is really relaxed and that there is plenty parking space which is not rare in New York. The bad things are that it is full of dirt and dust. Looks like it has not been cleaned in looooong time. Also, it is quite a walk from the next train station and you have to walk through quite an abandoned area. I would not recommend this place to a single girl because I would be scared to walk home alone at night.  "

I found the loft as you would imagine a home. it was open and clean, with plenty of space and use of electronics during my stay. My bedding was clean and the bed comfortable. IF you are looking for an affordable stay in Brooklyn then you must stay here."

The rooftop was an excellent place to hang out and the bed was very comfortable.  Accommodations were very basic, but a good value for the price. Andrea was very easy to coordinate with and very flexible when our arrival and departure times shifted a bit.  Would definitely stay here again."

9782,5804059,17/7/13,5334350,Maxi,El departamento de Andrea es el mejor lugar que estuve en NY. Esta un poco desordenado pero todo funciona bien y es cuestion de acostumbrarse. Estuve 17 dias y conoci un monton de gente. Andrea es una persona que esta para todo lo que uno necesite. Sin dudas pase el mejor viaje de mi vida. La zona es muy segura. Lo recomiendo 100%.
9782,6420775,12/8/13,6352459,Tatiana,"Je vous conseille d'y rester pas plus de 3jours parce que l'appart est grand mais mal entretenu. C'est bien si vous avez besoin d'economiser mais la salle de bain est vraiment crade (en + je suis pas du genre exigente) la cuisine aussi, sans parler du frigo degueu. Nous avons manger qu'à l'exterieur.  C'est un appart pour les gens un peu 'roots 'a l'arrache.. Nous on a aime le cote artiste de l'endroit mais niveau proprete ca craint, jai choppe une allergie dans les yeux. Le proprio Andrea est cool. "
9782,7014746,3/9/13,7674729,Kathrin,"Ne louer surtout pas ici! 
Yes, Andrea is a nice guy.  However, our experience here was so bad that one of us took a bus back home after staying there for one night.  No wonder.  The place was super dirty and a lot messier than what you see on the pics.  
The fridge had old, open food, mould, flies and lots of spills.  To get to the shower you go through a really cluttered and greasy kitchen.  The shower was smaller than the one shown and was also very dirty - I was glad I had brought my flip flops.  
The place is a nice, open area with 3 adjoining rooms.  None of the rooms lock so you can't leave anything valuable there.  In fact, the door to our room didn't even close properly!  One of our sheets had a blood stain on it and the pillows, which had no slipcovers, were sweat stained.  The towels, though clean, smelled mouldy, as though they had been forgotten in the washing machine.  
Our room was miniscule. 90 % of the space was occupied by queen size bunk beds, leaving no room for luggage and shoes.  I was grateful for my eye mask and earplugs as the curtains were non functional (the sun shines straight into your face) and the building is directly beside a noisy freeway that is nothing like the ""ocean waves"" mentioned in the listing.  The building shakes when trucks go by. 
As well, the nice plants you see in the pics were all dead in a forgotten corner and the pot for the coffee machine was broken   so we could not make coffee.
Fortunately, the other guests were really nice and even did some cleaning to make our stay more bearable.
This reviewer has done plenty of camping, backpacking, etc. and therefore not a stranger to a certain amount of dirt and discomfort.  Nonetheless, I was most disappointed in the accommodations.  I will be returning to the Williamsburg area, but will be staying elsewhere. "
9782,7114518,7/9/13,5046134,Petra,I would never stay at this place again. such a mess this apartment. 
9782,7475763,21/9/13,7716110,David,"Incredible place. Very creative and lots of energy. Lots of funky things to check out. Even has American Beauty on DVD great locale for the movie. One thing, there are some relics from the past that you may think you steps back in time by seeing an old iMac or an old G3 tower but great experience for a flashback. Andrea is a creative & funky but straight to busy dude loved his demeanor."
9782,7945245,9/10/13,7859161,Stephanie,"We stayed at Andrea's only a couple of nights - it was a little different than expected but still a total NYC/Brooklyn experience that we liked.  We had a lot of privacy which was nice - other guests only showed up on the last night we were there.  
The location is fine - close enough to great food, shops, etc.  We walked everywhere and got to see a lot of the area.
Andrea is great!  Super friendly and accommodating.  Gives you everything you need and leaves you be.  
I would definitely recommend the space if you're open to a true experience and not expecting the cleanliness and order of a hotel.  You have to rough it a tiny bit but its worth it and fun - and so affordable!  

Thanks Andrea!"

His communication was great and accessing the unit/keys was super easy. The unit/room itself was tiny but exactly what I needed for my short stay. It has to be mentioned that the room is right beside a busy road, so bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. The room was very inexpensive, you get what you pay for, if you're expecting a five star room you will be disappointed. BUT if you're a simple traveller who just needs a place to recharge then I would definitely say to lock it in. Train station 10 minute walk away and easy to get to. Thanks Andrea! "

To go for a shower, you need to go out of the apartment and into the host's apartment. This shower is shared between everyone. We didn't find anything ready, the sheets were cleaned after we arrived but never put on the bed or anything remotely as that, we didn't receive new towels troughout our stay. We only saw the host the day we arrived in the place. It's very noisy, you can hear the highway traffic from your room. The whole place is full of things, would be quite spacious otherwise, and the kitchen is no exception (it has a lot of things but lacks other basics like a sharp knife). The people were ok but we didn't find the place confortable at all and wouldn't stay again."

L'appartement est identique à la description, un peu roots, mais spacieux. Nous avons été seuls pendant les trois quarts du séjour, ce qui était plutôt agréable. Je confirme que l'endroit n'est pas le plus propre du monde et que l'autoroute s'entend assez fort de la chambre, mais eh les gars, un logement à un si petit prix, on ne peut pas demander le beurre et l'argent du beurre. Je me suis senti plutôt bien dans cet appart. Le quartier n'est pas incroyable mais plutôt safe. Williamsburg et le métro sont à 15 minutes à pied, et par là bas c'est vraiment cool. De toutes façons à New York, il ne faut pas s'attendre à éviter de marcher, de manière générale. On a aussi trouvé un bar bien typique américain à quelques rues de l'appartement, ce qui était bienvenu pour boire une bière après une grosse journée. Je vous recommande cet endroit si vous êtes fauchés mais que vous voulez un bon deal. Maniaques, passez votre chemin :)

Although the place looks like a warehouse from the outside, the inside is very cosy and definitely a nice place to live in. Andreas seems to be a person with a big interest in all kinds of art and music which i really appreciate.
Only disadvantage is the motorway which is quiete close and made it difficult for me to get over the jetlag... 
Anyway- good and safe place, worth the price (for NYC). "

The apartment was a bit dirtier and louder (because of the highway) than we thought but also bigger.

The district is fine and the apartment is not that far from subway (L line is really convenient to go in Manhattan) and also restaurants from Williamsburg (about 10-15 minutes by walk).

To conclude, this apartment is a really good deal for people who search for a cheap place to stay in NY (honestly I think you can't find cheaper anywhere else in NY) and Andrea is extremely accommodating BUT the flat is not made for obsessive cleaners ;)

Thank you again Andrea !!

The loft is HUGE and has everything you need. Its quite noisey from the traffic outside but me and boyfriend slept the sleep of the dead with ear plugs. 
The heart of Williamsburg with all its bars and nightlife is only a 10-15 walk away. And the nearest Subway station is graeme avenue which is 10 mins walk away and is on the L line which takes you straight into Manhattan in no time at all. The location is perfect!

Just if you like it really clean and tidy this place isn't possibly made for you. Expect for that, this great apartment will give you the perfect NYC experience. "
9782,22842482,16/11/14,22615631,Emil,"Andrea was the perfect Air BnB host - friendly, knowledgable about the neighborhood, reasonable in his house rules, considerate, well-prepared, up for grabbing a beer if you are but perfectly fine leaving you alone if you're not.  The space is convenient for the price... the train is about a 10 min. walk then a 10 min. ride to all the Brooklyn/Williamsburg stuff and a 20 minute ride to the lower Manhattan sites.  Accomodations are functional - it's a neat and tidy specimen of a Brooklyn musician's loft, with lots of worn but comfortable resale furniture, the sound of the nearby expressway softly audible (and the auto body repair shop loudly audible during weekday business hours), lots of great records and movies that you're welcome to enjoy and a slight draft from the windows in winter time.  In short, for those used to traveling this way it's great - if my band ended up here after a show back in our touring days, we'd consider it the Ritz."
9782,24120172,20/12/14,23194963,Sean,"Andrea was friendly, helpful and always quick to reply. The apartment was comfortable and close to public transport. I had a great stay. "
9782,25420212,15/1/15,14898266,Maddie,"Andrea was an amazing host! He met me upon arrival and gave me a detailed tour of the loft with instructions on how to use the TV, record player, etc. He was also full of recommendations for places to eat and drink in the area. He keeps to himself if you want your space for the rest of the trip, but I enjoyed picking his brain, as he has a wealth of knowledge about NYC and is just a generally cool guy to chat with.

The loft itself is clean and very comfortable. The other two rooms were occupied during my stay and all of the guests were quiet and considerate of one another. We were all laid-back young people, and that is definitely who will enjoy staying in the loft the most.

It's worth noting that it is not located close to the subway, by most standards (at least a 15-minute walk). But If you don't mind a nice stroll through the neighborhood, then it's nothing to fuss about."
9782,27355745,2/3/15,3546139,Valie,"The room was simple but functional. It has a loft bed that was pretty high up. As I was there in a cold wave it got a bit chilly in the night if you didn't turn on the electrical heating. If you turned it on it even got a bit warm during the night. 
The big room is really nice to hang out with sofas and comfy chairs. There are instruments and mixing desks around so has an artistic feel to it. This is not a place for people who need a perfectly fixed up place but more for flexible folks who don't put a great emphasis on order and cleanliness. 
Andrea is a great host who was friendly and welcoming even though I was two hours late getting there due to airport security and travel problems. 
The location was convenient to get to Manhattan and Williamsburg. I was in Manhattan with the L train in 30 minutes max. The area is pretty industrial so that was unusual in the beginning but had a certain bohemian charm. "
9782,27584570,8/3/15,22676805,Jean-Charles,"Andréa avait parfaitement décrit le logement, et a été force de conseils en ce qui concerne les choses à faire aux alentours.
Andréa est quelqu'un de très cool et de très agréable, son appartement est très atypique, dommage qu'une telle surface soit difficile à entretenir, certaines pièces ne sont pas toujours très propres.
Dans l’ensemble l'appartement est très agréable, surtout pour des jeunes qui décident de visiter New York entre potes ;)"
9782,28024247,16/3/15,28200252,Josh,"Had an absolute blast Andrea and Chris we're both awesome dudes and more than willing to recommend some places to check out while I was in town!  The room was great and because of the amenities I was able to listen to a record I purchased while in town!  Awesome place with plenty to do within walking distance.  I hope to return one day soon!  Thanks!
"
9782,28210444,20/3/15,27417949,Joshua,Andrea is a really nice guy and there are lots of good things about the apartment. Location was good and close to the subway. Easy to get to Manhattan and lots of bars and restaurants close by. Hostel atmosphere was fun. 
9782,28333452,22/3/15,28567084,Yuuki,実際にホストに会うことはなかったが、丁寧なメールはくれた。ただ鍵の開け方が難しくて、一日目の夜は家に入れずダイナーで夜を明かしたので、きちんとホストが出迎えて客の目の前で鍵の開け方を教えたほうが良いと思う。鍵が開けにくいことに関しては、他に泊まっていた人たちとも意見が一致した。家の場所は安全だけど、最寄駅から近くはない。それから、私たち以外に泊まっている人たちがいることを知らされていなくて、到着してびっくりしたので、シェアの可能性があることをホームページに明記すべきだと思う。
9782,29407104,7/4/15,5748708,Veronica,"We had a great stay at this flat, it's a bit shabby but great for the prize, the metro is a 15 min walk away and it's close to Manhattan avenue who has a lot of things going on. Andrea helped out with everything we needed. Thanks "
9782,30677494,26/4/15,28467335,Arabel,"It was very nice to stay at Andrea's place. He is a very sweet and helpful guy and will help you with anything you need. The price was very reasonable considering it was New York and what was offered. The atmosphere in the apartment was chilled and laid back which was also represented a bit in the cleanliness of the apartment.  If you like it extremely clean if wouldn't recommend staying here but if you prefer fun over having a spotless clean surrounding like us it is the perfect place! Also like the others mentioned, don't get scared off by the exteriour of the house there is definetely an aparment inside! Also the rooftop is very nice! Thank you for the host Andrea!"
9782,31579841,7/5/15,29389316,Laëtitia,"Accueil très agréable. Malheureusement l'appartement est assez sale. Mais il est bon de savoir que les draps des lits sont très propres et que les serviettes de bain sont fournies. Sinon, l'appartement est vraiment intéressant et est rempli de trésors. Nous avons pu faire la cuisine à l'appartement, ce qui est très pratique. Il suffit juste d'acheter sa nourriture. 
Il faut un peu marcher pour aller à une station de métro, mais le parcours n'est pas désagréable et le quartier est sécuritaire. "
9782,32681783,20/5/15,28761000,Sofie,"Andrea was just lovely. Got in contact before we arrived to see how we could best arrange handover of keys etc. etc. Kept himself to himself, but was also very approachable when we did bump into eachother. Re. other peoples comments I can only say that the space is fun, extremely priceworthy, close to charming little coffee shops and bars and more. You do share the communal space with others so - of course - Andreas can't always ensure that they clean up. But, again, it's fun and I will most definately go back.  Also, the idea is quite clever - smaller rooms to sleep in, and a big communal space to hang out in. 

Oh, and in Swedish - väldigt trevlig person, framförallt roligt ställe, med små rum att sova i och ett stort gemensamt rum där man hänger med de andra gästerna. Mellan två charmiga kvarter, så små promenader så är ni omringade av diners, cafeer och barer. Avslappnad stämning, och under vår resa, roligt folk som kom och gick! "
9782,36188709,26/6/15,19333624,Jorge G.,"El barrio está en un polígono industrial, junto a una gasolinera y una autopista. Hay obras cerca que hacen un ruido ensordecedor y que tienen pinta de durar meses y que siguen ¡de noche! Unido al ruido de la autopista no recomiendo el sitio a nadie que pretenda dormir. El baño está fuera de ""el piso"" (es un ahumadero de pescado reconvertido) y cerrado con cerradura, en el pasillo, porque si no se cuelan los homeless de la zona y más sucio incluso que el cagadero de dentro del piso. A Andrea probablemente no lo verás y no esperes nada de él (bastante arrogante y de nula ayuda)... Aviso paa aquellos que esperan más por un sitio tan barato, aunque es incluso caro para lo que es. Lejos del metro, además."
9782,37159846,5/7/15,26785303,Endaman,"The apartment of Andrea is perfect for short term allocation. Is a bit far from nearest Metro station, but the Bus stop is right there. The neighborhood is OK. There are good places around. It take 30 minuetes or leas to get in Manhattan. The apartment is not for order obssesives, and the workers of the highway construction start really soon in the morning, but despite that, I found it OK and I had a good time there."
9782,38697526,18/7/15,28847692,YuSheng,Andrea is a nice guy . When we have something help and he will come and help us. 
9782,39356302,22/7/15,38873818,John,Andrea was a good host didn't see him much but he was helpful and accommodating. If you're looking for a quiet place to crash out this is not the place for you. I didn't mind as I'm used to living in a space similar to this space. Overall it was a good experience.  
9782,39867426,26/7/15,9898801,Kelly,"Andrea made us feel completely welcome, and his apartment itself was about as welcoming as anything could be. It is a wonderfully eclectic place, and we would happily return--in fact, since we were quite busy during our stay, and did not get to spend time in Brooklyn, I suspect we'll stay there again soon. 

My only word of caution: if you can only stay in 5-star hotels, this is not your place. And to be clear, this is not a criticism of the place... "
9782,41835170,9/8/15,38457873,Matthew,"Andrea was very accommodating and made the entire experience very good. The communal area is very spacious and there is easy access to a kitchen, Netflix, movies, records, etc. The listing was very good for the cost. I would definitely recommend staying with Andrea.

Some things to note:
While the main room has A/C, the sleeping area does not (though there is a fan and that was good enough.
The Nassau G station is 15 minutes away (Morgan Ave -> Driggs Ave -> Leonard St).
The Graham L station is 15 minutes away (Morgan Ave -> Lombardy St -> Kingsland Ave -> Woodpoint Rd -> Metropolitan Ave).
The Bedford L station is 20 minutes away (Morgan Ave -> Driggs Ave -> N 7th St).7"
9782,44737832,28/8/15,7982324,Maxime,"Andrea's place is really cool. Rooftop access, records & vinyl player with lots of room to chill out. Andrea is a welcoming host and has a good sense of humour. One thing you will want to be careful for is making sure you don't lock yourself up on the roof in the middle of the night.. Haha..... Sorry for waking you up dude. Thanks for helping us out, and letting us stay in your awesome home. Take care!"
9782,45618061,4/9/15,12084751,Arnaud,Andrea is a very nice person. The apartment is good for low budget travellers and if you spend most the time outside. The inside is rather old and not super clean.
9782,47164397,16/9/15,9735450,Valya,"The place is amazing. its hidden from public, you never guess where it is if you dont have the directions - but its so cool. I had a huge bed above the ceiling and there was an exit to the roof where u can see the city. The whole place is very arty and interesting. Ii met Andrea once and he was very friendly and helpful to me. I like the place and i would recommend it for youth"
9782,47696166,21/9/15,5105751,Tini & Craig,"Andrea was an excellent host. Communication was clear and easy from the outset and he was very welcoming on arrival. The flat is located in a warehouse type building which is great if you are looking for something a little bit different for your stay in Brooklyn. The price was very good and I believe I got real value for money. The room was comfortable for what I needed as someone travelling alone. You will also meet other travellers at the apartment which is great if you want a little bit of company in the evenings. The first night Andrea kindly offered to go for some drinks and he was very helpful in recommending good places to eat and drink in and around Greenpoint. Williamsburg is a nice walk away - definitely worth checking out. Moreover, Andrea was kind enough to let me keep a set of keys on my check out day as my bus was leaving at midnight. A great experience. Thanks Andrea for everything"
9782,50673509,13/10/15,44520161,Taniel,Andrea gave us all the information we needed in order to get to know the area. He welcomes us to the place and make us familiar with the apartment and the facilities. The overall experience was satisfying for the amount that we paid. 
9782,51568082,21/10/15,23632642,Georgia,"Andrea was a fantastic host, and helped us with directions for getting to the loft a little late once we'd arrive all the way from Sydney, as well as tips for where to eat and hangout around the area. The place was an awesome spot to start out time in New York, and super close to all Brooklyn has to offer, with plenty of space to chill out at home too!"
9782,56273887,11/12/15,50399965,震,"The house is huge and fantastic. You can find many interesting things in it, like piano and Xbox. Andrea is very warm-hearted, friendly and helpful. Although one of the rooms is near to the street, it's still worth the money."
9782,57642745,28/12/15,14434012,Ilya,"The loft seems slightly better in the photograph than in real life, but it was a nice and atmospheric place to stay for Christmas. There is a great collection of vinyl records with the record player. It's a quiet neighborhood with some grocery and liquor stores nearby, 10-15 walk from the subway station. There is a great view of Manhattan from the roof. The room is quite noisy due to a highway."
9782,58268690,2/1/16,35781474,Caroline,"The apartment was spacious and livable. It was a very pleasant stay and the host was very friendly. It was a little far from the city, but the metro was really close and very easy to use."
9782,60632896,25/1/16,54526511,Allison,"When we arrived Andrea was helpful and welcoming, he showed us around the apartment building and how to use the different utilities. The photos of the apartment are pretty accurate, the interior is rather cluttered. An important note to make is that it is located in a very industrial part of Brooklyn, there is construction blocking off the road that we were not notified of. The subway stop is a solid fifteen minute walk away. The room is advertised as a private room for four people which isn't an accurate posting. Yes, there was enough space for four people to sleep, there was not enough space for four people and luggage. There is a larger room outside of the bedroom however this is meant to be used as a “community space”. Our main concern, however, was that Andrea would let himself into the community space without notifying us. On one occasion he entered and started yelling at us for having our stuff in the community area and cursed at us. On a different day we came back to the apartment at 11 pm to find Andrea’s friend in the apartment. Another note to keep in mind if you are considering renting the room is that to use the shower you have to walk across the hall, through Andrea's apartment and use his bathroom.

Si eres aventurero y no te molesta el ruido de la carretera, este lugar es ideal. 
Esta en un barrio muy ameno y lindo. "
9782,82895266,30/6/16,2648373,Tom,"Firstly, the positives; I made a mistake on the listing and Andrea was good enough to provide a sofa for the first night.

Unfortunately, that's about as far as the positives go...
The sink adjoining the loft space was half blocked the whole time that I was there and full of nasty stuff. Andrea was missing the key to my room so when I locked myself out and asked about it, he couldn't help. He also told me that he was 150 miles away and hadn't organised any backup in case things needed attending; luckily I managed to break in or my whole day would have been spent waiting for him to return. He seemed to think this was my fault because he'd listed ""the rooms don't lock"" on the page. In actuality, if he'd disabled the locks or gotten keys cut, this could have been avoided. Since I booked this trip for business, I need to protect my valuables, which I couldn't do. The seperate bathroom was also very dirty; the apartment hadn't been cleaned properly in months by my judgement. Cables are trailing all over the floor as well. It's like if a group of male students had made an Airbnb (sorry males and students for the stereotype). The bed provided wasn't very comfortable and the ladder used to climb up wasn't secured so that I could easily have toppled it backward (I nearly did on one occassion) and injured myself"
9782,83701981,4/7/16,9013101,Kristopher,The loft got the job and was close to good amenities. The floor was extremely dirty and we never even Andrea though. He relied on a friend to let us in and was apparently out of town but never told us. Seemed unprofessional but good location and he did accommodate early arrival.

The place is JUNKY, Smelly, Overall Dirty. He Checked us in ....and he never came to check on us after like days after. Also THERE IS NO SHOWER IN THE LOFT !! You Have to Go To His Apartment across the hall which we felt was WEIRD and the bathroom was Not Clean... Honestly Before You BOOK READ THE REVIEWS I Wish I Would Have... Pictures didn't match what I Saw upon arrival!!!! "
9782,99538820,5/9/16,46453227,Francesca,"If you want somewhere cheap and cheerful to stay then this fits the bill. If you want somewhere clean then this place isn't for you. The whole place needs a really good scrub, airing and the bathrooms are pretty grotty. 

The room being rented out to air bnb'ers is a mezzanine with the bed upstairs. Gives you plenty of space for storage underneath but does mean a climb up to bed.

The late check out at this apartment is a real plus point.

9782,103652500,23/9/16,90394864,Roman,Place is close to the metro.
9782,104426476,26/9/16,31816561,Felicia,"Andrea was nice and communicated well via phone and in person, but his page communicates an apartment that isn't the reality of it all. The photos are partly accurate. The shower picture was so inaccurate. The bathroom sink next to the kitchen was blocked the entire time. There were flies everywhere...the room, the bathroom, the kitchen. It was so disgusting. I used the toilet once during my stay of 4 days and showered at a friends place. There were so many outlets, the light were dusty, and so was the fan. There were no central lights in the bedroom or bathroom. The bedroom door didn't lock and there were always people in the apartment. The mattress and pillows were so thin. I woke up with my back hurting. There was no comforter on the bed either. He made it clear that you had to go across the hall for a shower..but he never mentioned walking through a gross kitchen that he was usually in, with his shirt off. I wouldn't recommend anyone staying here, let alone a single female unfamiliar with the area. It was clear there was an overwhelming lack of time and effort spent on maintaining the airbnb and he didn't think the way it looked was a problem because he lives the same way or worse in his other space across the hall. 

The smell around the building, in the building, and the apartment were not appealing. The apartment and the building smells stale. The street smells like fish. The street has no street sign, and the place is confusing to get to with or without a GPS. The place was in a sketchy area with nothing nice in the vicinity. Everytime I got out of an Uber or lyft the driver was confused and waited until I got into the building to leave because they thought the area looked unsafe too. The nearest metro station was a 15/20 minute walk. The bed is literally next to the loud highway.

The place is advertised as a nice loft in East Williamsburg with a roof. The loft was a cluttered man cave, that looked like hoarders lived in it. Though it was in Williamsburg it was in the undeveloped industrial area... it is more like Queens than Brooklyn...definitely nothing like typical Williamsburg. The roof had the most pitiful/no existent view ever. He definitely zoomed in and enhanced the picture that is on his profile.
"
9782,112470009,6/11/16,70852942,Callum,Andrea was a helpful and easy going host. We had no trouble getting around and exploring Brooklyn. The rooftop with the view was also a bonus.
9782,115044087,21/11/16,30578598,Jim,"Andrea is an awesome host, super-responsive and fair. The place is a great option for groups, and people on a budget, but not for romantic getaways or fusspots. It's three 'pod' bedrooms opening onto one lounge. Tonnes of space, and full of cool stuff, but the experience will depend on who you're sharing with - and it seems a lot of people for one shower, although that wasn't an issue this time. But if there are any problems at all, Andrea will address them immediately. Don't hesitate to ask - he is friendly and will act quickly. I asked for some things to be fixed/cleaned, and they were, within a day. His place is on the edge of the residential/industrial areas, so everything travel/trendy is 10-15 minutes near, but if you're looking for exterior aesthetics this might not be your thing. It doesn't look great from the outside, but the streets are busy and it felt safe. The main road goes past the place, but it wasn't too noisy - earplugs if you're a light sleeper tho. Perfect if you are on a budget and don't mind a few rough edges - the kind of necessary AirBnB that allows you to experience a decent stay in an expensive city, without taking out a mortgage - just make sure it's right for your needs and you'll be good here."

It's also super clean! 
Andrea is a really cool dude. Thanks for your hospitality, your suggestions and all around friendliness!! You made our trip special! :)"
9782,183974216,18/8/17,133574466,Nicole,"The place is practical, it's perfect for young travelers who just need a place to sleep for a few days and don't mind roughing it a bit. However, it is dingy and a little messy, and the rooms are very small. The pictures and descriptions are not adequate. The noise from the highway was especially disturbing.
All in all though, the place had all we needed and suited us perfectly."
9782,190522520,4/9/17,73832194,Azra,"Value for money and location is great for exploration of the hipper areas of Brooklyn and Manhattan.

Andrea is great, pleasant, helpful and communicative. Expect exactly what the pictures show. This isn't glam but that's not what you're paying for. We used this as a place to sleep and shower before heading out to explore all day and that was perfect!"
9782,199704206,2/10/17,147176610,Philipp,"Sehr cool, eine Wohnung in einer GTA Gegend und mit coolen Leuten - und einem korrektem Gastgeber- auf jedenfall empfehlenswert!"
9782,203215302,14/10/17,43481514,Maarten,"Best bang for the bucks! If you just need a place to crash at night, this is what you're looking for. Subway is 16 min walking, bathroom is accross the hall and it's not super clean. But if you want to find a cheap place in Williamsburg, this is it!"
9782,205009322,20/10/17,69823593,Athena,"This was the perfect place for my partner and I to stay during our trip to NY! It's very simple and a bit rustic, which is what we were looking for. Great for if you're out exploring most of the time. Might be a bit intimidating if you're socially anxious, as it's a shared space and you have to go across the hall for the shower. Right near a bus stop, and a nice 15 minute walk to the nearest subway station. We had a great time here! It's not a 5 star hotel, but who needs that when you're busy checking out the city? 

Andrea was very kind and responds quickly if help is ever needed for anything. Also the roof is perfect to crack a few beers and chill out on."
9782,209583215,5/11/17,1749225,Mai,"The place was simple and had everything you needed. The door of the room was not lockable. Andrea was very friendly and easy to talk to. The shower was in a separate space and was not as clean as I wished for. It was super loud due to highway just in front of window, so don’t forget your ear plugs. All in all, it was ok for the price you paid."
9782,216779907,5/12/17,45831124,Guillaume,"Loft original et intéressant dans son agencement et sa déco. Bien que je n'ai rencontré Andréa que la veille de mon départ, tout a été fait pour que je sois l'aise. Idéal pour personnes comme moi souhaitant visiter New York sans trop dépenser d'argent (et amoureux de pop culture)."
9782,258755868,29/4/18,31646941,Roisin,"Great place to stay on a budget to see New York, 15min walk for the L line into Manhattan or the subway into Down town Brooklyn. The apartment has alot of character and a great view from the roof!"
9782,273847157,7/6/18,85458380,Kerstin,"I liked the place, which matches the explanation. The area is a little industrial, but you can see that from the explanations as well. I felt safe coming home from subway alone and there is a little gas station close by where to get coffee. I recommand taking some flip flops for walking around and entering the bathroom. The key delivery was a little chaotic but in the end worked out. People hanging around were nice. Make sure you are not getting charged for something you didn’t use as for instance a second bed. "

I found this to be nice as it gave me a 10 min walk in the morning through a calm area. There was a local stray cat that was very friendly amd would say hello most nights. "
9782,303951992,8/8/18,9696899,Susanna,"Purtroppo una pessima esperienza, e non mi riferisco ai contro indicati nell’annuncio dei quali già sapevo (vicinanza con la highway, bagno in un altro appartamento ecc), bensì al fatto che l’alloggio è stato ricavato all’interno di una fabbrica in disuso situata in una zona industriale tutt’altro che raccomandabile. Fuori dall’ingresso dell’edificio rifiuti e svariate siringhe ed anche all’interno dello stabile le condizioni igieniche lasciano a desiderare così come nel bagno con doccia adiacente all’appartamento.

La chambre et l'appartement sont conformes aux photos publiées juste une  route qui passe à proximité mais sans doute toujours moins bruyante que dans Manhattan.
Roderick est une personne sympathique et sérieuse et répond toujours très rapidement aux messages.
Vous pouvez lui faire confiance sans aucun problème.

We really appreciate our stay in Roderick loft in Brooklyn, not so far from the bridge, it was the opportunity for us to visit this city.
Room and loft are like the photos you can see, just a road outside but probably less noise than in Manhattan
Roderick is a nice and serious person, he always answer very quicky to messages you send.
No problem, you can go !!!"
9896,106924,27/9/10,240039,Nikki,"Even though it was a very short stay Roderick made everything nice and easy for me, which was awesome since it was a last minute sort of situation. His place is cool, the room is fantastic and if you get to stay here for a few days I'm sure it will be an experience. Also, falling asleep to the sound jazz on the radio and waking up to it was a treat."
9896,112456,5/10/10,239899,Zvezdana,"Roderick's place is fantastic. He was really nice, it was clean and spacious and exactly like the pics. It's a little far from the subway and noisy -- its near a busy freeway. The subway isn't a big deal at all during the day, but at night when you're tired and walking in the dark, it isn't great. That's the only reason I didn't give the place 5 stars. He has a really adorable dog, too! Haha!"
9896,126855,25/10/10,253681,Ivan,Greate loft! Nice Roderick and adorable bulldog Turbo! I recommend to everybody!

The whole experience was just way better than what I expected. I will keep in touch for my next visit. Definitely want to go back :D

There is a delicious restaurant and a cafe next to the building where you can eat very good, clean and a very good price"
9896,527994,13/9/11,664489,Carolane,"This stay with Roderick was great.
We had a great time, the room is clean and looks exactly like the photographs of the site.
Roderick is very kind and available to give information.

The roof terrace is large and the view is great, Turbo dog is adorable. The area is very quiet, you feel safe.

The fridge help to manage your shopping and save money. The bus passes right outside the building and a supermarket is around the corner.

We had a great trip and we recommend this place.

Roderick thank you!!"
9896,543954,18/9/11,241298,Jeremy,"Roderick came through for me at the last minute and offered a private room in his place in Brooklyn for 4 nights. He was really nice and accommodating however I didn't see him that much as I was out a lot.
Great big room, just like the pictures. Standard house rules and even had my own bar fridge. Everything was provided, closet space, towels - the A/C came in handy. The place was clean.
He works from home so is there during the day and also a friend of his was staying on the couch for a few nights so it was a bit of a share house vibe. But I didn't spend much time at home and came home really late anyways so that worked out ok.
Awesome that there is an organic grocer just downstairs, morning fresh juices and coffee were great. Also good to buy fruit etc.
Rooftop was awesome - great views of manhattan. Didn't explore the area too much around the place other than to get some dry cleaning done - just got cabs into the city or went over to williamsburg which was really easy. 
Thanks Roderick!"
9896,575648,27/9/11,105922,Arnica,"The apartment and the common area was clean and tidy. The bedroom was large, spacious, and clean. The bed was also very comfy. =) We picked this place because there is free parking across the street and subway is only about 10-15min walk. The neighbourhood is pretty hip, with a great organic food store right at the corner. Overall it was a great experience. =)"

9896,3171403,28/12/12,3719489,Marjorie,"Everything was as advertised.  Lots of space, comfortable, clean, friendly.  Turbo is a great dog.  We didn't see much of Rod, as we were in only to sleep, leaving early and coming home late. Very convenient for our purposes!  Thanks, Rod."
9896,3264163,4/1/13,2923710,Torsten,"I stayed at Rod's place for about a week with a friend over New Year's Eve. It is located in the Clinton Hill area of Brooklyn. The area is not particularly nice but it doesn't take you very long to get to the really nice places Brooklyn has to offer. There is a bus stop right in front of the door that takes you to Williamsburg, for example.

If you want to go to Manhattan you can take the Green line and switch to the Blue line. The train station is a 5 to 10 minute walk away which can be a little inconvenient but it is not too bad.

The place is really spacious and clean. Rod likes to keep his place organized and neat. We left relatively early and came home quite late sometimes but this wasn't a problem. It was very cool that Rod didn't raise his prices over the holidays like most others did. I doubt you can find a better spot for this price in New York City."
9896,3316977,9/1/13,1373911,Katharina,"The room is really great, I especially loved the perfect wooden floor that is in the whole flat. It is very clean, the bathroom is somewhat basic but everything works well, towels are provided. The room has two large wardrobes to use and there is enough space to put things. It is room located in the first floor and has windows facing two sides, one of them faces the yard, the other one faces the express way, so it is not particularly quiet. Rod's little dog is extremely well mannered and never crosses the door sill and does not bark but loves to get some attention.
Rod is very helpful, and gave us great recommendations for bars, but does not seek communication, though he was in most of the time. Next time I come to New York, I would book it again. "

9896,9104703,7/12/13,6879861,Eda,I actually lived in this building from 2004-2005.   If you want the NYC loft experience than this is the perfect option and a good price.   Clean and exactly as described/photos.    My only regret is that I wanted to play with the adorably sweet puppy doggy but my schedule was too busy ;-)
9896,9601016,3/1/14,9829467,Helene,"I had a nice stay in Rod's apartment. It is very clean and the room is big with a very comfortable bed.
Everything is pretty much as described, so you can be sure that everything works out. 
There is a fridge for you, so you can keeo your stuff there and you can use a very clean bathroom as well. 
The area ist great and the next subway station is not too far. You have your own set of keys, so you can come and go whenever you want to.
The only thing I am sad about is that I couldn't spent more time with the dog ;) "
9896,12785054,11/5/14,10425985,Mario,"Very cool place, extremely spacious and private room. Big kitchen with everything you need for cooking and your own fridge. Awesome rooftop and laundry in the basement. Just outside a big grocery store with fresh food. A few blocks away you can find lots of restaurants and bars. 10-15 min to subway, can't really recommend to use the bus since it's always late. For me it was not well situated because I needed to go to 41st street which took me 45-60 min. But that's just for me. Kate and Rod were very nice and helpful, had a good experience and would recommend the place for others (also as a couple). Thank you for having me"
9896,13196178,21/5/14,11521847,Will,Barely got to meet Rod.  Place was as advertised though ~ 10 min walk to closest subway & grocery store in building was convenient

9896,18415703,26/8/14,2022450,Alex,"Когда я приехал в эту комнату, первая мысль - а не ошибся ли я? На airbnb были отличные отзывы, но проживание полностью разочаровало. 
Начнем с того, что квартира расположена прямо возле дороги и спать в ней невозможно от постоянного шума. 
Формально, в комнате есть кондиционер, но гул от его работы сопоставим с шумом проезжающих машин. 
Еще больше сюрпризов ждало утром, когда обнаружили на диване в общей комнате спящее тело, просящее таблетки от головной боли. 
Кровать короткая и неудобная, ноги упираются в диван, которого нет на фотографиях. 
Из плюсов - небольшая цена и хорошее расположение.

You share the bathroom with Rod and it's could be clean.

9896,225809216,7/1/18,49263936,Marianna,"I wish the ap was cleaner and less mess y. It was really disappointing. Both bathroom and other rooms. Also it could have been nice if the host was friendlier and more polite - at least introduced himself, asked if everything is ok, said goodbye. 
the windows in the room are so old, it was so loud in the room and very cold. It felt like the window was literally open... 
location is not really close to subway, 30 min walk approximately. 
And there were “0” shops or cafes close to it, so breakfast was always a problem."

10452,61774,6/7/10,86844,Nishita,"Some things I really liked about the apartment were the spacious and well furnished room, big screen TV, and a fast internet wireless connection. The housekeeping service was also good but was available only once a week. Kitchen was very well maintained and have all basic utensils, cutlery, refrigerator, stove, and oven. But the fact that it is shared between three rooms and is cleaned only once a week was a challenge at times. The location of the apartment was pretty good, it was quite close to the subway and took just 10 mins from Chambers St. by Subway to transit to Manhattan.The single shared bathroom was a little challenging at time especially since I had to leave early morning. Overall I liked the apartment and enjoyed my stay!"

Highly recommended!"

+ The room we stayed in the most of the time was large and clean. We first were given a smaller room which wasn't just as nice (the wall between that and the other room seemed to be as thin as a paper). Anyway, staying in the other room, we felt like we had all the privacy we needed and it didn't bother us to share the bathroom and the kitchen with other guests.  

+ Location is convinient - just like we expected. 

+ The general atmosphere was all very relaxed and homy at Angela's place. The guy, Chaz, who works for Angela, is very helpful and easy-going and takes care of everything.

10452,402264,28/7/11,698259,Ayaka,"The location is very close to the subway, so it's easy to get wherever you need to go. The building is clean and has a washer & dryer for only $1.50 each, so a pretty good deal if you stay long enough to require doing laundry. There is a ton of closet space, so you can easily store your stuff. Overall a pretty comfortable place to stay in a great neighborhood."

I stayed in the apartment over Thanksgiving break. It was perfect! It's a room to sleep in, which was all I needed. The subway is like two blocks away, and the neighborhood is not terrible (check out the Daily Press, a coffee place on the way to the subway). Didn't really see anything of the other residents, so it pretty much felt like an apartment to myself. "

I've been getting along reasonably well with the (Hidden by Airbnb) , the C train being 3 blocks away is very convenient, the neighborhood-- while not super nice-- is safe. There's a deli/grocery across the street that's cheap and good. All in all I'd stay again."
10452,1013907,18/3/12,1349205,Nikki,"The place was more or less exactly as I expected standard-wise. Everything was clean and well-kept, and both Angela and Cas (the 'house-keeper') were friendly and service-minded. The place is also close to the Metro and has a fairly well-sorted supermarket close by. The only minus might be for anyone who has a problem sleeping as the area was a bit noisy night-time."

Angela is very flexible with The check in & check out time. Just let her know in advance. During our stay we cooked a couple meals. The rule is simple, you use it, you clean it. We shared the entire apartment with may be a couple of people but the privacy is not an issue at all. I never have to wait for bathroom, kitchen or anything. It was never in use when I needed it. 

We did use a washer and dryer, keep your quarters. You gonna need 6 quarters for washer and the same thing for dryer. 

Subway is 5 mins walk to C train. From there, you can transfer to anywhere. Just a tips for a first time visitor like us, get the unlimited 7 days metro card. So you don't have to worry about refilling your card. 

On the way to subway, when you walk on the left hand side of street heading toward Fulton st/Franklin Ave station, you will find a cute coffee shop called Daily Press, grab a cup of coffee before you head down to subway. Their latte is amazing.

We are grateful for our stay. No problem, no hiccups whatsoever. 

Thank you, Angela! "
10452,1525993,20/6/12,574887,David,"Where we stayed was not the place shown in the pictures. I was very disappointed in the state of the place - it was quite dirty. The doors were all sticky with dirt, the carpets were trashed, and the bathroom smelled like a college dorm bathroom.

That said, for $50/night, it's not a terrible value. The A/C worked great, which is important for NYC in the summer, and our sheets and towels were fresh and clean. The person who greeted us was very nice and made sure we had enough clean towels, two sets of keys, etc.

Although in a relatively sketchy neighborhood, the place felt very secure. If you decide to stay here, make sure you don't get lost - we almost got robbed after we took a wrong turn from the Subway station a few blocks from the place.

If you're doing NYC on a budget, this is a suitable option."
10452,1593645,30/6/12,2196658,Karl,The apartment we got wasn't the same shown in the pictures. Also turned out to be shared apartment which was not stated in the description. We also got to pay an additional fee of $20 due to late check-out though it said flexibel check-out in the listing. Beside that everything was ok. 
10452,1752402,20/7/12,2143931,Amika,"We had a great stay at Angela's B&B style rooms!  Our room was spacious, clean and cheery.  The bathroom was also very clean.  Although the entire three floor house seems to have rooms, we rarely encountered anyone.  Angela and Cass were very accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed (including toothpaste)!

As for the location, it is great and we encountered no problems (even coming home late at night).  Lots of neat restaurants and other areas are within walking distance.   The subway stop is a 5 minute walk away and the ride into midtown Manhattan takes 15 minutes.  All in all, a great place to spend your time in NYC if you are looking to stay somewhere outside of the norm!"
10452,2145931,30/8/12,2829643,Eren,"Everything is fine, silent neighborhood and subway is close to home. Bed is large and Angela is very helpful. Nice to know her."
10452,2213080,6/9/12,2331671,Christoph,"We, three friends, spent entire seven days in that lovely appartement. And in the end we kind of felt like home there. 

* About the appartement: Everything was clean, Angela supplied us with towels, shampoo etc. The kitchen is equipped with everything you might need. If you are travelling in a group of 3 or 4 persons the bedroom could get a little narrow - but because of the huge kitchen which works fine as a living room, we didn't mind.

* About the area/neighborhood: You definitely notice that the area gets slowly gentrified by the folks up from Williamsburg - so you have really nice and hip restaurants around you (--> 'DUN' and 'The Black Swan' are awesome. The distance to the subway is about a five minute walk. There you got trains up to Manhattan and down to JFK and the Rockaway 24/7. But if you are going to do a 'Manhattan trip' you should consider that it takes about 30/40 minutes with the C-Train to places like Times Square or 53rd/5th.

All in all: A lovely appartement in an up and coming area with convenient connections around the clock!"
10452,2298431,16/9/12,621451,Mayra,"Staying at Angela's apartment was great! She kindly waited for us to arrive from a delayed flight at night. Spacious kitchen with everything you need to cook, clean bathroom and cozy bedroom. We stayed 3 people for 9 nights! Lots of space to keep your luggage. The neighborhood is great, silent at night, there's a supermarket and a cozy cafeteria nearby. The subway is only a few blocks away and a 15-20 min ride to Manhattan. If possible I would stay here again. Thank you Angela! :D"
10452,2474026,1/10/12,3588882,Sarah,We had a great time at the B&B style rooms in Brooklyn. It is a save neighborhood. The apartment is clean and you have everything you need. Angela was really helpful with everything and was available 24h. We can just recommend the apartment.

It was clean, comfortable and very close to the subway. In addition, Angela  is a very attentive and generous host. I felt that she tried her best to keep the apartment so pleasant.
Next time in NYC I'll be happy to come back to Angela's."
10452,2934711,21/11/12,2787795,Ryan,"Angela is an extremely attentive host and goes to great lengths to ensure that each of her guests has an enjoyable stay. The room in which I stayed was very spacious and had a walk-in closet with more room for clothing than most any traveler will need.

There's an organic market directly across from the apartment and a larger supermarket 0.2 miles away on Fulton. There's a C line stop just down the street, so it's very convenient to reach Manhattan by subway.

The neighborhood itself was nice. There are a handful of cafes within walking distance, and the people I met were very friendly. I walked home late at night many times and always felt safe.

Overall, highly recommended if you're coming to New York. I'll definitely consider booking again whenever I'm in the area."

The neighbourhood is safe and there is a supermarket nearby and some fastfood joints (I recommend Crown Fried Chicken). Close to Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, which are very nice and close to the subway which will get you to the upper east side in an hour and to downtown manhattan in half an hour. "

We even had access to a small garden which was a nice surprise. 449 Franklin Ave is easily accessible by subway (A and C trains/Franklin Ave stop) either from JFK airport or from Manhattan. So it's very easy and convenient to go to Manhattan or to other places in Brooklyn. 
If we decide to go to NYC again we will definitely try to stay at Angela's place again."

Angela was very helpful on how to get around in the neighbourhood. The room was nice and very private. The neighbourhood might seem a bit rough at first sight but it is safe and you don't have to worry walking home at night. The apartment was clean and in good condition. There are 2 metro stops within walking distance and lots of places to eat.
I'd definitely stay there again if I come to New York. This place has everything you'd want: nice host, large room, very well connected, places to eat out, 24h deli just across the street!"

Angela est là pour vous accueillir, pour répondre à vos questions si besoin.
Des commerces et supermarchés à proximité pour faire ses courses, une salle de sport à 5 min à pied, quelques magasins de vêtements à moins de 10 minutes à pied.

10452,28980655,2/4/15,24167994,Chris,"Welcome to Angela's NYC beginner's Inn. The location is at it's prime and the hostess at Brooklyn's best. Here you will find numerous oversea travellers, some are here for fun, some are taking a shot at the big apple, some already working in New York and we all share drinks around the table. Angela cleans the house almost too much (but that's how we liked it!) and she is super attentive to your needs to make your journey more comfortable. If you want to experience living in Brooklyn, then Angela's place is a good place to start. 

The area is safe, and it comes with two deli grocery convenient stores within 1 min reach. At night it's surprisingly quiet even when Fulton Street comes to life. The fridge has a big enough space for everybody, and there's in-house washer and dryer.

Her apartment was kept incredibly clean- the rooms, bathroom, the kitchen, everything. it was also so close to the subway- literally 2 blocks. It was a wonderful location and not too far from Manhattan. There were also 2 deli stores 10 feet from the front door so that was also sweet deal. Angela was incredibly friendly and cleaned so much of the apartment every week. Truly a fine person to stay with if you're visiting/dropping by New York!! Thanks so much Angela. :) "

That doesn't mean that she wasn't nice, however, as she really did all she could for us to be comfortable. My girlfriend and I stayed very little in the house and did not use the kitchen at any point, but all we had to use was clean and in order. We really appreciated our stay."

She is willing to make your stay really comfortable, every time I asked her for a favour she gave it to me. The room is big and very clean. The location is good, plenty of stores, bars,... and you have a train station really close that in 15min you can get Manhattan. I like the neighbourhood, people are friendly. Overall I would say you won't find anything better at this price. I would recommend Angela's place to everyone. If I come back to NYC I would like to stay at Angela's again 100%. "

We did not get to meet Angela but check-in and out worked fine and she was very quick in answering any questions. 
The apartment is rented out to several people so you share kitchen and bathroom with strangers, but being out the whole day, we didn't really run into each other much.
Make sure to bring earplugs, there is a trafficlight right infront of the house which makes traffic noisy."

From Wms burg back to Park Slope....great.music...GREAT FOOD, and yet quiet on the street.....this is life as it should be. Now couple that with Laurie's expert tips on the neighbourhoods and her son's (Website hidden by Airbnb) cannot be beat! We just finished our holiday and still ...we want to be right back.

10962,38514,27/4/10,69138,Carol,"When you stay at Laurie’s place in Brooklyn’s Park Slope, you end each day of New York fun and exploration by going ‘home’.  It’s warm and welcoming, clean and comfortable, filled with lively art, loads of sun, and is home to 2 beautiful big-eyed cats. This large home is on a quiet street so you aren’t kept awake by street noise, traffic, and lights. Still, it’s close to the action. There are restaurants galore and quick and easy access to Manhattan and other NY areas via all major subway lines. Laurie and Peter are able and eager to advise you on the many attractions and activities in the area and across the city, and the best travel options, to and from.  I’m so glad I found this wonderful and affordable accommodation in New  York where hotels are famously impersonal and over-priced. I’ll be back, for sure. Thanks Laurie and Peter!"
10962,39092,1/5/10,94200,Debra,"To experience the real New York, stay in Brooklyn with Laurie.  Her comfortable, quiet home is full of art, books and music and Laurie is a terrific ambassador for her neighborhood.  Manhattan is a short (15 min.max) ride away on the subway, and there is a ton of great activities right in Brooklyn including the outstanding Brooklyn Museum, Botanical Gardens and many little character bars and restaurants right around the corner from Laurie's place.  Stay here, you'll love it.  Highly recommended."
10962,52430,13/6/10,107823,Ruthellen,Laurie's home was a wonderful respite for us after long fun-filled NYC days. Traveling via subway just a few short blocks from her house got us everywhere we wanted to be with ease. We saw 6 shows in 5 nights and never had any trouble coming home late. The room was spacious and very clean and located on the top floor away from the living areas. There is a private bath and plenty of privacy. Laurie was so welcoming that we quickly felt as if we were visiting a friend. I would highly recommend her rooms to anyone.
10962,63272,11/7/10,68615,Kirsten,"Fabulous!  My family had a great time in New York thanks to Laurie and her wonderful home.  They felt welcome and the fact that she shared all the neighborhood treasures with them was priceless.  The next time we go to New York - we're staying with Laurie!  Thanks Laurie!!

10962,77350,12/8/10,167652,Sabine,"My friend and I had a wonderful week at Laurie's. It's a beautiful house and it really looked like the pictures on here! Laurie's a very friendly and laid back host with lots of good tips and information and materials to look through. Happy with the room, too - this was located next to a lovely bathroom. And the neighbourhood is very nice, too - great brownstone houses and nice coffee places, restaurants and shops, all nearby. As well as Prospect Park - we were lucky to be there for the free Sharon Jones concert. But again - without Laurie we probably wouldn't have known that this was on! Nice fruit salad, croissants and coffee in the morning, Internet access no problem and good chats with Laurie. It was our first time in NY and it was so much nicer to stay privately than in a cheap and nasty hotel room. I can highly recommend staying in Brooklyn and especially with Laurie. (Didn't meet Peter who was in summer camp, but one of the cats was there - super cute!)"

10962,88017,31/8/10,183565,Cheri,"We had a wonderful stay at Laurie's beautiful home in Park Slope, Brooklyn. The beds were very comfortable and we were able to have a washroom and washer/dryer right next door to our room which was very convenient. We would recommend bringing small luggage as the room was on the top floor of a 3 story walkup and the stairwells/hallways are very narrow, navigating that was a bit of a challenge, but that is minor. The subway station was quite close, and it was an easy commute into Manhattan, getting to the upper parts of Manhattan took awhile, but its nice to sit and relax on the air conditioned train after a long, hot day of sightseeing. Laurie was super friendly and helpful, and had many suggestions for things to do and places to see during our stay, it was really nice to have the advice from a local who knows her city! Our only complaint would be having to watch out for the escape artist kitty every time we came back to or left the house, there are two sets of doors at the entrance, but the space between them is very small, and we had to enter and shut the doors one at a time, while trying to keep the kitty away. It was very frustrating and time consuming, and if someone else left the inner door open, it was very hard to keep him from escaping, he got out twice during our visit :(

All in all, it was a very pleasant visit, thanks again for your hospitality Laurie!"
10962,91976,7/9/10,184480,Lucy,"The house is in a great location in Brooklyn - very close to Manhattan via the subway.  The rooms were lovely, quiet and clean - very comfortable beds!  Laurie was such a lovely host, she went out of her way to help us with directions and in deciding what to do out of all the choice there is in NYC!  She even found a bed for us early on the first morning when we arrived after a 32 hour trip! (thanks Peter - love your comic/ book collection). The 2 cats are sweet, as were the squirrels running along the phone lines outside.  And despite Lauries claims that it wasn't at its best, the garden was just gorgeous.
Thanks Laurie!!PS still remember that gluten free bread - was amazing!"

I would only say: ""Home away from home"",Laurie is someone you can fully trust ( and she trusts you) a great host , a great house, a great neighborhood, a great great Prospect park, great public transports etc etc. "
10962,118242,13/10/10,211980,Ingrid,"Laurie is a fabulous, knowledgable host.  She is right there for you to suggest wonderful opportunities to explore Brooklyn and beyond but recedes into her busy life to let you be on your own.  The house is quiet and the neighborhood is amazing.  Lots of places to eat, bistros and the like, and Laurie will steer you in the right direction.  There is wonderful opportunity to meet interesting people that are also staying at Laurie's - I do not think I could have had a better experience or a more affordable opportunity to get the best out of my stay in Brooklyn.  And, if you are a cat lover - Batman and Robin will make the most out of your affection and open door.  "
10962,121199,18/10/10,210512,Juana,"Highly recommend. Location was great. (Park Slope and Brooklyn are wonderful, subway was a few blocks away.) Clean house, comfortable beds, clean bathrooms. Sharing a bathroom with only one other bedroom meant very little/no waiting. Laurie was friendly and helpful. Good breakfast foods on-hand and she gave my husband a great Red Hook breakfast reco. Lots of local guidebooks and maps too, in case you like to digest stuff that way. Already thinking about when we can go back."
10962,135243,8/11/10,255587,Bronwen,"Staying with Laurie was my first experience with AirBnB, and she was an absolutely wonderful host. Her house was lovely, very quiet, and perfectly located. I will definitely be staying with her again if I am ever in New York!"
10962,160349,30/12/10,279416,Christiane,"Our days with Laurie was excellent!

Her house is quite confortable, the room reserved for us was wide enough and spotlessly clean.
Laurie is an excellent person, friendly and a very good tourist guide. She gave us very good tips about Manhathan e Brooklyn. This is an excellent point to stay with her.

The location is excellent too, are just two blocks from Lines D, N, R, F and G subway, with easy access to any part of NY. All types of stores can also be found nearby.

Five stars for our new friend Laurie."
10962,182837,15/2/11,350634,Atul,"Laurie was an excellent host. She knew the neighborhood extremely well and was happy to offer advice on uncrowded cafes for me to work from, as well as restaurants, music halls, and other attractions. The room was comfortable and the house had lots of character--this was my first time using airbnb, and the whole experience felt a lot more authentic than the chain hotels I usually stay at. I'd definitely like to stay here again if I'm in the area.
"
10962,195443,9/3/11,210512,Juana,Great visit. It was our second time. No problems at all. Laurie is helpful and the location can't be beat. Wonderful chocolate croissants!
10962,200570,16/3/11,387342,Christine,"A lovely querky house with lots of history. Laurie is a wonderful host and is so helpful with information on where to eat , where to go, how to get there and avoiding the queues. 
Essential you like cats as Batman and Robin love people.
Once you have learnt the various foibles you can get your own breakfast (delicious) and come and go as you wish, which suited us perfectly and we had a wonderful time. Locally there are some excellent restaurants and wide choice, so no need to head back to Manhattan. An enjoyable place to stay."
10962,217839,5/4/11,309052,Maggie,"Great location, nice clean rooms and excellent shower. Easy walk to subway for 20 min ride into Manhattan."
10962,240262,26/4/11,358848,Marlène,"We spent a fun week with Laurie and Peter and very much appreciated here. The house is situated in a quiet neighborhood with a large choice of restaurants of all nationalities who have been recommended by Laurie. The Ten (Japanese) has been our preference. Too bad we did not meet Laurie and Peter, maybe next time. Still, everything was all set to get a good breakfast and lots of information to a pleasant stay. We had the company of a charming English couple and also we will not forget the two cats who were very sociable. A big thank you to Kim and Dani who helped us provide the best for our stay is in good condition. Finally, a place we strongly recommend to all"
10962,254460,7/5/11,47722,Yvonne,"Laurie is a gracious and very knowledgeable hostess. She knows Brooklyn very well, and she was incredibly helpful in guiding me to the  best places to eat, shop, etc. in the area. I stayed at her place while waiting for my husband to arrive from the West Coast; we just moved into the area, and Laurie made the initial transition much easier. She also has delicious croissants and cheeses available for her guests!"
10962,321119,18/6/11,488247,Ephraim,"Our stay at Laurie's is probably the best experience one could ever imagine through Airbnb.  Laurie is an amazing host, a knowledgeable tour guide of New York, and a museum curator all in one.  Her home is in a great part of the city, yet on a side street where I never had a problem parking just a few feet from her front door.  Her house could be a Better Homes and Garden showpiece, and yes, it even has a large garden in her back yard.  There is artwork and books everywhere.  In fact, the photos on Airbnb don't even do justice to the beauty of the place.  The rooms are large, immaculate, and the beds are comfortable.  The espresso maker in the kitchen and fresh croissants and OJ every morning was a treat, and much better than even Starbucks can deliver!  The house management team, Batman and Robin (Laurie's two cats), were friendly and ever-present.  I couldn't think of a nicer place to stay.  "
10962,402368,28/7/11,657509,Anne,"It was great to stay in Laurie's well situated and welcoming home in South Slope.  Laurie was so welcoming to our family of four, and never failed to give us spot on advice for our queries on eating out, places to visit and things to do.  Her home is comfortable and gracious and a joy to returw to air-conditioned rooms in the middle of a heat wave! "
10962,494882,2/9/11,7048,Alessandra,"Laurie is great, lovely and welcoming. The place was really nice and with an easy access to the town. Will definetely recommend to my friends and be back! I really felt home there :-)"
10962,553039,21/9/11,478901,Christine,"My husband and I stayed with Laurie and her beautiful cats for a week in September. We had a fantastic stay and Laurie couldn’t have been more helpful or generous. Brooklyn was a great place to stay and Laurie’s house was close to great restaurants and the subway for easy access to Manhattan. Laurie is a fabulous host and her home was like a home away from home. A wonderful retreat in a great city! Thanks Laurie, I would love to come back. "
10962,596245,4/10/11,639407,Antje,"We really enjoyed our stay at Laurie Kellogg's house. The bedroom was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was clean too.We enjoyed great coffee,bagels and muffins and fresh fruit for breakfast.Laurie did everything to make us feel comfortable and gave us a lot of information about the restaurants and sightseeing in New York.She even gave us discount coupons for certain restaurants and activities(biking in Central Park).This is a great place to stay!"
10962,645241,19/10/11,1165795,Trish,"Staying with Laurie was the best part of our wonderful 6 day trip.  The entire house was very clean.  We loved our cozy room and our bed was really comfortable.  A nice variety of croisants, bagels and cheeses and that awesome expresso machine (!) made for a yummy breakfast. Every evening we felt like we were coming home.  Never felt like that staying in a hotel.  And meeting Laurie was the best part of (Website hidden by Airbnb) interesting woman who is a concierge from heaven!
We'll be back."
10962,657663,24/10/11,1097914,Will,Laurie was an excellent host.  The house and neighborhood were lovely. Laurie was always ready to help my girlfriend and I find our way around town. She showed us lots of great places to eat out and areas to tour which were very affordable. Be sure to try her awesome breakfast with organic orange juice and fresh croissants!  I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a great vacation in NYC.
10962,731948,20/11/11,929275,Ashley,"HEAVEN!!!! If you""re reading this, then chances are you're in a pickle as to where to stay In New York, without having to blow your budget or take out a mortgage. You've possibly used airbnb before, and had average or bad or great experiences. You're asking yourself questions like.... Will the house and room be quiet, will it be close to subways, is it in a good area, will I have my privacy, will my host be able to help me find my way around, will my bed be comfortable, and if I wanna come home at 2 am wi after exploring the city, willll it be safe?. Well I just spent ten days of bliss at a house that was more like a home, a host that was more like a friend, in an area that couldn't be better situated. Look no further If you want a real home away from home at a great price in a great area!! Checklist. The R train is a few bllocks away, I used it to get everywhere and connect with every possible subway. You can walk in the area 24 hours with complete peace of mind. Laurie's house is on the corner of the hottest hippest liveliest street with tons of shops cafes restaurants a market and more, so u don't even have to go to Manhattan every day. You are so close to everything that you can explore every part of Brooklyn, and if u do have time and feel like a good brisk exciting walk while taking in the amazing sights oif Brooklyn,you will get you to the Brooklyn bridge, and over it i in 45.  miin. If you cycle, 2o min to Manhattan, and 10 min by subway.. So you're in the best area of New York, trust me!!! As far as the rrest of the checklist? Best bed ever, most beautiful home filled with life and history and art, quiet, tranquil, private, inhabited by the cutest cats ever, who on more than one occasion spent hours sleeping in with me one sunday after a rather late night. If I tell you I didn't hear a peep in the house I'm not lying, as the rooms are situated on the top of the beautiful house, and the apartment for rental is below and completely private and seperate from the rest of the house. The rooms have just been redecorated and spruced up for Christmas, and are truly the largest nicest rooms you could find in New York for the excellent price. I stayed on a little longer and Laurie was incredibly accomodating. She is an excpetional woman, mother and human being, intelligent talented resourceful and just sweeter than you could imagine. so don't look any further BOOK, before its all booked up!"
10962,754610,29/11/11,292620,Diane,"We enjoyed staying at Laurie's and wished that we had more time chatting with her and scouring through her books.  She's very flexible, friendly and always ready to share her knowledge of the area.  The apartment is near to the subways as well as little cafes, restaurants, supermarkets and 24 hour pharmacy!

Both Batman and Robin (Laurie's pet cats) are simply adorable and very friendly too!  Will miss them!  "

I give Laurie's my highest recommendation."
10962,831343,3/1/12,1316869,Marlies,"Thanks to Laurie, she was a wonderful host. Her cats were lovely. We arrived very late at night and she was waiting for us! Lovely house. The room was very cosy and the beds were perfect. The bathroom we had to share with other guests was no problem. Towels, shampoo etc. all was there. Great shower. Breakfast was complete. We even might take a peace of fruit for the lunch. In the evening when coming back from sightseeing we were allowed to take a cup of tea or a glas of wine, so nice. Using her computer for the internet was also possible. Laurie gave us a lot of information about New York. The area where she lives is really safe. Very easy to walk about 5 minutes to the closest subway. With the subway it took about 20 minutes to be in the centre of Manhatten. We advice her appartement to anyone who goes to NY. 
thanks Laurie."
10962,870590,18/1/12,1541283,Peter,"I had a pleasant, easy stay.  All the food basics were provided, especially for breakfast.  Dinner was also provided some nights.  Bringing in my own food was also allowed.  I could go out and come in at odd hours without disturbing anyone."
10962,1301773,19/5/12,1515502,Flor,"We had a really nice time in Brooklyn. Laurie Kellogg is a magnificent host. She gives a lot of tips and useful advice about things to see & do, good restaurants, bars, subway schedules, ... We stayed in a room with double bed on the top floor: a quiet place to sleep. It's a house with a history... lots of books, pictures and drawings. A bit messy but really cosy. We felt at home immediately. Laurie can also provide breakfast if needed: organic orange juice, croissants & fruits. We enjoyed it a lot! Thanks Laurie for such a wonderful stay!"
10962,1334983,23/5/12,2057547,Colin,"     There are homes and there are homes. Some look like a House Beautiful photo spread, but do not have heart. Others are living breathing expressions of their owner's creativity and vitality. 
     I am not going to waste your time with a catalogue of the amenities which were all first-class all the way (special mention, however, to the superb coffee and croissants and the lush towels, and the comfortable beds and the generous showers and the warm inviting old wood floors that glowed under the lights ).  
     Rather, I prefer to share that this home is a true oasis in a busy city, one that nourishes the soul with real artists' art, with personable cats, with conversation, with books that reflect Laurie's expansive interests.  This grand old house presents a gracious hospitality to all who visit. 
     Laurie is a wealth of information about the heartbeat of the city outside her door, and is responsive to your every request.  All of the above at a reasonable rate, you can't go wrong. 
Thanks Laurie,
Colin"
10962,1374557,29/5/12,2214980,Joan,"We were delighted with our stay at Laurie's place. Her home is as warm and beautiful as the pix show. The area has a real feel of community about it and Laurie gave us invaluable advice on where to eat and find Jazz. We would heartily recommend this as a great place to stay, whether Brooklyn is your final destination or if, like us, NYC is where it is at!
Looking forward to returning,
Joan."
10962,1523680,20/6/12,2394693,Kris,"My stay at Laurie's home was delightful!  Park Slope is such a great neighborhood, and Laurie helped me to find good restaurants and things to do nearby.  She really loves Park Slope and New York, and makes sure that her guests have the info they need to have a rich and vivid experience while in town.  I arrived way too early from a red eye flight, and Laurie was very gracious to let me wait in her living room and get settled in as soon as the room was ready.  Staying in a home versus a hotel is just what I needed on my business trip, and the location is superb... close to transit, close to Prospect Park for much needed walks and quiet moments.  This will the be the first place I search for when I'm in town next and I'm really grateful I found it."

It was my first time in New York and all the advice and information she shared was extremely helpful and valuable. Her house is conveniently situated near a subway station with great connections. This gave me easy access to everything I wanted to see - only 20 minutes to Manhattan. All in all, it was a pleasure staying with Laurie and her very handsome son, Peter.  "

10962,2040795,20/8/12,2916687,Luis,"Laurie´s place is all about care and details. I flet like home. I have really enjoyed mi time in Brooklyn. This house is awesome and very well located, near to Prospect Park and the aera is full of good restaurents and bars with live music and it is very easy to go to Manhattan by subway. I recommend Laurie´s house for your NYC vacation. Laurie was professional, very friendly and a wonderful host giving recommendations for my stay in Brooklyn. She also led me her bike for enjoying a beatiful day in Governors Island.

Looking forward to returning.

10962,2302243,17/9/12,2973639,Ronnie,Laurie was informative as to places to eat in area as well as transportation needs.  Home has a very lived in feel.  Room was comfortable with the use of the air conditioner.  Sharing the bathroom was not a problem as I left early in morning most days.  
10962,2359402,21/9/12,2829819,Liezl,"We had a great stay at Laurie's place - it was perfect for all our needs. Park Slope is a great neighborhood, nice and quiet too, and Laurie's house is close to 3 very convenient subway lines. Laurie was very helpful in telling us where the best local places are for pizza, bagels etc. Not that we ever actually went out for bagels in the end - Laurie had the most amazing bagels, cream cheese and orange juice I have ever tasted!! "
10962,2421384,26/9/12,3436627,Beej,"Laurie is a terrific person. Knowledgeable, helpful, good taste and extremely warm. 

Gorgeous house doesn't go far enough as a description. Comfortable, clean, private and spacious. We had no idea that we could feel so at home in a foreign country. Brooklyn is amazing, the people are friendly and fun and helpful. The trains are all very close. Laurie's coffee maker is awesome. 

It is my opinion that there is no better way to stay in NYC.  

We had an unbelievable time. Simply immaculate!"
10962,2570044,10/10/12,2619301,Seth,"laurie's 140+ glowing reviews can't be wrong! she's got a gorgeous house with a fantastic setup in a perfect location. she's proud to call brooklyn home and is passionate about sharing the things she finds special about her city and her borough. listen to her recommendations; she knows what she's talking about! 

garden/backyard space is virtually unheard of in new york and laurie's got a truly beautiful back patio and garden. take advantage of relaxing out there with your morning coffee if weather permits!

park slope is an adorable neighborhood and a welcome respite from the over-stimulation of manhattan. being so close to so many great restaurants, markets, shops and the park should sell you on this place if nothing else has.

bottom line: if you're looking for an alternative to a standard (Hidden by Airbnb) -type place and want the opportunity to stay with someone who's as invested in you enjoying your trip as you are, laurie's what you're looking for!"
10962,2631552,16/10/12,3401266,Nicole,"Great location conveniently located within 4 blocks of the subway and two stops of transfers, coffee joints, restaurants and even a wonderful patisserie.  Venture a little further by foot or train and find a plethora of boutiques, eats, bars and BAM (a Brooklyn gem!)

Laurie is warm and welcoming as is her lovely home.  Coffee and breakfast snacks were a plus and the conversation was priceless. The shared bath was no problem and had a hair dryer, the house is quiet and the bed was comfortable.  You'll have access to countless maps, area menus and suggestions for things to do and places to go.  Help and smiles are available when you need but never intrusive.  Will stay again next time I return.  Thank you Laurie!"
10962,2784634,2/11/12,3482161,Etsuko,"Laurie treated us like her family during our stay when we got hit by Hurricane Sandy. We felt very protected at her house that never lost power. Park Slope is a wonderful neighborhood to stay and stroll. Lots of great restaurants and shops on 5th and 7th Avenues which are all in walking distance from the house, but still it's very quiet.  We never got bored when we couldn't reach Manhattan. Great organic breakfast foods in the fridge, fancy espresso machine,  and beautiful art work everywhere in the house. Above all, Laurie is a very warm hearted hostess we can count on."
10962,3049918,9/12/12,3778619,Carol,"Laurie's home was the perfect place for my nine days in Brooklyn. I was visiting my daughter/husband/and baby who live just a few blocks away. It was nice to come ""home"" to a quiet/comfy room after a long, busy day. It was also wonderful to have breakfast and coffee every morning. Right after I arrived she texted me to find out what I liked for breakfast. Plus, she has a wonderful espresso machine. Laurie was a great host. We only crossed paths a few times, which was fine, but she keeps in touch to make sure your stay is going well. Thank you Laurie!

10962,3147420,24/12/12,4146321,Emma,"You would have to be crazy not to stay with Laurie! Five stars is not enough. My fiancée and I had a fantastic time in New York thanks to Laurie. We hadn't done any prior planning when we arrived and she helped us with our itinerary, gave us tips for restaurants and experiences and showed us the REAL soul of New York. When attending a recommended, very special intimate jazz performance in Harlem the person next to us commented it was amazing to see us there because most locals don't even know about it! That is exactly the kind of experience you will get staying with Laurie!
Her home is very clean and comfortable and we felt very welcome there. At the same time you were given plenty of space and freedom to do as you please. Breakfast is indulgently catered. Location is unbeatable and we had NO problems getting back home and felt safe even late at night. Laurie is a generous host and we would love to stay with her again!"
10962,3638249,26/2/13,5118001,Erin,"I had a wonderful, comfortable and educational stay at Laurie's bnb!
The spacious 4 story house is beautiful and has so much character that you just can't spend enough time looking at everything, especially all the art work! The Almond croissants in the morning were delectable and Laurie always has great advice to give about how to get to different places and where to go in Brooklyn to see the best french musician, at a secret little place that not many know about!
Thanks Laurie!"
10962,3736458,10/3/13,4728518,Liss,"Laurie's house is beautiful--open, full of wonderful art and cozy. It is in a safe neighborhood, near the subway and Prospect Park. She was a thoughtful host--I recommend her to anyone."

10962,6710975,22/8/13,7226090,Maria And Karim,"Laurie is more than a Hostess. she is a city guide, a friend and a mother! she took care of us with so much love and she help us move around town with incredible suggestions about places to visit (like the Brooklyn Museum, forget about the MET!) and great places to eat. Her son Peter is always willing to give you a hand and her two cats are so full of love and tenderness. 

The house is great, just as you see it on the photographs, which was a great relief for us. 

we had a great time and we felt at home all the time."

10962,8816409,19/11/13,9320356,Barry,"For me Laurie and her house was perfect. Located between the film festival I was attending and the gym, I couldn't have asked for a better location. Plus I got the use of the kitchen so I saved money by cooking for one or two meals a day. There were markets close by and even 99 cent stores for the razors, tooth brush and gym lock I forgot to bring. Laurie lent me an umbrella when I needed it. She's very cool and mothering. I also love her adorable, friendly cats, Batman and Robin. The whole experience was very relaxed and comfortable with that homey and eclectic feeling. There's wonderful art all over the house from her family and friends and a two too narrow creaky staircases which led to my adorable room. I liked the bathroom as well which allowed me good lighting to prepare for my nights out. Laurie also helped me navigate the subways with instruction and maps and recommend her friendly and efficient car service. Nearby is the Brooklyn museum which had the most awesome John Paul Gaultier fashion show and of course there's Manhattan which is incredible for exploring only a subway ride away. I hope to stay there again!"
10962,8895423,25/11/13,5667157,Tessa,"Laurie's home is warm and welcoming and so is Laurie. We liked the relaxed atmosphere, and the delicious croissants and yoghurt / cereal for breakfast every day. The house is in an elegant tree lined street close to the subway, and the cafes, food stores and interesting shops on 5th and 7th avenues. We found good coffee just round the corner at Cafe Regular on 11th st. Loved  the margaritas at Rachel's taqueria, and the jazz duo at Oliviers ...both recommended by Laurie. The F train took us directly to Manhattan. It was ideal to start our time in NY in a more low key way in Park Slope. Thank you Laurie!"
10962,9166152,10/12/13,9876329,Peter And Susan,"We had a perfect four day stay at Laurie's wonderful Park Slope home -- close to the F Train to Manhattan, great restaurants and cafes nearby, and the world's friendliest cats.  Even found the perfect parking space right across the street!  We'll definitely be back."
10962,9275394,17/12/13,9704497,Amelia,"A great space in a great neighborhood, right near 5th ave shops and restaurants.  My stay with Laurie was lovely -- she even made sure I had breakfast every morning before I left her house.  A clean, quiet and sun filled room were perfect after long days spent in the city.  I really enjoyed looking at the beautiful artwork on the walls, too.  Laurie is extremely knowledgable about the city and even had a list of holiday windows she recommended seeing on my trip!  I recommend this place to fellow travelers."
10962,9588565,3/1/14,4913081,Pam,"Laurie was a gracious hostess who not only gave us helpful tips about how to enjoy the New York experience, but also provided fresh bagels and croissants every morning.  The bedroom was clean, the neighborhood environment was quiet and safe, and the bed was very comfortable.  We stayed on the top floor of her home and shared a bath with a lovely woman and her daughter visiting from the Netherlands.  Staying with Laurie was one of the highlights of our holiday trip to New York!"
10962,9884862,17/1/14,3931764,Prue,"Croissants, cats and comfy bed. Laurie promises the best almond croissants you've ever tasted and she delivers. Batman and Robin, the cats, will nap with you if desired. My room, overlooking the garden, had one of those foam tops so I sank into it as if embraced. Great coffee on tap. Sun pouring in through the windows overlooking the garden. Some great suggestions from Laurie - things you wouldn't find on your own. Short walk to the subway. Quiet street near lots of cafes and shops. "
10962,10530138,24/2/14,9500970,Hiten,"Laurie is friendly, kind, and an great host. I was there for work and felt completely at ease going in and out as I pleased. It was great having an opportunity to communicate and chat with the other guests from Germany and the USA. Location is awesome. Room has everything you need. 

The bagels with cream cheese were awesome. "
10962,11221267,25/3/14,8629481,Peter,"Laurie and Chavi made us feel very welcome, and the room was perfectly situated for a trip to Brooklyn. We were out nearly all of the time so did not make much use of the breakfast, but it was great to know it was available, and the whole place was very homey - a real find in Brooklyn. In particular, given the extreme weather, the room was warm, the beds were clean and comfy and the cats very welcoming too. Would recommend this room to anyone who wants a home from home experience."

Batman and Robin to save us in case of disaster ! thank you Laurie for this nice week in yOur lOvely hOme  !"
10962,13239926,23/5/14,2987312,Anne-Marie,"We hebben genoten van de warme gastvrijheid van Laurie! Ze maakte tijd voor ons en haar tips hebben zeker bijgedragen aan ons heerlijke verblijf in 'the Big Apple'. Het huis staat in een prima buurt, vlakbij winkels, restaurants en metro. Wij (twee vrouwen) voelden ons veilig in de buurt en gingen dus ook zonder problemen 's avonds nog op pad voor een restaurantbezoek. Vervoer vanuit JFK naar het huis van Laurie is een dingetje. Shuttlediensten rijden niet naar Brooklyn. Openbaar vervoer vonden wij vanwege het overstappen met koffers geen goed plan. Taxibedrijf Eastern wordt door Laurie aanbevolen. Echter, je kunt alleen vooraf reserveren als je een mobiel met USA-nummer hebt. Bleef voor ons de Yellow Cab over. De Yellow Cab die wij namen gaf $62 aan op de meter, veel meer dan het vaste tarief van $35 van Eastern. Oplossing: bel als je op JFK aankomt met een public phone gratis naar Eastern via (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) . Dan zou een taxi na ongeveer 20 minuten arriveren. Weer even bellen als het wat langer duurt. Wel goed aangeven waar je staat :-). Verder adviseer ik de minder mobiele gasten het appartement te huren in de souterrain. De andere twee kamers zijn namelijk op zolder en daarvoor moet je 2,5 flinke steile trappen op. Alles bij elkaar zijn we erg enthousiast over ons verblijf bij Laurie: we komen graag terug!"

Es un sitio muy tranquilo y está muy cerca del Metro y de Manhattan. Ella fue muy gentil en las mañanas al ofrecernos un delicioso café con croissants y frutas.
Muchas gracias Laurie.

The cats Batman and Robin are very hospitable, too. The house is very comfortable and clean, and the neighborhood is nice and safe. Make sure to check out the childrenbooks illustrated by Steven Kellogg!"
10962,18738836,31/8/14,10756996,Bettina Freischem,"Ich habe zwei Wochen bei Laurie gewohnt und die Zeit dort sehr genossen.
Es ist ein wunderbares, altes gemütliches Haus in Brooklyn, mit vielen Kunstwerken ( auch von ihrem Vater, der ein bekannter Kinderbuch-Illustrator war ) und unzähligen Büchern.
Die Nachbarschaft ist freundlich und schön und zur Subway nach Manhattan sind es nur wenige Schritte.
Laurie ist bestens informiert über alles, was in New York vor sich geht und gibt einem tolle Tips.
Bei meinem nächsten Aufenthalt in New York werde ich auf jeden Fall gerne zu Laurie zurückkehren."
10962,19510322,14/9/14,8629844,David,The location is great for doing things in Brooklyn. We were warmly greeted and found the accommodations very comfortable. The shared bath on our floor was with just 1 other person. We slept well and it was easy to help ourselves to breakfast on our early schedule. We enjoyed visiting with Laurie and her assistant. We anticipate on staying here again in the spring.
10962,21118545,12/10/14,12664843,Rob,"We hebben een fijne tijd gehad in New York/Brooklyn. Het mooie huis van Laurie ligt in een rustige buurt met volop restaurantjes op loopafstand. De subway is binnen 10 minuten te bereiken. Tevens is er een mooi park in de buurt. De twee persoonskamer met gedeelde badkamer was prima. Groot genoeg voor twee personen. Ontbijt konden we zelf maken en was heerlijk met croissants, zoete broodjes, yoghurt, gewoon brood en fruit.
Laurie was erg behulpzaam en had vele goede tips over New York en Brooklyn. En de poezen waren gezellig aanwezig."
10962,21623449,20/10/14,1109531,Mel + Mike,"Laurie was awesome! Gave great directions, was communicative and honest about the place. The room was as described and the beds were comfy. The neighbourhood is beautiful and has a lot of cute restaurants, shops and dwellings. "
10962,22246547,2/11/14,4016181,Charlotte,"The perfect experience: very clean (amazing shower- hot and powerful), very well situated, extremely generous host, very beautiful home. We feel already a bit nostalgic, loved the cats, the garden, the delicious teas and enormous toasts for breakfast. Also, not only will Laurie happily explain how to get around, but she will provide excellent addresses for food and good tips for cultural outtings. Full library of New York magazines, guides, as well as lots of flyers to guide you around this very nice area and generally NYC. She really does a lot to help you and it makes it so unique. So cool about the open flexible check-in check-out time: no arrival time plus we could leave our bags for the day of our departure and , and it helped a lot. Thank you for everything Laurie! "
10962,22521691,9/11/14,16991619,Isabel,"We had a great week at Lauries. The house was very homey and the bedroom very comfortable.  Laurie also provides some breakfast in the mornings, to fuel up for a days sightseeing. The two cats will also be there to keep you company! 

Brooklyn is a great place to visit and you could easily spend a week alone just seeing that district. Luckily Laurie was able to provide us with some great suggestions which were well worth listening to! 

The house is close to great bars and restaurants on 5th ave and a number of subway lines only a few minutes walk away.  We were lucky enough to catch the nyc marathon whilst we were there and enjoyed the rest of the city too! 

Thanks Laurie for a great trip! "
10962,23555981,4/12/14,6177790,Claudia,"I booked this pretty place for four nights and ended up staying five.  I really enjoyed myself there and felt very comfortable.  Laurie was very accommodating while my plans kept changing--first there were two of us coming, then just one, then whoops, two for a while, just one for the rest, etc.  The house looks exactly as depicted--pretty, full of light, full of color, and full of interesting things collected with an artist's eye.  I really enjoyed the illustrations from famous children's book authors, including Laurie's own father.  The bed was very comfortable, the water pressure great, everything clean and nicely thought out.  Laurie is very interesting and I really enjoyed my conversations with her.  Oh and the house is just a few blocks to the subways that go into Manhattan quickly and easily.  There is also lots to explore in the pretty neighborhood (good food too, which Chavi and Laurie can point you toward).  I ended up sleeping the extra night in the downstairs garden apartment--also very comfortable and inviting.  I was ready to move in.  I would definitely go back to Laurie's house.  I felt like a happy houseguest staying with interesting friends."
10962,23895412,14/12/14,21555365,Luc,"The house is absolutely stunning, tastefully arranged, with plenty of space, natural light and tons of character. A true home away from home.

South Slope is a beautiful and quiet, historic residential neighbourhood and a pleasure to walk about even in gloomy weather, of which we unfortunately got a fair share. This is unavoidable this time of the year though - a clear incentive to come back when it gets warmer!

Laurie was a wonderful host. She provided us with a variety of suggestions and advice regarding our sightseeing choices and - it must be said - we owe a great part of our most unforgettable memories (live music in particular) to Laurie's local knowledge - and her willingness to share it!

I would definitely recommend Laurie's place to anyone looking for a NYC experience with a homely touch."

Laurie has a lot of great tips on where to go and how to get there. The two cats are so cute and really made my day. If you are staying in one of the rooms, keep in mind that the bathroom is shared with the other guest and that the kitchen is shared with Laurie.  "

The room was big and very nice,and the bed was very comfortable which is one of the main things when you book a room. Laurie is a gentle host and it is always available to help you with reccomendations about the city. If you're not staying in Manhattan that is the perfect place to go for sure."

She is incredibly knowledgable about her fabulous neighbourhood and provides guests a very helpful guide that suggests local restaurants and music venues.  I have stayed in Park Slope many times and love the neighbourhood.  I stayed in one of the upstairs bedrooms for part of my stay, and I also rented the downstairs apartment when my husband arrived.   Both were exactly as advertised and both were very comfortable.  I highly recommend staying in Park Slope at Laurie's wonderful home.

Es gibt auch ein Booklett, in dem Tipps für Lokale und Sehenswürdigkeiten in der näheren oder weiteren Umgebung aufgelistet sind. Es wäre hilfreich, wenn die Anhänge an die Mails verlässlich beim Empfänger ankämen. Das Frühstück ist wirklich vielfältig und reichlich. Außerdem kann man immer nehmen, was man möchte. Laurie war zwar nicht oft persönlich anzutreffen, aber immer erreichbar und kümmerte sich per Mail um uns. Als Ruhepol eignet sich die Gegend und das Haus ausgezeichnet. "

10962,77900828,4/6/16,2602476,Macarena & Tomás,"La casa está situada en un barrio en Brooklyn, muy cerca del metro, lo que hace fácil el traslado a Manhattan. La pieza que elegimos (dos camas angostas) está en el tercer piso, lo que es bueno tener en cuenta para personas con poca movilidad o maletas muy pesadas!, también este piso es el más caluroso. El resto de la casa es linda pero es mucho más ordenada en las fotos que en la realidad, realmente se siente como la casa de una artista! La pieza estaba ordenada y limpia y el baño también. El jardín es muy bonito y preferimos tomar desayuno ahí, que además era muy rico. 
A pesar de que vimos poco a Laurie, ella trató de ayudarnos en lo que pudo, solucionar el tema del calor y darnos excelentes datos sobre el barrio y alrededores.  Muchas gracias! "

The room is spacious, and nicely furnished like the rest of the house. 
I felt safe in the area and was happy that I chose Brooklyn to stay - really nice bars and affordable places to have lunch or dinner. 
Also connections with the fast trains was convenient. In a nutshell: I would stay with Laurie again and highly recommend!"

The room was air conditioned (absolutely necessary in New York summer time!) and perfectly comfortable. I didn't run into Laurie until my second morning in the place as our schedules didn't overlap, but I had everything I needed anyway, and once we did get a chance to chat she was warm and friendly and interesting."

Unica pecca, al nostro arrivo purtroppo Laurie non c'era e ci hanno accolto due ospiti, ma che comunque hanno saputo essere gentili e disponibili. 
Laurie è arrivata verso il termine della nostra vacanza e anche lei è stata davvero disponibile con noi, peccato non averla conosciuta meglio! 
In ogni caso consigliamo vivamente casa di Laurie, che per quel poco che abbiamo avuto a che fare si è rivelata una persona davvero carina! Un abbraccio da Roma e grazie di tutto!!"

The location is quite good, F train
goes to central directly, there are many nice restaurants,cafes and Prospect park nearby. If you have cat allergies, I don't recommend you to stay here. We stayed third floor, the cat came into our room every morning. Laurie is great host. Thank you so much once again! :)"

This neighborhood couldn't have been any better, easy walking to the subway, neighborhood restaurants and shops.  A family neighborhood, felt perfectly safe, even late at night coming back from the subway.  When I go back to Brooklyn, I'm hoping I can make my home away from home at Laurie's beautiful home."

10962,107658406,11/10/16,25837941,Jennifer,"Staying with Laurie was one of the best Airbnb experience we ever had! Not like other Airbnb host that you will never meet, the room that is perfectly organized which made you feel like a hotel room, Laurie is there for you, she talks to you, we shared our stories, opinions, laughed together, listened to the presidential debates together, it all makes us feel like visiting a family relative in NYC rather than staying thousands miles away from home knowing nothing and no one; the house is spacious, artistic, Laurie put all her stuff in the house(without segregation to the guests) without putting extra effort to make them look good or fancy but you can easily feel the artistic yet homy atmosphere, the moment you walk into the door you will feel like I'm home, again!Not mentioning the unlimited juice, yoghurt and cream cheese(with scallions! Perfect match with bagels, Yummy! Laurie will always think that you put too less cheesy on the bagel, do put as much as possible, American way! ;) ) available to you.
I think Laurie is the best representative of what the best Airbnb can bring about: share, trust, good taste and human!"
10962,109052162,19/10/16,60788701,Andrea,"Me and my 19 year old daughter spent one week at Laurie`s place in Brooklyn. Laurie really made us feel comfortable and gave us good tipps for our stay in NY. The house is great and we had our privacy even though other poeple were around at some times. 
The rooms were clean, shampoo and hairdryer were offered. 
Around the corner, on the 5th Av, we got everything for our needs. 
The neighbourhood was safe. In about a few minutes we got to the substation and in about 20 Minutes we got to Manhattan. We took the train until 11 `clock p.m. When coming back later on, we took a taxi, the prices were reasonable. Thank you Laurie for offering us a great breakfast (Bagels, yummie cream cheese, Orangejuice and Coffee) We didn`t take it for granted. We enjoyed our stay that much. At the end, the booklet is great and very helpful. Thank you so much.

I would recommend this airbnb for folks not familiar with the area, as Lori has lots of tips and suggestions for tourists. 
The only negative about my stay was in the middle of the night when a cat scratched at my door and woke me up with meowing- only a sore spot for me because I am not a cat person! Just happened the one time though, and I was able to fall right back asleep. Maybe this is something you sign up for when booking an airbnb with cats :) 
Thanks for a nice stay, Laurie!"

The main floor is cozy and warm, where, besides interacting with other interesting guests, you find the host welcome you and try to make you feel comfortable.

Outside - Park slope, is among the top neighborhoods in New York City: 5-10 minutes walk to the prospect park, 15-20 minutes walk to the barclays center/downtown brooklyn, two blocks away to the nearby subway stations and Manhattan is 20 minutes away by train."

Die Wohnlage ist für Unternehmungen in Brooklyn und Manhattan günstig. Auch gut von JFK zu erreichen. Die Lage ist ruhig. In der Umgebung sind gute Restaurants zu finden. Sehr schön ist ein Booklet, das Laurie vorab zur Information zusendet. Uns hat es insgesamt sehr gut gefallen.

10962,149683027,5/5/17,30454993,Grant,"Staying at Laurie's lovely home in Brooklyn was what the Air B and B experience is all about, at least for me. Easy and clear instructions upon arrival and a feeling of being a welcome guest in a lovely home in Park Slope Brooklyn. Laurie is a busy person but always available if needed to provide guests with advice and assistance. My room was pleasant and quiet and the bed extremely comfortable. The bathroom always had hot water and was shared by guests in the second room on the floor but that was never an issue for me. Laurie always made sure there was plenty of bagels, croissants, cereal, and of course the delicious coffee. Subway is five minutes walk. There's plenty to see and do in Brooklyn and the area is a pleasure to simply wander around. I recommend a visit to the vast Brooklyn Green Wood cemetery if you feel like a ramble in a quiet and beautiful space only twenty minutes walk from Laurie's house. 
As if all this wasn't enough there is Laurie's pretty garden at the back with tables and chairs for guests to enjoy sitting out. I couldn't have asked for more as it was the perfect spot for me to do tai chi each morning.
If I am fortunate enough to return to New York I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else but with Laurie in her warm and welcoming book filled home."

10962,154017331,22/5/17,6127275,Caroline,"We had such a great stay at Laurie's place. We booked kind of last minute but Laurie was very quick to answer.
She sent us a booklet With a lot of information about her place and the places to see around and in New York and restaurants suggestions, it was perfect!
The place is near the metro that took us directly to the places we wanted to visit in Manhattan or Brooklyn but there are also great places to see nearby (Prospect Park).
The room was perfect, quiet, we shared the bathroom with the people in the room next to ours which was not a problem at all. Everything was very clean.
We arrived late at the airport but had no trouble getting in the house and into our room.
I would definitely recommend!!"

This is a great location for a visit to Brooklyn, the lovely Park Slope part of Brooklyn, or it is only an easy subway ride to Manhattan.  Laurie's home is warm & welcoming!"

10962,177690781,3/8/17,8860330,Arielle,"Laurie's place has character and charm, and the garden is a lovely place to enjoy coffee and breakfast. My friend and I stayed in the room with twin beds, which is on the top floor next to the shared bathroom. The space upstairs is, like most living spaces in this neighborhood, quite small. 
	While Laurie is formally welcoming, I felt as if I were clearly sharing her day-to-day living space. When booking here, be aware that the artsy open living space downstairs is not available in the evenings and, although open to access during the day, does not feel like a ""hang out"" space. We did not feel comfortable spending time in any space other than our private room and the garden.
	Finally, our communication with Laurie was very confusing. I found the listing to be highly detailed yet unclear. I wanted to clarify it, but was unable to ask questions before booking, and was actually required to enter all my information in order to communicate at all and “apply” for the room. My application for the reservation was then automatically (and unexpectedly) “accepted,” paid for and subject to her cancellation rules! If you cannot clarify which room you will be booking in advance of payment, do not book here. 
	Warning: two days before our stay, Laurie informed us there was a mix up with double booking another guest. She offered for us to stay in a different listed room, as well as what used to be her son’s room, at first expecting us to pay a small amount for the inconvenience. When we stated we wanted to remain in the room we had booked, she heavily pressured us to wait until arrival and see what else she had to offer. She only backed off and worked it out with the other guest when we threatened to cancel our reservation."

10962,208256787,31/10/17,145224719,Coen,"Laurie's house is a cosy, comfortable, and safe place in one of New York City's more laid back areas (Park Slope).

For the price Laurie's place is a no-brainer, I think you will be hard-pressed to get better value for your money. The house is situated in the Park Slope area and places of interest such a Prospect Park and the Barclay's Center are easily accessible via public transport and even on foot. The house itself is older but in excellent condition (although those stairs are a bit noisy at night) and it has a beautiful garden with terrace that's great to enjoy a sunny day in.

Laurie is quick and elaborate in responding to any requests or questions I had, on site before my stay and whilst staying with her. Any questions I asked about the area were met with detailed answers and tips for traveling and eating out cheaply. She also gave me overall money saving tips to enjoy as many things as I could in New York. I could tell she has been living in the area for a long time and is both very knowledgeable as well as enthusiastic about conveying that to her guests.

I had a great time staying at Laurie's place as she is an excellent host who really went the extra mile to make my stay as comfortable as possible. This was my first AirBnB experience and it has certainly left a good impression on me as a valid alternative to hotels. I heartily recommend Laurie's place to anyone wanting to visit New York City and/or Park Slope or surrounding areas."

Laurie gibt tolle Tipps, organisiert Taxi zum Flughafen, hat booklet mit insider tipps, also da bleiben keine Fragen offen. Frühstück macht man sich selbst, die Küche ist ausführlich beschriftet und man findet sich gut zurecht. Die Lage in Brooklyn auf der 4. Strasse ist perfekt!!! Ganz toll war, dass Laurie für uns ohne Gebühr die Termine gewechselt hat weil uns Opodo mit englischsprachigem Mitarbeiter falsche Termine gebucht hat. Bucht nie bei englischsprachigem Opodo Mitarbeiter - das ist anderes Land und anderes Unternehmen und ihr habt keine Chance etwas zu reklamieren. Laurie hat uns da gerettet und die Termine angepasst. Das war total nett! Ich würde jederzeit wieder zu Laurie!"

Laurie's home is authentic Brooklyn, close to subways, awesome food, Prospect Park, friendly Brookklynites, all that is good about NYC! Yet - the neighborhood is quiet and mellow.    Laurie is welcoming, informative and very accomodating.  The delicious espresso, bagels and cream cheese in the morning -- just the icing on the cake!  Please note, as Laurie states in her post, the bedrooms are on the 3rd floor, so be prepared for the climb up the classic staircase.  It's a great way to assuage guilt after all the rich food you are going to enjoy!"

Close to the subway for easy access to the city, and there are lots of restaurants, shops and cafes in the neighborhood, if you don't want to travel far. The house is lovely.

Silvia was very helpful and able to recommend great places to eat and visit.  The location is great as it is in a fun neighborhood and an easy ride to the city.  
11708,15838,1/11/09,44214,Michael,Silvia was a great host.  She provides a map of the Bushwick area and is very knowledgeable concerning the neighborhood.  She's always around in case of emergencies but leaves you alone to do your thing.  Would rent again.
11708,17375,15/11/09,48713,Jo And Dave,"We had a great time in New York.  Thanks for putting us up Sylvia!  The apartment is cute, and as advertised and access to the L and JMZ was very convenient.  Sylvia provided us a great map of local things to do--we only wish we had more time to enjoy everything.  Tea each night, a little light reading from ""Broken Land"" and the comfortable accommodations were the perfect respite after long days of sightseeing. We'd stay there again!"
11708,18338,26/11/09,48303,Ingrid,"We stayed six nights and I would not choose it again. The apartment really is in the basement, it is pretty dark, you never know what the weather is like until you leave the house, the concrete floors make the apartment uncomfortable (bring slippers), there is no closet to hang-up your clothes and I found the place smaller than it appears on the pictures. We did not enjoy staying there. Silvia is very nice and helpful."
11708,20876,20/12/09,26187,Christine,The accommodation was exactly as described. Really conveniently located to several different subways line stations which makes getting around really easy. Bushwick is a really interesting and safe place that Sylvia is lucky enough to call home and that my partner and I were lucky to call home for just over 2 weeks. There were hangers for coats etc and a large chest of drawers for other clothes. The place was really well heated. Sylvia & Ty were extremely helpful and gave us an insight into the local happenings. We would definitely stay here again.

The space is small but cozy, and the neighborhood is colorful and convenient to other parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan.  Silvia provided us with a map of restaurants, shops and art galleries in the neighborhood, and she even gave us directions over the phone when we got lost trying to find the Brooklyn Flea.  We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay with Silvia again."
11708,72489,1/8/10,6161,Anwar,"We stayed at Silvia's place for a weekend, she was very kind and responsive. The basement is cute and has a character. We didn't spend much time exploring the area, but there are plenty of choices for food and drinks and Silvia has prepared a list of them.

I would definitely consider staying with Silvia again.  Thank you!"

The place is fairly close to Manhattan (15min metro distance) and safer than it looks at the first sight. I have slept like a baby. I would have liked to stay longer. Thanks Silvia!
"
11708,122171,18/10/10,262334,Nicole,I truly ejoyed my stay. Silvia gave me my privacy and the apt was well kept. If I had to come back I would not mind staying there. I recommend her.

11708,143192,22/11/10,290943,Janet,"Cosy, comfortable and convenient. The place is small, but private and quiet (well, very little street noise but bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper because of the pipes). Close to both the L and the M so very easy to get in or out of midtown or downtown Manhattan, or hipster Williamsburg, etc. A very good find, and we're thankful to Silvia for hosting us!"
11708,153364,13/12/10,262952,Paula,"This basement apartment is exactly as it appears in the pictures. The place was clean and private with fully functioning facilities. Silvia was a great host to me and my boyfriend and was available before and during our stay to answer any questions or concerns. She was really helpful getting us acquainted with the area and provided a map of all the nearby restaurants and attractions. I highly recommend this place for a single person or a couple who seeks an affordable, private place in a cool, diverse, Brooklyn neighborhood."
11708,190296,28/2/11,391505,Katie,"Silvia was a gracious host, very easy to work with.  The apartment was clean and private. The hot shower was a blessing after long days of trekking around Manhattan and Brooklyn.  The only problem we had was with the neighborhood.  We heard a terrible street fight late on Saturday night, and we didn't feel very comfortable exploring the area during the day.  Other than that, I would recommend Silvia's place if you are looking to stay around the Brooklyn area.  "
11708,380120,18/7/11,686093,Daniel,Great place in a very convenient location. Would definitely recommend to anyone. Particularly pleasant on really hot days because it stays very cool. Hope to stay again next time I am in Brooklyn.

The only thing is the noise at night, from the street . Lively neighborhood!

The host was very helpful and nice. 
I recommend this apt if you want a cool place to stay in."
11708,562461,24/9/11,913340,Masahiro,"This was our first Airbnb experience for my wife and I.  We enjoyed our four night stay at Silvia's apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn.  Silvia was truly a great host!  She responded very fast on all of our text messages, and she gave us plenty amount of tea and coffee when we asked.  The room was very cute and clean, good size for two people.

Perhaps the only problem we had was the neighborhood. It was a bit sketchy and we didn't feel too comfortable when we got off the subway station.  But we didn't encounter any troubles so I think it's safer than it appears!

Silvia gave us the list of local cafe and restaurants, so I strongly recommend to try one of them if you have some free times.  We tried her favorite Italian pizza place, and they had one of the best pizza we've ever had!!!  Thank you Silvia for hosting us wonderful time!"

Silvia is a really nice host, she prepared the map of the area with things to see and do around which was very helpful. We have visited some of her recommended places and really enjoyed. The flat is cosy and comfortable. I would definitely go back again. "
11708,636529,17/10/11,1128381,Mark,"Two months later and I'm still thinking about what an amazing time we had in Brooklyn.  Silvia’s apartment is located in an upcoming neighbourhood near 2 subway stops which go directly into the city.  Add to this the fact that there is one of the best restaurants in the city nearby (Roberta’s (Website hidden by Airbnb) and you have yourself a winner.  You can’t beat the price and you can’t beat the hospitality.  We drove to NYC from Nova Scotia, and we were worried about street parking while we were there but once we arrived it was no problem finding a spot (right across the street from the apt.) and the neighbourhood was very safe.  Just be aware most spots have a 2 hour window twice a week when you have to move for street parking and you’ll be fine.  I’ve seen other comments about the noise in the neighbourhood but either we were too tired to notice or we’re more tolerant because it was never an issue for us.  If you’re looking to do NYC on a budget, Brooklyn is definitely the way to go. We would definitely stay here again."
11708,699725,7/11/11,898170,Mark,"This is a modest but comfortable basement apartment, slightly cramped  (I'm 6'2"" and hit my head on a duct a few times, but I'm also a little clumsy!) but clean and quiet. Silvia and her family are great hosts and care about their guests. Good about communication and helping with little things as needed. She also took time to point out things in the area and help with directions. A very positive air bnb experience. "
11708,724297,16/11/11,1306388,Karen,Silvia was a very friendly and helpful host. The apartment was nice and clean. I would defiantly recommend Silvia to anyone I know.

She had a very useful and detailed list of things to do and places to go to. We didn't get to meet Sylvia in person but she answered our emails right away with any questions we had. Would gladly recommend her place!"
11708,1220463,3/5/12,254609,Gemma And Mitch,"We had the best time staying at Silvia's place. Bushwick was a great location and we felt very safe walking around, even late at night. Two subway lines are within easy walking distance and we really found it no hassle at all getting to and from Manhattan. 

The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable, we almost slept too well in the dark and quiet basement room, finding ourselves sleeping late most days. We had everything we needed.

Silvia is lovely and left us with a very useful map full of nearby food and shopping destinations as well as local places of interest. It was my birthday while we were staying and I emailed her in advance to ask if she knew of any good vegetarian restaurants for us to visit for my birthday dinner and she came up with some great options for us. She gave us privacy but was also very available and approachable should we need anything. 

I'll definitely stay again when I eventually make it back and would recommend Silvia's place to anyone.



Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!"

11708,1643696,6/7/12,2632860,Andy C,"The basement apartment was pretty much as expected. Was clean and everything was as described. Good bed and my wife and I slept well. Better than most motel beds. Some noise from upstairs but not bad. A little warm when we returned in the evenings but cooled off with the fan on. (we stayed gone most of the day) It was in the 90's some days so with no air conditioner it was surprisingly cool. Very nice couple and we enjoyed our visit to Ty's shop down the street. The neighborhood is in transition but was interesting to visit. Very multicultural. Would consider staying again.

11708,2231326,8/9/12,312295,Michelle,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Silvia's home last week.  The location was just perfect!  Commuting to Williamsburg and Manhattan (our favorite places to be) was very easy.  The train stations are located near by.  For the most part the apartment was clean, bedding, bathroom and mini kitchenette were user friendly.  A couple of issues, I felt that the photos were misleading with regard to the overall cleanliness....the floor wasn't  the cleanest, we had to wear slippers because our feet would get black.  Then in order to get to the basement apartment you had to go through the garage (which I didn't mind too much) however, it was very crowded with miscellaneous items so you had to be careful coming and going.  I felt the need to purchase my own Lysol and Febreeze to keep some spots clean.  

Otherwise if you are looking for a close location to zip back and forth....this place works well for that purpose.  I met Silvia at the end of the trip, she arranged for her friend to meet us which was just fine:)"
11708,2371901,22/9/12,1605969,Eri,"She let us stay 10 days before arrival. She is very flexible. 

I asked her how to get her apartment. But she didn't reply my e-mail so my friend and I lost our way. I had to use my international phone call four times to get her place. It cost $30. It rained terribly that day and I had a big suit case. I didn't feel her consideration.
The room was good and the bathroom was clean. There is not a carpet in the room though.
Somebody was using a washing machine at 6 a.m in the basement. That made me sleep badly.
There isn't a key for the room. It means the room is not completely private. Everyone in the apartment can come into the room.
You can find better one.

11708,2515754,5/10/12,2551832,Dirk,"A nice little basement apartment in Bushwick, a perfect base for a few days in the city. Because it's in the basement it doesn't get much light, but if you're in NY you'll be out all day doing things anyway. Silvia and Ty were super nice, helping me out when I messed up my booking and letting me store my luggage in their garage. 5 stars!"
11708,2658468,19/10/12,3631295,Lydia,"Clean simple place to stay.  A little bit further out than I had anticipated from the city, but not at all far from the subway station.  Took at least 1 hr to get into the city and longer to get back later at night because that train wasn't running straight through
The host was nice and helpful, with plenty of information about the area.

11708,2720894,26/10/12,226187,Cecilia & Greg,"Silvia is a kind and easy going host - she was contactable and available throughout our stay, but she gave us our privacy and we rarely saw her.

The apartment was nice - small but clean and had everything we needed.  There was a hairdryer which was useful! Silvia also has a folder which has information on the area and a map with good local bars/restaurants for people who may not know the area. There are lots of great cafes etc close by, and the food almost everywhere is excellent!
The only downside to the apt is its entrance through the garage, but you do get used to it.

If there are people staying in her other apartment above it may be noisy! We had people staying above us near the end of our stay, and I don't think they realised the noise they made really travelled. This wasn't a huge problem for us, but for those who need peace and quiet 24/7 it may not be ideal.

The apt is close to 2 L train stops as well as the M train, and it was very easy to get about.  Some blocks around the Bushwick area felt a little unsafe at night when we walked through them, but we had no trouble at all.

11708,2825050,7/11/12,1353102,George,"Silvia is a wonderful host.  We stayed with her during super-storm Sandy, which was pretty intense.  Silvia was very accommodating and easy to communicate with.  The basement is cozy and user-friendly. Silvia's husband and two kids are really wonderful as well.  Her husband's elegant sculptures are positioned thoughtfully through the space, combining disparate found materials with recycled consumer products.  We highly recommend this apartment."
11708,2875834,13/11/12,3694751,Joe,"I had a great time staying in Sylvia's apartment. It was very convenient getting around Brooklyn with the L and M trains a short walk away. There are some great food options nearby, had a great meal at Roberta's pizza as well as a local taco restaurant. As I was attending conference in Brooklyn, this was a great place to relax after a long day of work. The apartment was generally quiet, but there was a bit of noise from the apartment upstairs which didn't bother me all that much. If I attend the conference next year I will definitely be checking to see if Sylvia's place is available."
11708,3051585,9/12/12,4095180,Hanna,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 7 nights to visit NYC on vacation. We definitely enjoyed staying at Silvia's basement apartment in Brooklyn and would do it again! It was a good deal and Silvia was very nice and accommodating. Using the subway, it took us about 50 minutes to get to Times Square, 35 minutes to get to the financial district, 1 hour 40 minutes to get to LaGuardia airport (if you take a taxi, it costs about $34). The subway station is a few blocks from the apartment, about a 10 min walk. The neighborhood seems a bit sketchy and unsafe at first, but after staying there a while (often coming back late), I've found it to be pretty safe and every night, a police car would drive around. The place is exactly as you see in pictures, water was always hot, and the heater was effective, WiFi was fast, but the only thing that was a bit of a surprise to me was that the bedroom is the only room that you can lock off as your own. The bathroom and kitchen sink area are technically left open, as you don't get a key for these places, but I assume no one is really supposed to come down while we are staying there. Also, you can definitely hear the people upstairs walking and the pipes make some noise, but it didn't bother us too much as neither of us are light sleepers and we were always dead tired when we came back from the city. All in all, had a great experience and strongly recommend staying at Silvia's, especially if you want to save money on hotels!"
11708,3482352,5/2/13,4529780,Adam,"We stayed in Silvia's apartment for 6 days. Great base to see New York from. Very nice apartment, convenient, cozy and friendly hosts. "
11708,3575346,18/2/13,4952188,Paul,"Checked in on Thursday, and Silvia stayed out of our hair the whole time we were there (excellent).  The apartment is not luxurious but it's nice enough, because we weren't in NYC to sit around all day. There was some noise that woke us up in the very early morning, but other than that our stay was very enjoyable."
11708,3671490,2/3/13,3736134,Andrew,cozy space that served as a great little base for my brief time in NYC 
11708,3837755,19/3/13,5049351,Ruth,"Silvia was accommodating and the unit was clean and convenient. We stayed for a looong time - 11 nights! The private entrance is accessed first into the foyer then through the garage, then down the stairs past the washer and we had no problems with coming in late nights. Partway through our stay some other people came to staying in the other unit she has upstairs and you could definitely hear them but nothing too bad. Shower is small, but again, everything was clean and functional (hot water, wifi, heater, etc.). Great to have the mini-fridge and there was also a toaster oven, electric kettle, coffee maker, etc. and we were able to do a quick load of laundry partway through the stay which was nice (I never heard anyone else doing laundry, but the machine is loud). There is a lock on the bedroom door but not to the main kitchen/bathroom area, though, again, we never saw anyone in the garage or laundry area and I don't expect anyone came into our area. Bed was fairly comfy - firm - and there are now nightstands on both sides of the bed. Lots of great stuff in the area and Silvia provides a binder and map of her favorite bars, restaurants and cultural activities in the area. Several different subway stations within easy walking distance. Would definitely stay again - if you're looking to stay in Brooklyn this is a great, affordable and convenient option."
11708,4000171,2/4/13,4961180,Hannah,"All in all a very good experience staying at Silvia's. Silvia and her husband were really friendly and helpful. They live in a nice area away from the touristy city center, close to restaurants and bars. Their  recommendations really helped us to explore the area. Everything worked fine as to communication, check-in etc. There was always someone around if we wanted to ask something, but they never disturbed us. As to the room, it was everything we expected, as shown in the pictures. I would recommend staying here!"
11708,4127189,12/4/13,1644068,Cutler,"Silvia and Ty are very friendly, and their cute little basement apartment was a wonderful oasis at the end of long days (and nights) of exploring. We really loved the neighborhood, an excellent mix of fancy and funky, and the tips provided by the hosts really helped to make sense of them all. There is so much good food around that the efficiency-style kitchen was perfect--who cooks when they're visiting NYC anyway? Clean, comfortable, and private. We were there for a week and only saw others in the building one time. A perfect haven. We'll definitely be looking at their place next time we head to Brooklyn!"
11708,4771937,25/5/13,5811024,Achim,"Just what we expected!
Nice little appartment in the basement, private bathroom and kitchenette. Bed was comfy.
Silvia stayed pretty much out of our hair, but was available for questions. We were able to use the washing machine and dryer. Three subway stations in walking distance and a lot of shops and restaurants in the area.
All in all enjoyable stay!"
11708,4858152,29/5/13,4660142,Iris,We are a young couple and we stayed in late May for three days. A great little apartment in the heart of Bushwick. Easy to get around and the host was fantastic! Check out Roberta's- a great little pizza place in the neighbourhood. 
11708,5315640,24/6/13,2733793,Jeremy,"Had a great stay in Bushwick! 

Silvia and her husband were very accommodating. I was on my own, but the apartment is the perfect size for two people. The bedroom was a very comfortable size and the bathroom was spotless.

It was a bit further out than I thought from Manhattan, but I spent a lot of time in Brooklyn on this trip so it was very convenient. 

Thanks again Silvia!"
11708,5389353,27/6/13,2051545,Lots,Clean and cozy! Silvia is a great host; she is available for questions and guidance while respecting your privacy. The apartment has the necessities for a pleasant stay in Brooklyn. It's in a good location with lots to do. 
11708,5616415,8/7/13,6656112,Ida,"Me and my friend stayed at Silvia's place for a week. We were out most of the day and there was no problem getting in late. The area is really nice. Silvia gave us a map marked with interesting things to do and see as well as places to go eat. We found some great cafes!
The metro is close and the lovely Williamsburg is only a few stops away.
"
11708,5938978,23/7/13,5832725,Violet,"Our stay in Silvia's basement was great. The bed was comfy and everything was very clean. Communication was easy and fast. We loved the area as it felt safe, was well connected to public transport and there was loads going on. Also, the hair dryer for guests was a nice touch as my English one didn't work in the US!"
11708,6459013,13/8/13,6200547,Janelle,"We really enjoyed our stay in Silvia's apartment. It was clean and relatively quiet and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay - bathroom, aircon, small fridge and coffee maker, small toaster oven.

 It's a short walk to the subway L and M lines, we always felt safe walking around the neighbourhood, we had no trouble at all. Silvia provides a map for her guests with local eateries and galleries etc that she recommends and we were never disappointed with her choices! Bushwick looks like there isn't much going on, but you just need to know where to look! 

Silvia was really prompt and helpful in her emails. She was out of town with her family when we visited and she arranged for a friend to let us in and show us around and everything went smoothly. 

Regretfully in our hurry to get to the airport for an international flight, my husband and I forgot to return the apartment keys! This never happens to us! We felt dreadful about it :(

Thanks for the great stay! Next time we visit we'd love to stay again. "
11708,6890178,29/8/13,6304987,Gerrit,"Well I guess this is very New York: Really small apartment and a relatively high price - seen in realtion of course. Pretty loud since there are people living directly over the bedroom, the street and the washing mashine/dryer right there, where the stairs go down - yes, it's in the cellar. No fair-trade tee or coffee as told in the announcement and the kitchen does not need to be mentioned.

Everything else worked out well, got the key and a little map with tips what to do was really nice. Unfortunately did not get the chance to meet Silvia, but I guess she is a nice person."
11708,7272183,14/9/13,6212696,Diego,The place was very well located and very clean. Perfect for a couple looking to spend a week in NYC.   Silvia and her husband were very kind and helpful towards everything. Next time I visit NYC I would have no doubts on contacting them again.  I recommend it 100%.
11708,8276506,23/10/13,8341768,Marie,"The apartment was nice, comfortable and clean, just a short walk from the L train subway station. Silvia was helpful, easy to communicate and always responded quickly. Overall we had a very pleasant stay. Thank you again, Silvia!"
11708,8427067,30/10/13,8368464,John,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay at Silvia's place. It is located just minutes from the Jefferson Street station on the ""L""line. It was perfect for all our needs.They have a great WiFi connection and the shower water pressure was strong and hot. You must go to Roberta's for the gourmet pizza, which is to die for. It's very popular, so expect a long wait. We went on a Sunday for brunch with no wait. New coffee houses and old bakery's are within a few minutes walk. Enjoy Bushwick!!!!"
11708,8780950,18/11/13,8527366,Pasquale,"Appartamento come da foto, piccolo e poco (Website hidden by Airbnb) sacrificio per una piccola vacanza si può anche fare...poco pulito però, abbiamo fatto noi le pulizie e siamo rimasti delusi dall'apparente entrata per raggiungere il basement, passare per un garage fatto deposito non è  il massimo per gli amanti della pulizia. Tutto questo non è menzionato nelle specifiche.
Il bagno è nuovo e discreto rispetto al resto dell'abitazione.
Padroni di casa disponibili ma un pò rumorosi, casa ben posizionata per raggiungere la metro. "
11708,9119989,8/12/13,10286773,Kalyx,"I had a wonderful stay at Silvia's! She was incredibly accommodating and also provided an awesome guide (and map) to the area.

11708,15713196,14/7/14,5935976,Aj,"Close and convenient to pretty much anywhere we needed to go. 15 minutes to Manhattan, 5-10 minutes to Brooklyn. It was perfect for us and close proximity to family.  Did not spend much time at the actual room, but was comfortable and appropriate. Hosts were great and provided all necessary information. Allowed us to check in early and were super accommodating. "
11708,16121492,22/7/14,17269352,Matt,"Silvia and Ty's garden apartment unit was the perfect quiet respite for a busy week in New York. It is a short stroll to several subway stops and bus routes that got us around. The space was very private with our own keys, stocked with amenities in the bathroom, coffee and kitchenware, and a concierge folder for restaurant and other neighborhood recommendations for the Bushwick area that proved very helpful. Hangers, umbrellas, and lots of thoughtful small details that made us feel provided for and.

Original artwork and custom metal fixtures by the artists who own the place made the unit very welcoming and unique. My partner and I spent several happy days there and would gladly recommend it to others."
11708,16440915,27/7/14,313311,Rj,Very nice stay at Silvia and Ty's place. It was private and I really liked the neighborhood.

11708,17012961,5/8/14,18612301,Joan,"Silvia and her family were very welcoming.  We felt very safe, and slept great ! The basement was clean, the shower hot, the kitchen area stocked with basics. 
We did not hear any noise above us, so it was a quiet retreat at the end of the days roaming around the city.  Bushwick also is a very cool neighborhood,  and  easy to walk around, and get to subway. 
I was prepared for the going thru the garage because of other reviews....but it's not  for anyone elderly.  Furnishings are modest, concrete floor, simple bedding. I would return to this spot again. "

11708,17763675,17/8/14,10175050,Finn,Silvia had a notebook full of neighborhood suggestions and info to browse through when we arrived. The apartment was clean and looked just how we imagined it. It really felt like our own little apartment for a week. Our hosts were very accommodating and friendly.
11708,19265907,9/9/14,17349919,Bryan,"My wife and I stayed for a week while we toured the city.  We had complete privacy in the nice and cool basement space.  The neighborhood offers a good variety of places restaurants and cafes to choose from.  The L train is not too far of a walk, so access to Manhattan is not too difficult.  Silvia's place also had wifi and a great shower.  The only thing I wish we had were a couple more pillows, other than that our stay at Silvia's was very nice."
11708,19437804,12/9/14,20862113,Victoria,"Silvia and Ty were very accommodating and hospitable. The apartment was pretty easy to find and close to several trains, including the L, which we took frequently. The list of suggestions our hosts had was great and really appreciated. The apartment was perfect for what we needed-- a cozy, safe place to crash after a busy day of exploring. I hope to stay again in the future!"
11708,19606473,15/9/14,259452,Lee,"Silvia was great at keeping in touch and made it easy for our late evening check in.

- needs a bit refurbishment
- messy garage, but that's art ;-)

Silvia was a great host, very responsive and even provided us with a binder full of information about the area, and the location was perfect- quiet but very close to trains and everything to do in Bushwick/Brooklyn. We would love to stay at the Tripoli house again the next time we visit the city!"

11708,24808329,3/1/15,2595745,Trammi,"I personally met with the owner, she was very sweet and  warm. I felt really comfortable staying in her own. Everything was accurate in the description. It is a basement apartment, so there are ""basement"" sounds. But other than that, it was a great place to stay in Brooklyn. "
11708,25202466,9/1/15,775523,Nancy-Diane,"Silvia made it easy for us to check into the apartment. This apartment was just two blocks from our daughters and it was quite a comfortable walk, as comfortable as can be in 10 degrees in January winter"

11708,39176563,21/7/15,2040194,Mary,"It was easy to communicate with the hosts to arrange my check-in time.  The description of the apartment is accurate.  It is very basic, but comfortable.  The lighting was good, the bed was comfortable, there was plenty of hot water and towels, and the wifi worked well.  Kitchenette is very basic, not set up for serious cooking, but it was nice to have a fridge.  The weather was quite hot during my stay, but the fan in the bedroom cooled things off at night so that I had no trouble sleeping.  It was also very quiet."
11708,42205698,11/8/15,17268584,Zoe,"The apartment was clean and the host was kind and attentive. The only downside was that the bed was a bit hard and the room a bit hot. The price was worth it, though!"
11708,46923290,14/9/15,13645937,Heather,"Silvia was great, and allowed me to check in early because my flight arrived at 6:00 AM.  The place is exactly how described.  Nice, clean, new bathroom, small kitchenette, just enough for a weekend trip.  The bedding and towels were clean.  There were hangers and a place to hang  clothes.  
The apartment is small, and can only accommodate two people.  It is in the basement, and was a bit warm in mid-September, but there is a good fan that kept us cool at night.  Great location, quiet neighborhood, only a few blocks from the Central subway station.   Lots of places to eat, and unwind. There a good grocery store very close by.   There is a bus stop just outside the house.  Silvia also has a very extensive map of the neighborhood, with restaurants, bars and coffee shops, and other points of interest identified.  Nice place, close to my son's apartment, and made our trip less complicated.   "

11708,48715099,28/9/15,11841497,Amanda,Modest living. Great for backpackers/travelers.
11708,50043982,8/10/15,44864836,Cadienne,This was a great place in a great location. Nice and secluded so you have your own space and they let us drop off our suitcases early so we could do some sightseeing.
11708,50748715,14/10/15,39412022,Mark,A really nice area and a perfect space to rest up between busy New York trips. Really great for young couples or travellers wanting to experience Brooklyn rather than the more touristy Manhatten. Really recommended
11708,51124867,18/10/15,40583515,Jacques & Sophie,"Silvia est accueillante , l'appartement est très sympat dans un quartier agréable."
11708,51580591,21/10/15,1735183,Raele,"Incredible value! We've never stayed in Bushwick before, usually preferring Brooklyn Heights. That area has become too pricey, so we took a chance on Bushwick, hearing it's become fun and eclectic and safer. It was all of that, plus friendly and felt safe.

Absolutely enjoyable area, more than enough coffee shops and restaurants to walk to, and we also walked a lot to nearby Williamsburg, with even more opportunities for great dining. 

Silvia and her family were wonderful; we enjoyed meeting her smart and charming daughter and her interesting artist husband, who maintains an art studio next-door that you can visit.

This basement apartment is reached through a narrow passageway in a full storage garage, which might be off-putting at first, but don't be fooled: you come down the stairs and into a clean, spacious and minimal apartment.  It is basic, but has everything you need. Extra toiletries, toaster oven, coffee maker, extra comforter, etc. 
There's a groovy custom-made bench and iron table to sit at for a quick snack or some sightseeing planning.

Silvia provides a three-ring binder with neighborhood menus and house rules. Try El Kucho, just on the next block, *great* Mexican & nice owners. At this time, they have not yet received their liquor license, but about five doors down on the same spot is a great wine store.  
Archie's, a nearby bar and pizza spot is a great alternative to the 1-2 hour wait at famous Roberta's pizza.

One or two reviewers here have said that it was warm down there in the summer. The weather was cool during our visit, so we weren't too warm. The temperature was really perfect. There are two small windows in case you feel claustrophobic, but we never did. She has decorated it in a way that feels airy. At any rate, we were out of our room early and back late, enjoying Brooklyn!

The bed and pillows are quite firm, but we slept well. You are in a basement; expect upstairs noise. I am a very light sleeper, so I always bring earplugs; noise wasn't a problem.

I don't see how anyone could get a better value in Brooklyn, so close to Brooklyn Heights. I doubt we will ever stay anywhere else again. I see myself coming back here year after year!
"
11708,51705665,24/10/15,4990555,Lydia,"Perfect inexpensive place to sleep and keep your things while spending time in Brooklyn/New York City. The apartment is in the basement of a house, but has all the basics - real bed, bathroom, mini-fridge. Youll be spending all your time exploring the city anyway, so this little spot is the best deal if you just want a private space to lay your head at the end of the day. The neighborhood is great as well - it's a 10 minute walk to the nearest L stop, and close to lots of great Bushwick restaurants and bars as well. "
11708,52225807,27/10/15,42942315,Chanel,Host was communinative and helpful to our arrival. Directions were provided from port authority.

11708,53664235,10/11/15,3753077,Marcella,Silvia's home was just what I needed. The apartment was right near the gallery I was presenting at. Which was also very convenient. Excellent communication from the get go. Thank you. 
11708,56671664,16/12/15,22317967,Caetano,"The place was easy to find at a 15-minute walk from Jefferson St metro. We were stuck in traffic on the way to NYC, but  texted the hosts on our way and had no problem arriving later than we had told them originally.

As listed, the place is a basement, but it is not an entirely separate apartment, with the entrance being through a garage used as storage space and quite crowded.
Also, being in the basement there is no central heating, but a small space heater. Furthermore, being next to the furnaces and pipes there is quite a bit of noise during the night, and steps from the kids in the morning.

The mini-kitchen is less than what would be expected from an ""entire apartment""; to be fair it is as listed, but it is not possible to cook or even heat a frozen pizza, since there is no stove or oven, so it's not possible to have more than a simple breakfast."
11708,63039731,19/2/16,40646059,Tianna,"Silvia was very accommodating especially with the checking in/out process. This little apartment is perfect if you want somewhere to stay at night while you spend your days out & about in the city. It's in the heart of Bushwick where you are not too far from the rest of Brooklyn, and not too far away from Manhattan, either. It had the essentials, including heat and a fan. The bathroom is cute, as well. This space is perfect for two people. Keep in mind, you're in a basement, so you hear everything going on above you, but that comes with any basement apartment. It was a lovely stay & I will definitely keep Silvia & her husband's space in mind if I ever find myself in the Brooklyn area. "
11708,68341075,4/4/16,42958178,Nick,"Very good, quiet place to stay. Had all needed amenities (no microwave though) and some great restaurants nearby. Pretty close to the subway too, ~20-30 minutes to downtown Manhattan. Sylvia was very welcoming and accommodating. Would definitely stay there again."
11708,74573795,15/5/16,19019975,Giorgia,"Silvia and her partner Ty were really nice, reactive and available. The accomodation corresponds to the description, it's pretty minimalist and is located in the basement and accessible via a pretty packed garage and laundry room. It has a separate bedroom, a private bathroom and a small kitchenette with mini fridge and coffee maker (keep in mind that there is no stove for cooking so you can't cook dinner or even have dinner in the basement - no windows and no proper table to enjoy a meal). The bedroom is just under their apartment so you hear the lovely kids jumping around in the morning :) The area is nice, very fancy restaurants and bars, I would recomment 983 Café, Forest Park, Sea Wolf, Momo Sushi Shack, Roberta's etc. Silvia and Ty will give you a very useful recap of the bars/cafes/restaurants nearby the basement, vith (Hidden by Airbnb) maps so you can see where they are located. Very very useful thank you! You are near the L line (Jefferson Street) and the M line (Central Av) so you have several options to reach Manhattant. Amazing street art in the area, great vibes in the Latin American barber shops where they dance while working, groceries stores available, definitely a good area. Enjoy!!!! "
11708,75170495,19/5/16,56203752,Tommaso,"Non abbiamo conosciuto Silvia ma siamo stati accolti e sempre in contatto con Tyrome, persona accogliente gentile e disponibile.
Appartamentino nel seminterrato della casa ci si accede passando attraverso un garage abbastanza disordinato, ma passato quello la casa si presenta pulita, ordinata, piccola ma accogliente arredata con numerose opere d'arte costruite con materiali di riciclo e metalli dallo stesso Tyrome che è un artista.
Nota positiva la vicinanza alla Metro.
Unica nota negativa i vicini piuttosto rumorosi..
Il quartiere non ha l aspetto dei migliori  quartieri di Brooklyn ma tutto sommato è tranquillo, tappezzato di locali e negozietti vari."
11708,78617068,7/6/16,64372019,Evelyn,Ty was there to welcome us when we arrived.  The place was exactly as he described. There are local stations to take the train.  
11708,79674212,13/6/16,31831059,Kevin,Tyrone's place was the perfect location and just what we needed. 
11708,80342526,17/6/16,701371,Giulia,"We had a great time at Tu's studio. The studio was clean, confortable and exactly as shown in the photos. Ty was very kind and welcoming. Location is perfect if you wish to see the NYC and have fun in Brooklyn, Williamsburg and Bushwick. Totally recommend! Thanks again for everything! "
11708,81364184,22/6/16,60102494,Tammy,Thank you for a good experience. We were so close to our daughter and the subway. We would definitely stay here again. 
11708,86132622,15/7/16,71760499,Juho,"Our stay at Tyrome's was great! As anyone who's been to NYC might know, despite being awesome, the city can also be chaotic and tiresome at times, and Tyrome's basement was a perfect peaceful and private place to rest after a long day. Bushwick is a nice and interesting neighborhood with lots of places to go and see in itself, and Tyrome had a lot of great recommendations on nearby cafes, restaurants etc. We didn't actually see Tyrome much during our stay but he was always available and nice if we had any questions or problems."
11708,87080258,18/7/16,7506552,Andrew,"We had an amazing time in Tyrome's place. We didn't have much direct contact with Tyrome, but when we did, he was super friendly and helpful. The apartment itself is fairly basic, but I think this is reflected in the price. There is so much to do in Bushwick (amazing restaurants, bars and events) that we just used the place for sleeping. Would definitely recommend!!"
11708,88368106,24/7/16,9704407,Guillem,"Tyrome was very welcoming and we had overall a nice stay.
The accomodation matches the pictures and it is located in the basement and accessible via a pretty packed garage and laundry room. It's a quiet place to stay and close to the J and M subway line to go to Manhattan (about 20 min)."
11708,90628973,1/8/16,75042054,Roberto,"Todo es igual que en las fotos, el espacio era justo lo que necesitabamos para nuestra estadia. Tyrome y Silvia son simpaticos, se preocuparon de estar para recibirnos, y se aseguraron que todo estuviera a nuestra conveniencia. Incluso, ellos hicieron un librito que compila los mejores lugares para ir a comer o tomar algo por el barrio, eso junto con el mapa de las ubicaciones. El barrio es muy buena onda, con mucho arte y varios bares. Es seguro como para salir o llegar a cualquier hora."
11708,91243938,4/8/16,70241928,Dan,Place was great and as described. Tyrome was a nice guy. Thanks!
11708,95980502,21/8/16,41849243,Simeon,"Ty was a really approachable friendly host, this is definitely a rough and ready listing but has all the basics you need. "
11708,98612287,31/8/16,81214140,Julie,just correct :)
11708,100076468,7/9/16,28795904,Valerie,"The apartment was in a fantastic location, close to 3 subway lines. It was (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with Ty was quick and he let us store our bags in his garage for a couple hours after we checked out. The apartment itself was pretty basic. No soap to wash dishes that we could find. No microwave. It was pretty warm when we were there too, we didn't realize until the last night that there is a fan in the bedroom, stored behind a dresser. "
11708,101840604,15/9/16,81122791,Lucile,The place is as described. Located 7-10 minutes by foot from the subway (M and L)

11708,110963140,29/10/16,8123095,Pamela,"Nice place, cozy and private. 8 min walk from metro station. We only saw Tyrome the first day, he is very nice and helpful."
11708,114438827,18/11/16,4589506,Tess,"Tyrome was an excellent host - letting us drop off our bags at the apartment before the check-in time so that we could wander off, and letting us leave them again at the end, as our flight didn't leave until the evening. He was great with communication as well.

The apartment is in a great location - about a 15 min walk to the nearest subway, which takes you through Brooklyn to Manhattan. It was a brilliant base for exploring the city. The neighbourhood itself is also great - lots of independent bars, cafes and quirky shops, as well as some superb restaurants.

The apartment itself is as it looks in the photos - pretty shabby chic. You have the basement floor to yourself (but share the main entrance door with the rest of the house) which includes the bedroom, a small bathroom and a little kitchenette with a sink, kettle and fridge. But why would you need more than that when there are so many world-class restaurants and take-outs in the city?

All in all, Tyrome's was great value - a perfect place to crash after days of exploring NYC. I would recommend staying here!"
11708,120314094,9/12/16,28854603,Mirian,"Todo estaba tal y como se describe en el anuncio. Buena comunicación de transporte. Tyrome nos dejo una carpeta con bastante información de la zona, la cual nos sirvió de bastante ayuda."
11708,122143301,21/12/16,6462164,Maria,"Tyrome is one of the best hosts I've ever had on AirBnB...he not only let us check-in early on the day we arrived, he was also very understanding when our trip ended with an unfortunate illness and he was more than understanding to allow me to stay in the room the few extra hours that made all the difference in helping me rest and catch my trans-atlantic flight. Tyrome thank you so much, you are very kind and generous, and my partner and I really enjoyed our stay in your cosy and unique little flat, a perfect getaway to Brooklyn and Manhattan and a quiet and warm place to come back to after a day and night exploring the city! The list of local bars and restaurants was also great for exploring all the great places around Bushwick."
11708,123734929,30/12/16,33222125,Jymirah,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a.few days since we wanted to explore NYC. The apartment is a basement apartment in their home, and aa such, it did get a little noisy above our heads sometimes. 

The good: Great location. There's a bus that comes right in front of house and it's a 10 minute walk to train station. Also, when you get into the apartment, host has a book which gives you suggestions of food toneat in the area. Very helpful. They also have a whole setup of toiletries, irons, hair dryera, toaster oven, etc. For you to use! There's  also a heater which was great because it was very cold.

The not so great: the walls could use cleaning. I only looked at them once and didn't  want to again. Also, the blankets provided have some spots on them so that freaked me out. Finally, when he says small, it's  verrrry small and people over 6'0 might be uncomfortable in the space. 

Overall, a pretty good experience. "
11708,126640780,13/1/17,109397817,Jason,A nice cozy kitchenette in a historic area in BK. I was welcomed by Tyrome and his 2 children at the door. That was the only time we crossed paths during my stay. It is a basement apartment so you will hear the typical noises such as pipes and boiler but nothing loud and crazy. I will be booking again in the future.
11708,127711876,20/1/17,109397817,Jason,Another great stay. Wouldn't choose another host.
11708,128790854,27/1/17,65607336,Jay,"The pics do more justice to the place when your actually there. The issue for us was that it was listed and confirmed in messages that the place is 'private', however when my partner was alone in the basement, someone was at the top of the stairs doing the laundry, meaning they could easily come downstairs where there is no lock. We decided to check out early and although I paid for the extra 2 nights, my issue was the lack of courtesy communication from the host. I wrote 2 very honest messages (nice one too) about why we wanted to check out and there was no response and although I didn't expect it, it just felt the host wasn't bothered. Just the lack of courtesy is a result of this review, although I can put up with the fact the place wasn't as described."
11708,130949478,9/2/17,109397817,Jason,Wouldn't stay anywhere else in brooklyn but here. Great host.
11708,131753603,13/2/17,29529099,Isaiah,"Great place to stay for short trips to the city.     So many things I didn't know I'd need were provided, including a list of all the local restaurants/bars and art galleries. He made it really easy for us to settle in. "
11708,132831151,19/2/17,31478394,Marcel,"You get what you pay for. There is noise from the heating and the apartment is in the basement, it is a fact. Tyrome was a very friendly host and we indeed had a good stay."
11708,135166063,3/3/17,14029250,David,Nice short stay! Good area good food good people!
11708,136104934,8/3/17,117533869,Kristen,"Great place! Cute apartment, perfect for place to stay to enjoy Brooklyn and Manhattan. If you are just looking for the basics, a bed and a bathroom, this is it. If we were staying longer and were looking to stay in and cook or anything, this is too small for that. But since we wanted to explore all day, this is all we needed, and the price is right. Tyrome was very kind and had an awesome art gallery that you walk through to get to the apartment. There were two locking doors so we felt safe. The neighborhood is amazing, right next to Alphaville which is a cool bar and venue. The walk to the Jefferson stop is a bit of a hike for those who arent used to walking like a new yorker, but overall it was close enough to everything. I would stay here again for sure!"
11708,138652460,20/3/17,1021757,Fabien,"If you didn't notice it through the pictures, that's a cave! A real cave that you access through a garage. The building pipes make a lot of noise. 
But if you are in town to enjoy what has to offer the big apple, not staying home, it could worth it. Let's say that's one of the less expensive (not cheapest, the place is not that cheap) apartment around. And the apartment looks more as a private bedroom than full apartment. "
11708,145204003,17/4/17,43670075,Pascale,"Everything was great, thank you!"
11708,146644526,23/4/17,49388769,Balsa,"Very unobtrusive host! You pass through storage area to get to apartment, but it's not too bad. Tyrome left tips about neightborhood in his little purple book, and andswered questions quickly! I read some people complaining about 10m walk to train station. This is NYC. Better be ready to do some walking whenever you get out. Otherwise take a taxi or bus right in front of the apartment."
11708,147990265,29/4/17,88977186,Lucas,"The space is large for New York, the hosts are quite private and give you space, which was good.  The linen a pillows were lower end, but everything else was nice and we were happy with our stay."
11708,150804492,9/5/17,56339365,Caroline,"Tyrome has been a nice host and helped us out wherever he could! The appartement was very basic, but functional. Definetly a good choice for a low budget, but maybe not suitable for people who expect a cozy and super comfortable place. We weren't a lot at home anyway, so for us it was perfect! :) thanks to Tyrome again! "
11708,151208396,11/5/17,120911817,Daisy,Great cozy space and Ty was very accommodating. 
11708,153023038,19/5/17,21125569,Sabine,"Perfecte locatie om Brooklyn te verkennen. De wijk Bushwick is fantastisch en zeer zeker de moeite waard om verder te verkennen. Goede uitval locatie om in Manhattan te komen. Goede metro verbinding, alles is op loopafstand.
Het appartement was precies zoals op de foto's. Heel rustig in de avond/nacht, wij hebben nauwelijks wat gehoord. Onze eerste dagen was het koud, dus het kacheltje was erg fijn!
Ty is een goede host en erg duidelijk in zijn communicatie! Leuk om hem nog een paar keer gezien te hebben en ook dan is hij zeer vriendelijk en behulpzaam"
11708,153272800,20/5/17,17612518,Nelson,Gives you the essentials. Owner is very responsive. 
11708,154202176,23/5/17,78172143,Lisa,"Nice place, clean, great area, near subway line!"
11708,160090661,12/6/17,784984,Catherine,"Même si nous avons eu un effet de surprise en pénétrant d'abord dans l'appartement (il faut traverser une pièce débarras avant de descendre à la cave, puis on retrouve l'appartement avec plancher en béton non fini !), nous nous sommes rapidement rendus compte des atouts du lieu : propreté impeccable, fraîcheur même s'il faisait 40C dehors, douche agréable, silence et noirceur pour la nuit...
Nous n'avons pas rencontré notre hôte, mais la communication avec lui fût cordiale, simple et facile.
Je déconseillerais si vous aimez vous attarder longuement chez vous avant de sortir faire des activités, puisque l'endroit est sans charme, mais si comme nous vous préférez aller parcourir brooklyn ou manhattan de votre éveil jusqu'au coucher, cet appartement situé prêt de tout, frais(!), propre et très abordable vous rendra aussi heureuses que nous !"
11708,162791341,22/6/17,13203559,Carly & Corey,"This was a great find in Brooklyn, and we were very happy in the few days we spent there. The neighborhood is great, close to the subway (about a 10m walk). Lots of shops & restaurants nearby. We met up with family during our stay and ended up walking back from the subway at 1 or 2 in the morning a couple times with no problems. It's a big city so you need to pay attention, but overall it's a GREAT neighborhood. We also drove there (on a road trip so couldn't skip having a car) and found street parking our entire stay- which was an awesome bonus.
The area isn't huge but is great for NYC. My husband is pretty tall (over 6') but he just watched his head and was fine. The bathroom is small (but really cute for a small space!) and the shower is great. You are in a basement, and we were there in summer so it was fairly humid inside and out, but the price, location and awesome host outweighed it. We would DEFINITELY stay here again, in a heart beat."
11708,164272292,26/6/17,107803499,Tiffany,Tyrome's place was exactly what we were looking for in Brooklyn. It was a quiet and private studio in the basement of his home. We loved how close it was to so many restaurants and cafes. The studio was clean and had everything we needed to be comfortable. We had an issue with the keys one night and Tyrome was super responsive and made sure we got in okay. I would recommend this place to anyone who is trying to explore Bushwick and get away from the noise of the city. 
11708,166536258,3/7/17,108614246,Ana,"Este espaço é um lugar perfeito para quem busca um local simples e bom para dormir. Não dispõe de grandes luxos. Estranhamos o local de entrada, pois fica atravessando uma garagem bem bagunçada e suja. Em compensação, o quarto é limpo.
O local fica perto de duas paradas de metro que levam à Mannhatan. Não é tão prático que nem ficar na ilha, mas é uma forma excelente de economizar para gastar em outras coisas.
Tyrome como anfitrião foi excelente, prontamente respondendo as mensagens.
Pontos altos: banho excelente, dispõe de máquina de lavar roupas, secador de cabelos e cafeteira."
11708,167422340,6/7/17,21885764,Jeanna,"Ty's place is a basement room as described so expect all that comes with that. Can get a bit noisy from upstairs foot traffic. Didn't bother us much but if you're a light sleeper I can see how that may be an issue. It did have a faint odor but again, it's a basement. The location was great if you're looking to check out the Bushwick/Bed-Stuy area. There's lots to do and see all around Ty's place. L train is about 3 blocks away if you're looking to head to the city. This is gonna be one of those spots where you rest your head at night after a full day of exploring not so much of a place to hang out at. Ty is a super chill guy and made everything easy.  "
11708,171743378,18/7/17,3856381,Aaron,"Great host, great little spot. "
11708,175757802,29/7/17,68650263,Karen,"The apartment is overall decent, but was definitely not what we expected from the impression we got through pictures and description. The apartment had a changing odor from being the laundry room and the basement, meaning that it smelled part time of detergent and part time of moist. Furthermore we didn't have the opportunity to lock the basement door, which we didn't feel good about, due to all of our personal belongings being down there throughout the day. 

But in general a decent apartment, where you get what you pay for. Really nice and friendly host though. Tyrome was very helpful, both in person and through text messages. The neighborhood is something of itself. It's a very cool place to be located, if you want to experience Brooklyn, and everything it has to offer."
11708,177687841,3/8/17,7086121,Ruben,"El apartamento es mucho más bonito en fotos que en la realidad. Accedes por un garaje que está super descolocado. Es un sotano que huele mucho a humedad. No entra casi luz. Las dos únicas ventanas son minúsculas y se oye todo lo de la calle. La cama está humeda. El dueño vive en la casa (en la planta de arriba). Ni se despidió de nosotros. Un poco cutre todo y muy bizarro, eso sí. Muy bien comunicado con el centro con la línea L."
11708,179501448,7/8/17,22625471,Arielle,"Lively neighborhood, great host! Thank you!"
11708,190591354,4/9/17,99016735,Katharina,"Everything was just as we expected it to be. Tyrome is a very nice guy, and an interesting artist. Though the apartment is in the basement, it wasn't very humid, and Tyrome made everything to make it comfy. We had a nice stay in the very artsy and nice community in Brooklyn. The L train is nearby and Tyrome has a lot of suggestions for activities and places to eat/go out close to the apartment on a cute selfmade (Hidden by Airbnb) map he put into the apartment. The apartment is quite quiet, but you can hear the people above you, which didn't bother us, but if you're sensitive it might disturb your sleep. All in all it was very nice, and we would come back everytime."
11708,191731093,8/9/17,7881736,Michelle,"This basement studio/apartment is great for the solo adventure traveler or a young couple who want to be in the heart of Brooklyn. That being said, it is not a place you want to hang out in more than sleeping and using it as a base. The water pressure is great and the extra area between the bedroom and bathroom was helpful for space and food area.  Tyrome was a wonderful accommodating host and I enjoyed talking with him about his art and life in Brooklyn. He also has a cool apartment for rent above the space with mid century furniture if its available it is a great bargain for the space."
11708,192929906,11/9/17,110143341,Clare,"Fantastic communication with the host, however we were a little disappointed with the level of noise, cleanliness & bed linen during our 3 night stay."
11708,193713184,14/9/17,146957330,Blossom,"Tyrome's place is cool. It's a little different and quirky, but has everything you need. It's easily walkable to public transport, take-out and what looked to be pretty good nightlife. If we'd had a longer stay I'm sure we'd have checked it out!"
11708,195749863,20/9/17,122628355,Jp,"Un séjour parfait, l appartement de Tyrome était conforme à l annonce, super bien placé dans un quartier vivant et pittoresque. Metro et commerces à proximité, je recommande vivement cet appartement."
11708,197131977,24/9/17,37044256,Ben,"Overall, Tyrome's apartment is a great place to stay. It's reasonably priced and it's in a cool part of town. Also, catching the L into Manhattan is super easy as there are a few stations that are walking distance from the apartment. Probably not the best place for an extended stay where you plan on cooking meals at home, but it was great for a few nights."
11708,198830182,30/9/17,4033270,Clara,Tres bon rapport qualité prix. Adapté si vous comptez partir tôt et rentrer tard après le dîner. L appartement est très bruyant et très humide. L'emplacement permet d accéder rapidement à Manhattan et de profiter des bars et restaurants de brooklyn.
11708,199970201,3/10/17,144828883,Rebekah,"Very artistic neighborhood, he supplied us with a list of things to do in the area such as dining, entertainment, etc. He was there if we needed him, but out of the way if we didn't. Was very quiet and could hardly hear any traffic from the apartment. I would definitely recommend staying with Tyrome."

11708,210282871,8/11/17,5804904,Virginie,Basement dans un quartier du bushwick en pleine expension. Proche des transports. Apportez juste vos boules Quies ! :)
11708,210640484,10/11/17,27974413,Melissa,"Great stay in the basement apartment. Ty made sure everything was clean and ready to go and stayed in touch with me throughout. Loved the area, ten minute walk to the L train. Wouldn't have stayed anywhere else. Definitely will be back next time I'm in the area."
11708,211667728,13/11/17,45230754,John,"This is a cool, funky artist's place, and it is located in a busy, lively neighborhood in Bushwick, Brooklyn. You may need to be a bit bohemian to enjoy the vibe and the basement room that you access through an art gallery,  but it was perfect for me. Access to Manhattan is easy via the L train, and there is a ton of restaurants and coffee places and shopping in the immediate neighborhood. Ty is friendly and communicates promptly. The WiFi is screaming fast, too... I clocked 40+ mbps. Bathroom is cramped, but there's plenty of hot water in the shower. I would definitely stay here again."
11708,214298636,25/11/17,86527602,Blair,"Overall, for the price and location, this is a great stay if you aren't going to be spending much time in the AirBnb. We spent most of our time exploring the city and the host was very accommodating with check-in times and had the place ready early for me, which was much appreciated!

Pros:
-Great location close to the metro
-Fun art installation upstairs
-Mini fridge
-Fantastic host; quick response time and helpful with check-in/advice
-Fairly quiet neighborhood, which was nice! :)

Cons:
-Shared laundry at top of the steps was very loud when in use
-Loud vent in the room that woke me up a few times
-No extra blankets... thin/old bedding that didn't keep me very warm
-Kind of dingy/cold feel with concrete floors"

11708,249704696,2/4/18,128169816,Alyssa,"This is a great place to stay if you need something small and funcional for a stay in NYC/Brooklyn/Bushwick. I stayed here for ~5 days with my husband and it served to be a perfect temporary home. It has a private entrance, places to hang clothes, hot water, mini fridge, basic kitchen utensils and amenities, and towels. 

Cons: In the winter.. it’s rather cold in there. No heater. The sink in the bathroom is surprisingly small but there is another larger sink in the kitchenette. The place is small (which we liked) but my husband (6’1”)  kept hitting his head on the vents lol but other than that we loved the space. We didn’t spend much time in the space itself though. 

The area is a safe and interesting place to walk around and explore. It’s near a few subway stations, grocery stores, bars, cafes, and a park. We absolutely loved this location and would use this Airbnb again with no hesitation!

~40 min from LaGuardia by taxi and Uber and about 25-30 USD"

In der Nähe gibt es viele Bars, Delis und Restaurants, die zu Fuß zu erreichen sind. Außerdem gibt es zwei alternative Wege, um mit der Subway schnell Manhattan zu erreichen.

Wir sind sehr zufrieden! Thanks Tyrome"

11708,254402233,16/4/18,173654386,Wesley,This spot is perfect in regards to distance from the subway and conveniently next to a park and grocery store. It was perfect for the weekend with my friends in NYC!!!

11708,260650251,4/5/18,20257591,Hubert,"L'emplacement est idéal dans Brooklyn, proche d'endroits animés et de 2 stations de métro.
Par contre il faut bien savoir qu'il s'agit d'un appartement en sous-sol très spartiate. Il n'y a pas à proprement parler de table pour les repas, très peu de luminosité et l'ensemble des équipements sont anciens.
Si vous chercher un peu de confort, je vous le déconseille par contre si vous cherchez un logement entier à faible prix je vous le conseille."
11708,265024733,15/5/18,6373814,Alex,"Tyrome's place is super cute, in a wonderfully vibrant area and very well located in terms of public transit. Couldn't recommend more highly!"
11708,270035102,28/5/18,178494557,Vinod,"I definitely recommend staying at Tyrome’s lovely apartment. Based in Bushwick it really gives you a feel of being a real New Yorker travelling into Manhattan. The apartment was clean, tidy and private as well as having a great artistic vibe. Tyrome was extremely responsive whenever we needed anything and also left a very handy guide to local amenities! Definitely worth a stay!"
11708,275173562,10/6/18,189426557,Isabel,"The location is great, great communication through the subway, very private.
It is what it said it.
 It was a good experience"

11708,281190611,24/6/18,5420789,Alexander,Matches the description. Communication was easy. 10 min walking from a subway. Decent place to stay for a week.
11708,283795743,30/6/18,134523504,Antoine,It was a very nice stay ! 
11708,289109696,11/7/18,5883240,Ellen,Tyrome provides lots of info on the neighborhood in a nice binder. it would be a great place for one or two people looking to explore the awesome neighborhood and the city at large. I didn't spend a ton of time there as it was quite warm inside and did smell a little off but I let Tyrome know and I'm sure they will take care of it as I found him to be a communicative host.
11708,296754248,26/7/18,95873817,Marion,"Nous sommes restés 10 jours. L'appartement est très proche d'une station de métro (7 minutes à pied), ce qui est très pratique quand on passe la journée dehors et que l'on souhaite rentrer rapidement le soir. Le quartier est pittoresque avec des petits commerces à proximité. Il est très pratique pour faire ses petites commissions alimentaires. 
Toutefois, il faut garder à l'esprit que l'appartement est en sous-sol et qu'il dispose d'une luminosité faible. A cela s'ajoute un problème d'humidité qui laisse une odeur persistante lorsqu'on rentre le soir. Le manque d'aération est sans doute un facteur explicatif. Il n'est pas possible de cuisiner : l'appartement dispose seulement d'un frigo et d'un évier. 
Malgré ces derniers éléments nous avons passé un très bon séjour. La communication avec Tyrome a été très facile tout au long du séjour. "
11708,304036867,8/8/18,130393596,Latish,"Great location.  Easy access to downtown.  Also, easy access to ISP airport which I traveled from. Quiet area lots of food places around. I had my littles with me and there was a park literally 1 min away. "
11708,308069591,15/8/18,63591507,Alexandre,"This Airbnb is truly a BASEMENT : there is no light, a bad smell, mold, dust everywhere (we had to crush two spiders) and more importantly there is no aeration, so towels won't dry after the shower and quickly the smell gets worse. Equipments in the kitchen are very limited, dirty, the plates are dusty. There were tasks on our sheets, the pillows smelled badly, no extra-sheets. We stayed for two nights and we were very dissatisfied with our stay, we recommend you to RUN AWAY from this Airbnb for minimum comfort, even though the price seems appealing. On a more positive note, the Airbnb is not far from the subway, you can easily reach Manhattan. "
12048,15524,29/10/09,45969,Kaleel,"I stayed at Ben's place for 3 nights. It was my first time in NYC and Ben kept in touch with me since I booked the place about 2 weeks prior to my arrival. We also spoke on the phone. I already kind of knew Ben before arrival. It was a very secure feeling. He was also helpful when my wireless didn't work. He let me hook on to his broadband. 

Ben's place is very clean and warm. Totally noise free. Double security doors on the ground floor. Commuting also very easy. F train is just 30 yards away from his door. There is grocery shop and McDonald's on the ground floor. I walked to Wall street, South Sea Port, Bodies exhibition, Brooklyn brg and all from him place. No complaint whatsoever. I will stay with him next time. "
12048,16991,11/11/09,49970,Will,"Ben was awesome! Had a great time staying at his place. Very friendly and inviting. Great apartment, great location and super close to subway station, chinatown and Lower East Side. Sorry about the early wake up the first day Ben! Thanks again!"
12048,17415,15/11/09,51686,Guillaume,"I spent a real great time at Ben's apartment. Ben is a real good host. The location is really good, close to the subway and good restaurants and bars. Ben helps you make you feel confortable and fine, it is really helpful when you come for the first time in a place you don't know. I will send my friends there if they ask me where to sleep in NYC!! Trust me this is a real good adress with a real good person. Thanks again Ben, we meet us in Paris next time, take care!"
12048,42164,13/5/10,120714,Mike,Ben is a great host. His pad was perfect for my stay in the city. Strong recommendation from me!
12048,55848,21/6/10,140602,Mario,"I travel to NYC from time to time and my time spent at Ben's place was just right. He was courteous and pleasant and very easy to get along with. If you are looking for a low cost stay in NYC and don't plan on spending a lot of time indoors, this place is for you! "
12048,68406,24/7/10,165904,James,"Ben is a real gentleman and is very accommodating. This was my first time using airbnb and it was a great experience. The apartment itself is very convenient to the F line subway;just a block away. This makes going over to Brooklyn easy (especially DUMBO, one stop away), and the East Village is just two stops uptown. "
12048,73020,2/8/10,55740,Samira,"Ben is definitively a Gentleman. Very nice and helpful. I could even extend my stay at the last minute with no problem.
His place is very clean and sharing the appt with him went smooth. Perfect for short term stay."

I really felt at home at his place.
He told me a lot of things about the neighborhood. Perfect for a short term stay!"
12048,81010,18/8/10,157122,Roie,"Ben is really great, told me about all the cool places to go to in NY, and also the best places to go out at night. Was very patient and kind, though I gave him some troubles. His apartment is really nice, like 10 feet from a subway, and the bed was also very comfy   :-)
Hope to come again."
12048,89587,3/9/10,194582,Joe,Ben is a great host. I stayed at his place while I was looking for an apartment. He made me feel right at home. If your tight on cash this is a fantastic option! 
12048,94473,10/9/10,227235,Joe,"Ben was great. He's really friendly and personable and his daybed is comfortable to sleep on. His place is right by the subway, so it's easy to get to. "
12048,95577,12/9/10,209735,Aaron,"Very nice host, clean quiet apartment.  Literally only steps from the subway and very easy to get to/from JFK as well.  I would definitely stay here again. "
12048,100749,20/9/10,132759,David,"I loved staying with Ben!  We got on famously and I really missed his company after I left.  I stayed on his comfy couch, and although the apartment is small, I never felt uncomfortable.  Ben also kept it nice and cool in the NY heat.  Subway is a stones throw from the front door.  Awesome guy, great pad!  Ben, when you extend and build the Sammy Davis Jr Memorial Wing, I'm coming back to be your permanent room-mate!! Cheers and thanks again.     

 

"
12048,103556,23/9/10,100706,Summer,"Ben was a fantastic host.  I arrived in NYC at an ungodly hour, and Ben was gracious enough to rise early to greet me.  The apartment was in a great location.  Close to the subway, Chinatown and all the fun spots of the Lower East Side.  I plan on staying with Ben again.  "
12048,107342,28/9/10,217258,John,"
 Ben was a brilliant host. His apartment is small; but should be perfect:as a whole for a couple or:as a share for a single.
  His place is on the lower east side. I think this gives the visitor a chance to experience the real Manhattan at a very affordable price. Accomodation in the more 'touristy' areas would not achieve this.
  Ben is completely helpful. I required a further place to stay on my last night-as his place was free for 3 nights only and I was staying in NYC for four nights-and Ben helped me find somewhere.
  Ben is very respectful of his guests. So it is important that anyone staying with him is equally respectful in turn.
 I had a great time in NYC; helped considerably by the use of Ben's safe, secure and well placed apartment.
I would highly recommend both him and his accommdation to thoughful,considerate and appreciative travellers."
12048,109214,1/10/10,206462,Vivien,"I had a great time at Ben's place. He keeps his flat clean and well designed. We had good conversations. I highly recommend it. It's an affordable price and LES is a very nice area. He'll give you advices for places, food, anything."
12048,113643,7/10/10,19592,Nelson,"I am a simple person, not a prince. So my demands are simple.

I stayed on the couch. The couch was fine for me. Ben's place is nicely located for people that want to experience New York living from the common person's point of view. It's in a narrow building conveniently located very close to subway stop East Broadway on the F line. Ben's place is in an Asian and Hispanic area, which was fascinating for me because of the food. I went in early October so it was not hot nor cold. Ben's place is clean by normal international standards. If you're one of those that uses air-purifiers, carries germacide, and also demands service because you're paying, stay at the Ritz-Carlton instead. 

As for Ben, he's a nice easygoing guy. Good roomate. Sleeps late, wakes up early. His presence is only felt when he sits in the armchair to watch some TV and chat a while with his guests. If he wakes up before you do, he knows how to leave quietly without waking you up. He has an interesting cultural background and he's a good conversationalist. I liked the pics he had on the wall (Classic magazine covers). He's also a helpful guy when it comes to travel tips.

In all, Ben is a fine guy as a roommate, and his place will be fine for you if you are an open-minded, simple and easygoing person."
12048,117584,12/10/10,9297,Michael,Ben was a great host and I really liked the convenient location in the Lower East Side. The apartment was small but clean and affordable. Ben was very helpful and informative and accommodating.

Take care Ben!"

12048,135685,8/11/10,241483,Tom,"Ben is a great host - a thoroughly nice guy and very generous and accomodating. His apartment is also really nice, excellent value for money and ideal for the lone traveller. His place is also right next to the Subway so its easy to get around NYC from there too. I would definitely recommend both Ben as a host to anyone looking for a place to stay in New York.

Thanks Ben and hope to see you again next time I'm in NYC,

12048,159684,29/12/10,219537,Slava,"That was my first time I came to US. So, I knew not too much and
really needed some hints on local life. And the help I have got from
Ben was just above any of my expectations. Not only all my questions
were anwsered, he always shared useful information with me and was
interesting how I am doing and was always ready to support if
necessary.

Of course, I tried to bother him as little as possible, as he had his
own things to do. But as a totally new in the city and as far not
perfect in English I know I brought some inconvinience to the great
host - Ben. Sorry!

Also when I could not get some of my stuff in time, he personally
 came to airport to bring it to me before I leave by which just saved
 me. To say I really appreciate this is to say nothing.
First that I will always remember about the NYC is Ben.

Ah, yes, the apartment is very cozy, literally 30 secs to subway
station, very secure and (what appeared to be a big advantage) near
to Chinatown.

Highly recommended."
12048,168009,8/1/11,306894,Emmanuel,"Ben had been a very nice guest. The apartment is very well located and clean.. Perfect ! nothing to add
"
12048,170241,13/1/11,179361,Brandon,Ben replied quickly to my reservation request at short notice and was very responsive to messages. He was also accommodating to my travel plans. This is a great deal and location since it's right above the East Broadway subway station.

12048,230116,18/4/11,383938,Eric,Ben was a great host and this is a good value for NY.  Very close to the F line subway with good connections to anywhere in the city. It's definitely on the small side-- I was worried when I arrived but I got used to it quickly and it wasn't really an issue.
12048,248184,2/5/11,325752,Sarah,"Ben is a teriffic host and a total sweetheart. His place is minutes from the lower east side, financial district and right off the F which will take you all over the place. Ben keeps his place clean, is fun to talk to and hang out with while also letting you do your own thing.  Best value in Manhattan! "
12048,284063,27/5/11,257948,C,"Ben was very friendly and accommodating during my stay. This was my first time visiting New York and he gave me a lot of good tips about navigating through Manhattan. The location of his apartment was conveniently located near public transportation which made it easy for me to get to other neighborhoods. I was recommend his apartment to my friends and would surely stay there again.

Thanks Ben!"
12048,384543,19/7/11,102880,Jim Henry,"Ben was the ultimate host.  His personality works well for this kind of adventure.  Like a concierge, his insights into the city and neighborhood become invaluable suggestions on how to enjoy a brief or longer stay in the city.  I'm a 10 year resident of Manhattan and was looking for a respite on a summer weekend.  And I thought I knew all about the city.  Well, Ben reminded me of just how much there is to learn and about how much fun it is to be in Manhattan!  Thanks Ben!"
12048,922789,15/2/12,398695,Christopher,"I had a great stay at Ben,s place, it was a great location with easy access to everything you would want to see in NYC.

12048,952363,27/2/12,73770,Capt. Apollo,Next to metro and the East River. Easy enough to find and adequate for my i night stay. Ben is a good friend now and hope to see him again.

The apartment is a bit small but Ben was considerate of the space and kept things quiet and relaxed in the mornings and evenings.  I was in NYC for work so I was not in the apartment during the day.  The location was good, especially convenient to the subway, going out in the East Village and the Lower East Side. Great price as well.  I would stay here again. "
12048,982652,9/3/12,550639,Erika,"Ben was very friendly and communicative from day one. Unfortunately I had to cancel my stay last minute, but judging from our email exchange it would have been a comfortable stay. I would definitely stay with Ben next time I´m in town."

He was very friendly and for my first time visiting New York it was a big help for navigation. With the location of his apartment, near the F train, it's easy to go to Manhattan or Brooklyn. I'll recommend this apartment and I hope go a second time in the future. Thanks for all Ben!"
12048,1061741,30/3/12,108374,William Andrew,"Was moving to NYC and Ben's hospitality and space was just perfect.  His space was clean, well organized and adequate for my needs (a 2-week stay). Oh, and did I mention how close to the Subway was? Just a block away, which made getting home a breeze.  Would definitely book again if need be. Thanks."
12048,1073415,2/4/12,1885483,Jeremy,"Ben was a wonderful and gracious host.  His apartment and my bed were clean, comfortable and worth every penny-a bargain as far as I am concerned.  On my next trip to NYC, Ben will be my first choice for accommodations. "
12048,1088588,6/4/12,1591154,Tony,"Ben was a great host! I chose the couch and it was honestly more comfortable than my own bed. He was very respectful of my messed up partying sleep schedule, haha. Really cool and nice guy, and extremely reliable to contact as well as knowledgeable of the city. Location is great as every day I walked to go meet my friends. You WILL NOT find a cheaper place to stay in Lower East Side. I recommend Ben's place all the way."
12048,1145933,17/4/12,2074295,Katie,"Ben is amazing! He is so friendly and so accommodating with his time and his space. His space, by the way, is very conveniently located, very clean and very cozy. (He even didn't mind when I stayed up watching ""Pretty Woman"" all night!) Extremely flexible and easy going, Ben made for the perfect host. When I first saw the place, I couldn't beat the price, but now that I know Ben, the host, I know that you can't beat his southern-rooted NYC hospitality. I would certainly stay here again!    "
12048,1159640,21/4/12,2025994,Johan,"I stayed at Ben's for 4 days & nights. Ben proved a warm, welcoming, well-informed host. The Couch, apart from providing me with the best sleep during my trip in the US, was a good place for sharing personal stories and interests too, both of which Ben has in abundance. Add the location and his good taste for food (& coffee!) and it's not hard to understand why I rated my stay so highly."
12048,1185616,26/4/12,2107122,Mario,Ben was a great host. When I arrived to NY I knew nothing about it. Ben gave me key tips to grasp the best out of my five-day stay in the city. He was very respectful of privacy and very quite. The apartment was small but enough :). It is only 50 meters away from the East Broadway subway station (line F). Internet worked perfectly (quite a concern for me :)). I would definitively stay again there. Thanks Ben!
12048,1192133,28/4/12,6499,Bill,Ben was a great host and provided a great subway map which helped me navigate the city.

12048,2107895,27/8/12,2469397,Francois,"It was my first time using Air BnB and the experience was awesome. Ben is a great host, friendly, very attentive, very open-minded and a bright person. Although I spent most of our time out, the conversations we had were great ! He was extremely helpful throughout the entire process. He was very responsive to e-mails and very helpful with checkout or when I picked up the keys. His place is clean, quiet and comfortable as described. This apartment puts you in the heart of the LES, where you can walk anywhere and find something awesome. You can find almost everything in the same block and the subway is located at the corner of the street. You get exactly what you expect -, a/c and wifi.  I'd highly recommend Ben and his place ! Definitely a good place to go for a cheap stay in NYC. Great price and location. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Thank you Ben.

I am tall (6'3"" for Americans, 192 CM for everyone else) and I fit well onto the couch, so hopefully that allays any concerns that one may have about the flat. I highly recommend him as a host and his flat for your visiting needs. "
12048,4951025,3/6/13,6492273,Chris,Absolutely perfect. I had a fantastic weekend here. Ben was a fantastic host and really went out of his way to help me enjoy my time in NYC. He gave me lots of information prior to my trip and was extremely helpful while I was there. Ben was kind enough to invite me along to his film festival and to meet some of his colleagues and friends. Made me feel like a native New Yorker! Was a great experience thanks to Bens hospitality and I can't wait to go back. The apartment is in a great spot too. Would thoroughly recommend. Thanks Ben.

12048,5363176,26/6/13,6131705,Paolo,"Stayed on his couch for one night on a layover in New York. Perfect for a one night stay where all you need is a simple place to sleep on. Couch was comfortable and Ben was really helpful, giving tips of where what I could do in the very short time I was in NY and was ok with me checking out a little later and I'm really grateful for that. Recommended for ppl staying just one short night as stopover and are on a budget"
12048,5858385,19/7/13,5812238,Lisa,"Ben was a great host. I booked his apartment for a friend of mine on a very short notice.

12048,6108953,30/7/13,5296504,Jared,"My stay at Ben's place was a brief one, but it went really well and smoothly. Ben is really cool, he's helpful and well experienced with the AirBnB thing.  
I slept on the sofa - its a good size.  I'm about 5 foot 9, and I wasn't squashed at all.  The location is awesome - you're just 5-10 minutes walk from some really hip bars/restaurants.
So I can recommend Ben's place for a nice cheap stay in NY. One thing that might be worth mentioning - there is no A/C.  I would imagine the heat might be a little overwhelming during a heatwave.  He  does have a fan though!
Ben - if you're ever in Melbourne feel free to look me up for a beer.
"

It is conveniently located beside the subway station (2 minutes walk), I a walkable distance to Financial District, Manhattan Bridge, Brooklyn Bridge and East Village. Very safe location.

The place is small, but comfortable with everything you may need for a short stay. It is also clean and everything has its own place there. The place looks exactly like on the pictures.

Ben is a great story teller.

Highly recommended."

He was very accommodating with both a very late check in time and early check out due to my odd travel itinerary. There was a small mix up with booking, so I ended up staying at his friend's place, which was very clean and easy to get to via subway. Overall, the experience was very smooth and Ben was very clear about details every step of the booking. I highly recommend him as a host."

Hope to be back, would definitely recommend. "
12048,10311084,12/2/14,3083301,Wim,"I really enjoyed my stay at Ben's place. Ben responds all the time fast to messages or email and it is very easy to arrange a 'check in' with him. His apartment is small, but everything you'll need for a stay is there. The couch of really comfortable for a few nights! His place is very well located, just 50m from the entrance of the F- line subway. Ben is a nice guy, friendly, enjoys to have a chat with a cup of coffee, but also respects your freedom and privacy! I highly recommend Ben's place when you visit New York!"

The apt is less than half block from the F train which takes you to all nice places in manhattan, such as soho, west village, midtown, etc. If you feel like walking, chinatown, little italy, and financial district are all around. Just cross the street in front of his building and you'll see the one world trade center and the beautifull bridges that ride you to brooklyn. Hope I can stay there again. LES is such a nice place to be.
Thank you Ben!

Ben was a great host as well--flexible, accommodating, friendly, open, and helpful. As a solo traveler for the first time, he helped make my trip much more enjoyable and interesting. Though he was quite busy during my stay, he took the time to provide me recommendations and was genuinely interested in my trip.

As a solo traveler in NYC, it's hard to imagine a better value accommodation. "

He was always willing to help me or give me advice on the city when I needed them and really made much more enjoyable my presence in New York.
The appartment location and neighborhood is excellent to, you have the metro half block away and I came back late some nights and is completely safe.
Totally recommended, especially if you are traveling alone. Is my first experience through airbnb and it was incredibly good.


Ben es un excelente anfitrión. Durante toda la estadía siempre fue más un amigo que una persona que te alquila parte de su casa.
Siempre estuvo dispuesto a ayudarme o darme consejos respecto de la ciudad y realmente hizo muchísima mas agradable mi presencia en New York.
El barrio y la localización del departamento también son excelentes, tenes el metro a media cuadra y aunque algunas noches volví algo tarde la zona es completamente segura.
Total y completamente recomendable, especialmente si estas viajando solo. Esta fue mi primer experiencia en airbnb y fue increíblemente buena."

Each time I have had a problem or a request (which were not linked to him or his flat) he offered to help me immediately.
His flat cannot be closer to the subway, which is very convenient, and Manhattan and Brooklyn can be accessed walking (which I did most of the time). I slept very well at his place, therefore I had great vacations in New York. Definitely recommending Ben’s apartment, it was a great experience!"

"
12048,62678242,15/2/16,25636205,Kelton,I can't say enough good things about staying with Ben. The listing is accurate and Ben has been with AirBnB for 5 years so he knows what he is doing and more importantly knows NYC inside and out. He made my feel right at home and was very helpful in getting me directions to his place.  The location is very safe and close to the subway and Citibike. People like Ben are what make NYC such a pleasure to visit as a first timer or regular.  
12048,63846172,27/2/16,31409727,Dan,"Excellent host. Very organized, responsive professional.  Apartment as described. I was on pull out couch and it was very comfortable! "

Will come back again and also will tell more friends to stay at Ben's place!"
12048,65962352,18/3/16,58062691,Philipp,"perfect organizational talent, Ben! The apartment is wonderful, just what you need for a stay in NYC. Definitely check out the neighborhood, lots of really awesome diners and delis (Dimes, Pies 'n' Things, etc.)"

From the moment I arrived Ben greeted me and gave me some information the area, place to eat, and how the transpiration was in NY. As it was my first experience at an airbnb, i couldn't ask for a better place and host. If you are looking for a place to rest that is near a 20 minute subway ride to time square then Ben's place is the place for you. Thank you Ben for hosting me in NY!  "

12048,78429462,6/6/16,22388487,T Enrico,"Staying at Ben's apartment in Madison St. was really great, very convenient since it is literally few steps away from the F train, the area is relatively safe I felt comfortable going back to the apartment at night or even after midnight. Despite being very busy for work, Ben was very friendly and accommodating, he also gave me privacy in my space. Definitely will book his apartment again. Overall it is a very reasonable and good experience staying at Ben's apartment, I would recommend his place if you will be out most of the time and if you have a tight budget but wants to have a decent and comfortable stay plus Ben also responds quickly to queries.

Los únicos puntos negativos en mi opinión son que el departamento es muy pequeño así que no se esperen privacidad. Además los vecinos son un poco ruidosos."
12048,241282777,8/3/18,137919053,Cameron,"Ben was the man! My experience at Bens air bnb started much before my arrival to his comfy apartment. He was an amazing communicator, giving me tips on food and travel. When I got to his place he hooked me up with everything I needed. We stayed up half the night chillen talking about movies and watching tv. 10/10 experience and happy to say I made a friend along the way."
12048,243609808,16/3/18,90646404,Benjamin,"Ben was really nice, he cared about our comfort and the questions we had. He knows very well the city at daylife and nightlife. I definitely can recommend his place if you want to stay in NYC for a low price and in a very good location inside manhattan."

12048,293070180,19/7/18,113235526,Anand,Ben is very quick in responding. The space is small but very neat and well organized. I did not miss anything. Very close to Metro and the place is perfect for short/overnight trips.

Highly recommend host and space."

12192,15556,29/10/09,43258,Tara,"It's a convenient location, a couple of  blocks from the metro, and Edward is lovely. :) Room is simple but enough, proper bed, and a small window. However, it may not be 100 % comfortable for a girl travelling alone, in terms of bathroom cleanliness or the neighbourhood.. other than that, it's a good stay for that price. comparable to the better hostels in town. "
12192,16156,3/11/09,46014,Simon,"Good spot in my favourite part of town.

good communication, excellent availability and optimum price... therefore, awsome!!!"

Edward did a good job communicating and I had no trouble finding it, getting in, etc, even though I wound up never meeting him.  The building is a little sketch, the place is not particularly clean, but for $40, totally worth it and it's great having some private space to leave your stuff.  Thanks!"

All this for a totally adequate price ! Thank you so much Ed."
12192,17365,15/11/09,41864,Nathan-Linda,"EDWARD - great guy and very helpful in answering any questions that we had.

PRICE - A great bargain!

LOCATION - Very conveniently located to the subway.

ROOM - Great for a short stay _ clean sheets, comfortable bed, and new cool lamp

BATHROOM - OK for a guy, cleanliness needs to improve for the ladies"
12192,18270,25/11/09,52696,Sterling,"Edward is a gracious and helpful host. He made me feel welcome and he helped me get to the know the neighborhood. 

Regarding the apartment, it is fine for a short stay. 

Pros: The building and apartment are very secure, and I was given a key for the apartment, room, and building. 

Cons: It is a basement apartment with a tiny window, so it has a cellar-type feel so the room is best for active travelers who plan to spend their free time exploring the city. 

Regarding cleanliness, I would describe the apartment as slightly weathered, but definitely not dirty or unclean. I wouldn't bring a date to the room, but there really is nothing that should discourage female travelers from this place. 

If you are on business or on vacation I would get a more expensive room but if you are a traveler you will be getting a great value for a secure and private place to sleep. "
12192,19402,6/12/09,58244,Jackie And Vlad,"Affordable and conveniently located near the subway. We just met Edward once (the late night of our arrival in NY) and he was helpful and nice. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom kind of tiny and obviously run by males...But we didn't spend much time in there, so who cares...Great neighborhood, quiet street...We only regret the fact that we couldn't taste a good ramen soup at the Minca Ramen Factory (next door), but we'll do it at one point, that's for sure!    "
12192,19880,11/12/09,24501,Maria,"To tell the truth - it was  our worst stay ever!

The room's locate in the basement (that was not explained in Edward's descriprion and we were struck on coming there after arriving in NY).
A dusty room of a closet size with a tiny window, through wich one can enjoy an unforgettable landscape of stinky trash cans. Don't believe the view of  Manhattan in one of the pics in the room's description. It's fake.

We made a grave mistake when having booked the room for our entire NY vacation (2 weeks). We could hardly spend there a couple of days - in that stuffy room with bed sheets that seemed not to have been cleaned ever.
The last drop was when Masha got an allergy attack and became covered with rash (though no cases of such strengh had take place earlier).

Se, we were forced to move ASAP.

BUT!! Attention - we lost approximately 300$ on it. The AIRBNB compensated only 50 % of the total sum for the rest days with Edward's(yeah, you won't believe!) and detained their fees. We had to urgently find another place through BNB and pay their fee again (is that fair?).

So, please, be careful with this choice!

P.S.On leaving Edward, we stayed at another place - for the same price - it was excellent! "
12192,20874,20/12/09,636921,Marie-Claude,"we had a great time in NYC
we had lots planed and we were gone out for most of the time, so the apartment was only used for sleeping.. for us, that was fine. the cleanliness could be improoved. you get what you pay for...
Edward is a nice and helpful guy. "
12192,22790,3/1/10,51163,Sunny,We had a fantastic stay at Edward's place. Room was very simple and was all we needed. What made our trip best was Edward and they way he was able to make our stay so amazing. Thanks for showing us all the cool places in NY and making our stay so comfortable. Anyone staying at Edward's must go to the roof top for the amazing view of NY.  Such a great location too. So easy to get anywhere from East village.  Make sure to go to the amazing Two Boots pizza place just a block away.

12192,45628,24/5/10,90294,David,"I spent 33 days at Edward's place and I thank him for making his home available.  

The room was clean and adequate for what I needed, somewhere to sleep, write my notes and make my water colour sketches and other mini artworks (and the bathroom and kitchen were always available also) ---.  

East Village is an excellent location to get the feel of New York with Edward's place in the Village being central to other areas of interest in New York for me.

Once I got my ""New York Feet"" I found it very easy to move around Manhattan from Edward's on foot and then I graduated to riding on the Great New York Subways with stations close by Edward's place ---.

Edward is a genuinly delightful humanist, he was very helpful with any questioins I had and I wish him every success in his career as stage actor.

Thank you Edawrd for the discussions we had (often into the early hours of the morning) I consider you a friend and who knows maybe in year or so I'll be back ---.

I have no hessitaion in recommending staying at Edwrad's place and in closing Edward has a saying ""Enjoy"".  I did - and you will.

12192,96621,14/9/10,126621,Caroline & Jean,"This apartment was really the bad side of our trip in NY, we advise you against it at all costs. 

When we arrived, we saw the real lack of windows (in fact the apartment is in a kind of basement), and it was not really clean, overall the bathroom.  But the room seemed to be clean (sheets and towels clean).
It was ok for us, because we only stayed there for sleeping. 

After a few days, we saw cockroaches in the bathroom, there were more and more until we left.

The worst arrived when I discovered mouse's droppings in our room. After a few days, we saw the mouse in the kitchen, and the last night was really terrible : we didn't sleep at all, hearing the mouse walking in our room, and saw it on our bags...

Edward was in holidays and wasn't there during our 10 days in NY, but was available by email, and was really nice... but that didn't solve anything, the apartment was dirty and we wanted to stay there the less time possible. "
12192,100847,20/9/10,178662,Eric,"Edward and his place are exactly what you're looking for in NYC. That is if you want a communal, clean and simple crash pad, an outgoing and gracious host who is will make sure you find everything you need, and piles of interesting eye and mind candy (and food, drinks, bodegas) within walking distance. "
12192,120727,17/10/10,233233,Noldus,"Edward is a really nice guy and very flexible regarding time. We arrived at a time Edward was working, so he couldn't be there to give us the key, but he arranged for us to pick up the key upstairs so we could drop off our stuff. Checking out was easy as well; we could leave our stuff at his place untill we actually left New York.
The room is perfect for when you're staying for a couple of days and just need a place to sleep. The bathroom really reflects it being in a basement (pipe running through the room, a bit rusty and I saw some small bugs), but this was no problem for us. Oh and the towels we're nice and soft! :D"
12192,130047,30/10/10,254068,Thomas,"Ed is a great guy - the room is very modest but serviceable.  It also has a lock and key, so you can leave your stuff there.  Keep in mmind that these buildings are rather dated, so this is a basic living arrangement.  The area is really quite cool and has a funky vibe to it - lots of cool cafes and coffee shoppes, lots of young folks with a great chill attitude."
12192,139040,15/11/10,230942,Benjamin,"My partner and I have stayed with Edward twice now. He's a great host, his cat a serious bonus, the space is clean, and the neighborhood is alive! For the price, this accommodation can't be beat! "
12192,150269,7/12/10,186665,Laura,"Edouard offre une chambre pas chère pour une ville telle que NY en plein East Village. La chambre est correcte et propre. Edouard a été disponible et toujours prêt à nous aider durant notre voyage.

"
12192,169619,11/1/11,339872,Eva Laura,"The place is very great and Edward is a very great guy as well. It is a very friendly, nice environment. I was definitely lucky to have stayed here. 
"
12192,172045,18/1/11,326842,Lesley,"Edward was an amazing host who is knowledgeable and friendly - the room is perfect if you need a place to crash and is close to so many great bars, cafes and restaurants.  I would stay there again anytime!"
12192,173652,23/1/11,176501,Andrew,"Edward's apartment is perfectly located in the East Village, close to just about everything I wanted to do and everywhere I wanted to go. The apartment itself is a small basement unit that gets very little light. But that wasn't an issue since I was barely there during my three nights stay. It was the ideal place for me to drop my stuff off, go out, come back to for sleeping and showering. 

I met Edward for a brief time. He was really nice and courteous, much like his cat Joshua, who was very friendly and playful. 

All in all, a good and comfortable experience. "
12192,187084,22/2/11,334659,Dan,"Great location and price, Edwards' a champ and I highly recommend it as an alternative to hostels or more expensive options.  I had a bit of work to do and it was quiet and peaceful there as well.

Cheers Edward!"
12192,191884,3/3/11,403674,Sara,"Edward was extremely accommodating, left his keys at the restaurant downstairs so I wouldn't have to drag my luggage around until he was off work.  His cat is adorable by the way.  Would definitely recommend staying there!"
12192,196792,11/3/11,415067,Klaus,"Ed is a great host and a very open-minded person. I stayed six nights there - the room is small but the price is awesome when you consider that you are in the middle of crazy hopping East Village!
Klaus - Denmar"
12192,204896,21/3/11,401454,Jens,"I had a great time in NY staying with Edward. Edward, his girlfriend and Dennis (the guy living next to me) are nice and helping people. They know the neighborhood and all the good places to go and they're happy to share. So if you're a tourist like me, ask them where to go and what to see."
12192,227060,15/4/11,433888,Isabel,"Definitely a place for 'backpackers'. A bargain for NYC! Excellent location, near to the coolest places of the East Village and easy to get in and out by Subway & Bus. 

Edward is a very nice person, respectful, easy-going and ready to answer your questions.  The room is fine, very comfortable bed and we even found there a very interesting guide for New York that we used a lot. 

The only DOWNSIDE of the place are the bath and kitchen amenities that you share, which are not always in the best conditions. Since it's a basement and there's lots of humidity, you may find bugs or moisture in both. So be warned if you can't stand bugs or small insects (roaches)... you could be surprised when going to pee at night. If you are OK with this GO ahead and book! "
12192,232946,20/4/11,396445,Benjamin,The bed was good and Edward is a very nice host.
12192,254294,7/5/11,438708,Boele,"Price/quality is good. We recomment this place.
We have had a very nice and pleasant week at Edward's place. He and  his girlfriend are very nice people. The room was small and dark, but then again, we were not in NY to stay in the room all the time. We enjoyed the wifi and the tv in the room. 
The only remakrs are that the apartment is very dark and could be a little cleaner.
The neighborhood is very nice with lots of nice bars, restaurants and deli's. It is about 10 minutes walk from the subway to the apartment.
Edward, thanks for a nice week!"
12192,261665,13/5/11,449698,Trey,"Ed's place is great for the cost. It's a sweet location and I never had any trouble getting back to it. It's smaller, but I'd have to describe it more ""cozy"" than I would ""cramped."" Everything was in good order and there were even magazines and cool guide books to seeing the city. I dug it. 

As for the host himself, Ed was great. He wasn't intrusive nor was he elusive. Very kind and helpful with suggestions of things to do.  Down to Earth friendly guy. I'm glad it worked out so well. This was my first time ever using Airbnb and I had no idea what to expect. I can only hope that all my future trips work out like this one! "
12192,284574,28/5/11,349394,Marie,"Edward was a wonderful host ! 
The room is great, private and all. Ask anything to Edward, he knows a lot of stuff about the city, what to do, you can find guides in the room, etc etc. So great !
The bathroom is a little bit small, but overall it's still a great !
The appartment is in a basement, you have to go through a backyard/garbage hall to get in, but once you're there it's OK. Located in a vibrant neighborhood of the city, very nice to wander in !
The basement location can feel cramped or such to some people, but really, if you come to visit NyC, you don't want to stay in your room all the time ;-)
Overall, a bargain for the location, a real great value, and Joshua (the cat) is so cuute and friendly !
Highly recommended for a good quality/price ratio !

"
12192,289806,31/5/11,456678,Larry,"Great room and apartment, and Edward is a very thoughtful, helpful and friendly host.  Location is pretty good, too (near pleasant restaurants, several minutes walk from a subway stop).  The only problem is outside of the apartment:  the courtyard and hallways you have to walk through to get to Edward's place are full of loose garbage."
12192,309400,12/6/11,415978,Raphaëlle,"We enjoyed our stay by Edward's. First experience with airbnb and definitely not the last!
Edward is a friendly and helpful host. The appartment is in a basement, the room quite small but very clean and comfortable! The location is perfect to enjoy NYC especially by night. The price is amazing for travellers with low budget!"
12192,315068,14/6/11,672671,Jane,"Edward's place is in a fabulous part of the city!  The price was a steal for a place in Manhattan.  The sheets were clean and the atmosphere quiet and chill.  Edward is very easy to get in contact with, super friendly and a great host.  He offers up everything - towels, NYC books, kitchen, fridge, tea, house keys - that you need to make your trip comfortable.
Although the room is clean, the guest bedroom's window is ground-level on a garbage-filled alley, so if the window/fan is left open, the smell in the room will reflect what is going on outside - one evening we could smell vomit (however, the next day no problems). To avoid this, keep the window closed if it's not hot."
12192,372320,14/7/11,663515,Angelo,"I had a really great time at Edward's place, him and Kara were amazing and we got along pretty well. They are amazing people and I felt so comfortable in the house because even if it isn't big it felt cozy and cool for me.
I would definitely keep in touch with both of them and I really hope to see them in the near future."
12192,388644,22/7/11,662938,Alexandre,"Edward a été accueillant disponible lorsque nous en avions besoin. 
L'appartement est bien situé à East Village, le point négatif est qu'il se situe en demi-sous-sol et qu'il est donc sombre. "
12192,423240,6/8/11,647469,Luca,Good and cheap location to visit Manahattan.
12192,446795,15/8/11,844958,Mahala,"Hey! Was really great meeting the guys, very nice to stay over, the area is great. Definitely a place to stay!!

Thanks Edward!!
"
12192,519855,11/9/11,598316,Don'T Book,"Edward is an awesome guy, I only met him briefly as he was going to Cali but he was always generous helpful and welcoming on every occasion we met. His room mate Denis is lovely aswell, always happy to stop and have a chat. The room and apartment are exactly like they are in the photos on the website. Perfect for me, in a great location, close to a lot of little deli shops and a laundrette. The East Village comedy club is just around the corner and the view from the room alone is enough to take this apartment. I stayed here for a month and loved every min of it. No complaints at all. "
12192,611105,9/10/11,850712,Rob,"We had a good time with Edward and his (Hidden by Airbnb) who were really friendly, laid-back and helpful. The room is pretty basic and doesn't get much natural light but it's comfortable, clean and fairly quiet - perfect if you just need a bed and an internet connection. The location is fantastic and overall it's a really good value place to stay"
12192,630616,16/10/11,1014805,Sven,"Preis und Leistung sind angemessen
allerdings sollte man mit seiner Partnerin nicht unbedingt  dort übernachten da es doch sehr einfach ist.Wer ansprüche hat sollte woanders buchen. Der Gastgeber war nett  und man kann in 30 minuten den Timesquare erreichen . 
Es war sauber allerdings gab es im Bad kleine Mitbewohner (Ka....)"
12192,728578,18/11/11,12458,Charles,I always love staying in the Lower East Side. It's close to some of my favorite eateries.  Ed's place is simple and no frills but you get a private room with a queen bed in a great location.  What more can you ask for? I would definitely stay there again.
12192,760237,3/12/11,431849,Karelia,"Great room! The location is awesome, walking distance to everything great downtown, on a quiet street. Edward and Kara are extremely nice and helpful, and their cats are so sweet! Tidy place, small kitchen area to share, can get a bit hot at times with the water pipes but crank up the fan and you'll be fine. I definitely recommend it and would stay there again. Thanks!"
12192,766112,5/12/11,1247267,Eileen,"Great place and awesome hosts! Perfect location, close to everything in the EV and very accessible. The room was clean and comfortable and all the basic necessities were covered. Fun loving cats with great personalities too, very entertaining. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back. "
12192,782269,13/12/11,885727,Rob,"Myself and my gf stayed over the first week of december.

Good points:

The shower worked with hot water and the bed was comfortable, Edward and his room mate were really friendly and helpful.
Location is great with many resturants and bars nearby that do happy hours, half the price of midtown. Tube is 10 mins walk away which wasn't too bad. 

Negatives:

Room temperature was up and down, some nights it was cold, other nights very hot.
For two people (who did quite alot of shopping) we struggled for space in the room however I would see it as perfect for a lone traveller or for people with not alot of stuff.

If you don't like cats then I would not recommend staying there, you cannot avoid the litter tray and the friendly inqusitive cats!"
12192,982342,9/3/12,1553145,Calame,"Edouard et Kara ont été formidable tous les deux. Extrêmement arrangeant puisqu'ils nous ont hébergés chez eux dans leur nouvel appartement pour une nuit.

L'appartement est idéalement situé (East Village) et permet l'accès à pied aux incontournable de Manhattan. 

Seul bémol (que de l'eau chaude dans la baignoire :) "
12192,1016270,19/3/12,1504406,Johannes,"It was a small room in the basement, not that much daylight but very peaceful and quiet. The temperature was either very hot or chilly. Still very   affordable and Edward was always nice and helpful when we needed help."
12192,1036317,24/3/12,1563324,Marie,"Edward has been very nice, reliable and helpful with recommendations on where to eat and what to do in NYC. The room is clean and very functional. There was enough space for my luggage, a very comfortable bed and everything I needed, even a TV. The bathroom has a good shower with constant hot water. The best thing about the apartment is its location. It's located in the east village, a nice and vibrant neighborhood, close to sweet shops, plenty of restaurants, NYU, subway stations... I can totally recommend staying there if you look for an inexpensive place to sleep and relax in Manhattan."
12192,1085265,5/4/12,1662936,Adrian,"Definitely the genuine NYC experience here!
This is the perfect place for those looking for convenient, inexpensive & no-fuss accommodation. Edward was a gracious host, quick to respond to any queries I had & only too happy to play guide & share information to a traveller.
Would try to book again when I return, such a unique vibe!"
12192,1176777,25/4/12,1639535,Benjamin,"What an odd little place.  It's exactly as described - a very small place buried in the basement at the back of a larger apartment building. Apparently there are lots of apartments in NYC just like this, so you'll really get a feel of what it's like to be a typical New Yorker that doesn't work on Wall St.  It's a great place to crash, but don't expect to get too comfortable (who wants to stay inside when you're in NYC, anyway?).  The bed was a bit on the firm side, and my girlfriend ended up buying a small mat to take the edge off and it was fine.  One thing to be aware of: sometimes the heat in the building is turned on, and since the main line radiator pipes pass through the apartment, it can get really hot in there really fast.  We walked in from 50 degrees and raining to a dry 90 degrees inside the apartment!  Once we got the fan and the window unit rolling, it became comfortable enough, so it wasn't any big deal.  Overall the place is super functional, not fancy, and perfectly located close to just about everything.

Edward was a gracious host, and gave us a few tips of where to go and where to catch some good food in the neighborhood.  

I'd recommend this place to anyone who is looking to spend most of their  time exploring the city, isn't too concerned with creature comforts, and doesn't want to spend a lot of money.  Thanks, Edward!"
12192,1200703,30/4/12,1859022,Madeline,"Edward was such a great host! The place is exactly as it looked, and Edward was really accommodating about letting me check in and out when it was convenient to my friend and me. I would definitely stay here again -- you can't beat the price or the location."
12192,1240308,7/5/12,1907767,Jean-Marc,"Semaine très agréable. 
Nous n'avons croisé Edward qu'une fois (très sympathique) mais il était très disponible par mail, par téléphone.
Bon emplacement de l'appart et bon rapport qualité/prix."
12192,1356414,27/5/12,1468796,Lilian,"Hosts Kara and Edward were super lovely and happy to help. The room is rather small..well, for someone like me who had 2 big suitcases, a carry on and a big bag. For someone who wanted a room and a fairly big bed with a bit of room, no problem. It wasn't really a problem for me either. I'm pretty easy when it comes to things like this. It was just a bed for me to sleep in really. Big clean bed. Comfy. No natural light in room though. I didn't spend much time in there as i was too busy seeing NYC. Bathroom was small but do-able. I'm only little. I'd say the place was quite clean. I caught Edward cleaning out the rooms once people had left to change the sheets, etc and clean the kitchen and bathroom and vaccum, so i was pleased. There were however a few cockroaches which have seen roaming around in the room and bathroom. No biggie though. The room has some hangers for your clothes if you need them. I didn't use them. There is a tv and a dvd player which i didn't use either. There is a small bedside table with a few drawers if you need it and there's a mirror too. It's not a hotel room so don't expect too much but is perfect for the simple traveller like myself who really just wanted a bed in a nice location. It's safe and it's near the corner of 5th St and Avenue A. There is a supermarket a block away and i always walked to 14th street to catch the L train to get to places. I thought the area was close to everything i needed. Kara was helpful when i arrived and waited until i got there as i got a little lost. Met some lovely people who lived in the room next to me too. This is my first time using airbnb so i didn't know what to expect, but i'll surely be using it again!

Only minusing points for the small room and cockroaches :) Though, i'm sure the small room part was already stated so that's my fault.

Thanks Ed and Kara!"
12192,1474225,13/6/12,2049694,Paul,"We had a great stay here. The room is quaint but exactly what you need, and super peaceful for something in Manhattan! The area has a great vibe, with cafes, bars and restaurants all at close reach. The burger bar next door was quite possibly the best burger bar I went to whilst in NYC. 

Edward is super friendly, helpful and accommodating; and has some great stories to share of all the people that have stayed there.

Definitely recommend this for people looking for cheap and convenient. "
12192,1598536,30/6/12,758311,Pben,Very accommodating on short notice. Fast responses. Great place thank you  
12192,1634984,5/7/12,633678,Cindi,The only good thing about this place is the location. 
12192,1692352,12/7/12,2730212,Ani,"My boyfriend and I stayed with Edward for two nights recently and we were both happy with the experience. The room was cool enough to sleep on two hot days in July, aided by the fact that it is a basement apartment and Edward’s fan set up. The towels and sheets were clean and seemed to have been purchased relatively recently and the common space was tidy. Edward was very nice, stopping to talk with us for a few minutes when we first go to the city and when we were on our way out. If he were in my city I would certainly meet up with him again. 
The only downside I can think of is that the tiny bathroom was not quite as clean as I could have preferred, but it was fine and had everything we needed. The room wasn’t big, but the bed was firm and comfortably slept the two of us. It was also nice that the door to the room locked, so we felt safe leaving our suitcases there while we were out. The location was the high point for sure, as we were easily able to walk through the majority of lower manhattan, catch the subway, and on our last day we got a cab to the airport in no time. 
I hope this is helpful to anyone considering staying with Edward. Have a good time!"
12192,1719160,16/7/12,2441440,Bryan,"I stayed here with my girlfriend for four nights. Edward was terrific and the room and apartment were exactly as described. Edward is more than accommodating with any of your needs and is a wonderful host. The apartment's location in the East Village is great. NYU, Washington Square Park and great East Village stores, restaurants and boutiques were all within walking distance. The Delancy St and 2nd Av subway stations are both close by. From there, you can reach almost anywhere in NYC in 30 minutes or less. While the apartment is not luxurious, you are close to just about anything you'd want to do in NYC. Also, Edward gave us great info on where to eat, how to get places and what things to do in the city. Highly recommend staying here for anyone planning to visit New York. The experience was great. "
12192,1759281,21/7/12,2094298,Audrey,"Nous avons été accueillis par un ami d'Edward car celui-ci était parti faire du camping. Là, mauvaise surprise : le logement, que nous avions compris comme étant un rez-de-chaussée, était en fait une cave dans une cour pleine d'ordures, de poubelles, et de meubles usagés.
""L'appartement"" ne comportait aucune fenêtre, aucune aération, était vraiment d'une propreté douteuse, le frigo ne marchait pas...Le premier soir en faisant la cuisine, nous avons eu la désagréable surprise de rencontrer un cafard, puis deux, puis trois...Pareil dans la cour où ils pullullaient. Le deuxième soir, nous nous sommes aperçus qu'il y avait des puces dans la literie, donc nous sommes partis. Alors que nous avions payé pour cinq nuits.
Nous n'avons jamais rencontré Edward, qui nous a quand même envoyé un mail pour savoir s'il y avait un problème...
J'oublie : les rencontres avec les clochards du coin qui se lavent au jet dans la cour ou qui fouillent dans les poubelles quand vous sortez le matin. 
 Même si elle est éminemment bien placée dans NY (quoique l'East Village prenne des allures de cour des miracles en journée, avec des rassemblements de marginaux), peu chère, et pas loin des transports et d'une supérette, une adresse absolument à éviter donc, sauf si l'on est un routard très très très endurci."
12192,1826959,29/7/12,2096317,Benjamin,"Edward was a great host! friendly and very relaxed. Our expierence there was great! the department is located in a really convenient place. Even though it doesn't seem too luxurious at first sight, it is very confortable and it has everything you need."
12192,1961242,12/8/12,3141512,Blake,"Edward really made the most of this small basement apartment. He was very accommodating, and The place made for a nice stay."
12192,2132495,29/8/12,2262995,Marion,"First of all, I put 3 stars to our stay, but I could have put 2 or 4 stars. Edward is a really kind person, he really takes care of his guests. But the apartment is not so good ! The appartment is really dark, there are few cockroaches, the bathroom is quite old and not so perfectly clean! BUT, the apartment has a great location and for this price you can't find any hotel in NYC. For students, it's a quite good location !  "
12192,2238564,9/9/12,2990116,Stephan,"My brother and I stayed in NYC for one week and we were really happy with the apartment. It's located right in the middl of East Village which is a very good place for people who love bars, pubs and restaurants. Also, it's just a 5 min walk away from the subway station, so you can go anywhere in no time.
Edward was very helpful with giving us directions, especially when I first called him at the airport. We met up twice, so he told us some more things about where to go and what to do.
Altogether, I really recommend this apartment."
12192,2743391,29/10/12,2574253,Mirjam,"We stayed with Edward for 2 weeks and we had a great experience. The room and apartment provides you with all the basic things you need in NYC. The apartment is located in the basement of a very popular part of town where there are always things to do and is close to the tourist shopping and sightseeing areas. Edward gave us tips about where to go and provided us with a subway map and tourist guide. Edward was a great host, we could reach him anytime if we had questions or needed some info about something. Overall, a great experience"
12192,2824077,7/11/12,3501231,Del & Felicity,"Edward was very friendly, helping carry our heavy bags down to the room & providing maps/ nyc guides. The east village is an awesome location, surrounded by quirky little restaurants & bars & fairly close to the subway. Our stay was affected by hurricane sandy & he was very quick with communication due to travel changes that occurred. The room was small but comfortable, bed linen & towels provided were nice."
12192,2990686,29/11/12,3684560,Peter,"Edward and his girlfriend did everything to make our stay very welcome and enjoyable.
The apartment is very simple and we only used it to sleep and if you want it for that reason it's okay. It is not a place to spent much time, because it's dark and not too cosy. At night (in winter) it is very warm and there is not much daylight. The privacy is not high because we shared the kitchen and bathroom with another (by the way: a very friendly man) resident (which was not mentioned).
The place is clean en kept tidy good enough. The neighbourhood is friendly and nice, and there are some good cafes (the croissant cafe is excellent!) and coffeeshops and stores.
We recommend the place for those who want a very affordable place to sleep and shower and who do not want topquality or luxury.

Our experience is that we had a good host who gave us value for money and above all: who was friendly and generous.

Thanks Edward for the experience!"
12192,3077838,12/12/12,575290,Jason,"Edward was very cool about letting me and my friend check in earlier in the morning, having just jumped off an overnight redeye flight from LA.  Very easy going, gave me a quick rundown of things to enjoy the apartment and our stay.  We were not home often so I didn't really see Edward after but he made it clear that we can call him if we needed anything.  Great location!  And as his description said, he did have roommates and they were cool and friendly!  I'd definitely come back here again."
12192,3314273,9/1/13,3377098,Sonia,"Very good experience in the flat of Edward ! it was very nice to met him ! It's a very nice ""hote"" ! "
12192,3740422,10/3/13,504513,Deborah,"Edward was a great host: good communication even before booking and throughout stay. And he is a very nice guy!
The room was exactly as pictured. It is very basic but had everything I needed.  I was going to be out enjoying the city and wanted a clean, safe place to shower, sleep, and charge my phone. I wasn't planning on hanging out in the apartment, so location and price were much more important to me than having a deluxe spa accommodation. The location is great: lots of good food within walking distance (even on the same block), supermarket 1 block away, post office nearby, deli on the corner. Easy access to the subway. The apartment does not get a lot of natural light and the tub is old so the undercoat shows through the porcelain even when it is scrubbed. For such a fabulous location at such a reasonable price that was fine with me. (as they say, "" Location, Cheap, Fancy: pick 2"") This would not be a place I would send my (conservative, suburban, corporate) parents to, but if you are young, hip, and on a budget this will put you in the middle of all the East Village/Alphabet city/ Lower East Side action. 
Edward is very honest, reliable and up front, so if you are not sure if this is for you, ask him your questions and he will give you a straight answer. For what I wanted (cheap, safe & awesome location) it was great!"
12192,3768856,12/3/13,5167375,Nora,"Edward's place was perfectly located! That was the good point. Edward was also quite available for us. Some other points are not so good. The room is in a basement but the air is very bad, or you get so hot you can't sleep, or you get so cold that it wakes you up too! The bathroom was not easy to use. It was old but also dirty and lots of hairs left in the bath and in the sink... Quite disgusting, even the roaches were running out of the bathroom... You also had to go through the trashes backyard to get to the basement. Well, we could handle two nights, but more woud have been harder! You pay for the location, not for the place!"
12192,3928706,28/3/13,5170494,Sigmund,Great host. Nice and affordable room. 
12192,4322508,28/4/13,5190928,Gisela M,"The apartment was as described in the photos, the neighbourhood very quiet and safe, surrounded by lots of shops and bars. The room was very small, but it was enough to leave our cases and go out all day. The bed was great, very comfortable and soft sheets.. we could sleep with no issues. The kitchen had all what was neccesary, microwave, electric oven, fridge working perfectly. Dennis received us into the apartment and then we met Edward, both great guys who helped us everytime we needed. "
12192,4503399,9/5/13,5244800,Christina,"My best friend and I stayed in Edward's apartment for 5 nights. He has been very nice, reliable and helpful. The room is clean and very functional. There was enough space for our luggage, a very comfortable bed and everything we needed. The best thing about the apartment is its location. It's located in the east village, close to sweet shops, plenty of restaurants, subway stations... I can totally recommend staying there if you look for an inexpensive place to sleep in Manhattan.
"
12192,4546656,12/5/13,287667,Carrie,"Edward was very nice; the place was clean.  It is a basement flat. There were rodents in the basement courtyard.  There was a ""regular roomer"" Dennis who was very nice and helpful and two other people from Australia.  A very good  deal for the price.  The neighborhood is full of good value restaurants and  it is safe.  Enjoy!"
12192,4665398,19/5/13,5571460,Mark,Edward is a great host. Very helpful and accommodating. Location is perfect in a very safe neighbourhood. The apartment was exactly as described. Highly recommended!
12192,4769580,25/5/13,4603228,Satu And Mikko,Best thing about this appartment is the location!! Lots of restaurants and bars in the area and really nice atmosphere in the evening. The room was good for sleeping. Bathroom was quite wet as some water dropped on the floor despite of the shower curtain and the other guests didn't bother to dry the floor. Edward was really nice and helpful host.
12192,4886376,31/5/13,5304630,Lea,"I had a very nice stay at Edward's place. He waited for me til late for my arrival, he is very nice, even if we didnt have the opportunity to talk more.
The bed is confy, there is the AC if it is too warm.
The place is exactly what you need for a week to visit NYC.
"
12192,4929317,2/6/13,6039776,Cullen,"Edward is a great host and a really cool guy to talk with. The apartment is in a great neighborhood, close to public transportation, easy to get a cab, lots of food and bars/pubs. In fact when I got there, the bar next door had put ads in front of his apt for a first free microbrew... Sold! Great way to get things started. The room is not bad, very functional, has a tv if you want to watch it. Bathroom is small, but hello, this is NY, all living spaces are small. Edward's roommate Dennis was also a really cool guy to talk to. Overall, a great experience and I'd strongly recommend to any of my friends who are visiting the city. "
12192,5063464,10/6/13,6504989,Alex,"Edward was great. He worked with me to find a good check in time to accommodate both of our travel plans and was a really great guy to talk to, even though we never had the pleasure of meeting in person. He seems really nice. The apartment was in a fantastic location for the price - plenty to do nearby and easy to get to other parts of the city as well. The room is in a basement apartment = absolutely no natural light. It also seemed to be more humid inside the apartment than outside, which was surprising every single time I got back. However, there is a window ac unit in the kitchen that worked and successfully cooled the place down. The bathroom wasn't that clean, and you had to walk through the garbage courtyard thing to get to the front door. However, it was easy to look past all of this for the price/location. This room would be best for people who want a convenient, cheap location in Manhattan and only need a place to sleep and leave their belongings. Overall it was a fantastic choice for me. "
12192,5636276,9/7/13,5909464,Jesus,"It was a very nice place to stay and comfortable as well, my friend and I liked the place, plus is very well located and more importantly, safe. Though we only see Edward once he is a very cool guy. "
12192,5736211,14/7/13,6249555,Anouck,"We stayed at Edward's place for five nights, he was a great host ! The apartment is in the perfect place to see all downtown and midtown (on foot for the bravest ;) ), we really appreciated that !
Thank you Edward for your welcome !"
12192,5836688,18/7/13,7413361,Tim,"Edward was a good host. Cool guy and accommodating. The place was as advertised, and no surprises is a good thing. The only thing guests should be aware of is that one of the rooms doesn't have AC (don't worry, no false advertising about that). Overall, good location and decent place for the price. "
12192,6271933,6/8/13,6129225,John,"Good guy, nice and simple place,  quiet,  cheap,  private,  convenient spot, enjoyable ."
12192,7154124,9/9/13,5575547,Francesca Romana,"An amazing experience for me and my friends. We stayed in Edward's place more than a month and we found a great hospitality, friendship and courtesy. Edward was so nice and very available with us. The apartment is comfortable and quite. It's in the heart of the East Village close everything you need and about ten minutes walk from the subway. I recommend it to all people that wants to stay in a friendly place. Thanks for everything. I enjoyed my stay in my loved New York!!!"
12192,7711673,30/9/13,8732166,Todd,A modest room in a good location and very reasonable priced for staying in Manhattan. Everything was clean and prepared and Edward was an excellent host.
12192,7980979,11/10/13,8293841,Marian,"Edward fue muy acogedor, nos explicó todo lo que necesitamos.
Tuvimos un pequeño problema en la casa, que Edward no tardó nada en solucionar. Muy buena atención! 
La casa es muy básica, localizada en zona tranquila y sin ruidos.
Para repetir!"
12192,8024276,13/10/13,3202511,Kim,"Edward was a great host, friendly and communicative.  The listing was exactly as advertised- an (extremely) comfortable bed, clean linens, and fantastic location.  "
12192,8428217,30/10/13,4317706,Lexi,"If you've found this place it's because you're looking a budget apartment with all the basics, and that's exactly what you will get. 

It is well-located and secure (the neighbourhood as well as the apartment / room). There is a full kitchen, bathroom and desk available to use. The bed is comfortable and the door locks, the neighbourhood is quiet except for emergency sirens, but you get them everywhere. 

It is perfect as a launching pad to explore the east side and greater Manhattan. It's about a 10min walk to the subway. And walking distance from lower east side (LES) district & east village which means lots of bars, coffee shops, vintage and boutique clothes. 

Edward doesn't live there any more but is very friendly and facilitated the check in with ease (he has been doing this for years) and gave us a few tips. The building manager lives there but you won't see him very very often. 

A few downsides:
- as a basement apartment there is no natural light , so not good vibe if you're spending lots of time in there (but why would you be??)
- like all older buildings in NY, the heating turns on / off based on outside temp, so sometimes it is too cold or too hot
- because access is via the interior courtyard, you have to walk past rubbish dumps to get in (on rubbish days)
- a few baby cockroaches around, also unavoidable in basement apartments. The apartment itself is clean and well kept. 
- we had a problem with the draft coming through the window because of the new AC unit but Edward is going to fix it. 

All in all, great value, not for the fussy traveller, but great for anyone who is keen to get immersed in NYC and wants a safe place to sleep at night!

12192,8522502,4/11/13,7652628,Sébastien,"appartement tres bon marche qui rempli a la perfection son role.
Edward est charmant, sympathique disponible et donne de precieux conseils sur le quartier.
la chambre est propre les draps sont changes avant et apres notre depart.
Edward laisse l acces libre a son ordinateur.

Thank you very much Edward"
12192,8612584,8/11/13,2427098,Valentin,"We enjoyed our trip at Edward's place. The apartment is in a great location, close to everything. No noise in the room, we can drop off the suitcase for the last day. Edward cleaned the room and changed the sheets before that we moved in! Thanks"
12192,8852522,21/11/13,10034474,Mark,Edward is a great guy.  I only used the place to shower and sleep and felt very safe.  The neighborhood is quiet and has a great ramen place right next to it.  Would stay again!

12192,9006426,1/12/13,6441094,Pablo,"I stayed at this location from 11/27 - 11/30.  Edward was a good host...clean sheets, offered suggestions, access to Internet and bed was real comfortable.  Not far from subway station and about a 15 minute walk from great bars and restaurants.  Overall, a great stay "
12192,9092050,6/12/13,9955250,Joe,"Edward's lower east side apartment was perfect for what we were looking for: good, safe location, near subway/bus, clean bed, shower, a place to keep our stuff and CHEAP! This small basement flat has a kitchen if you like to cook for yourself, there is space in two other bedrooms but we had the place to ourselves almost the whole time we were there. The key hand-off was great and Edward accommodated our early arrival with no difficulty. There is a lot to do in the immediate vicinity & awesome ramen 10 ft from the front door (Minca, yum!). Thanks for making our stay in New York so great, Edward. "
12192,9702617,6/1/14,9021195,Jamit,"its convenience to everywhere
good for short stay"
12192,10057401,27/1/14,11586808,Sara,"Edward was incredibly easy to work with. He is very attentive at answering his phone. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and it felt very home-y. This is a great place to stay if you want to explore Manhattan- very accessible to most forms of transportation. I'd definitely recommend this room to any traveler, and should I come back to NYC any time soon, I'll be checking with Edward first when making reservations."
12192,10208528,6/2/14,6281771,Alex,"Cheap, easy-going and in a great location. It was snowing outside and the room was still really warm. Great for anyone who only needs a place to sleep, wash and store their belongings. "
12192,10254460,9/2/14,4336176,Richard,"Slightly confused on when I arrived how to get into the building, and who to contact. Other than that, absolutely wonderful experience and location. Probably one of the quietest blocks in NYC, right next to one of the best ramen restaurants "
12192,10392419,17/2/14,11509977,Hannah,"This was our first stay in New York and our first time using AirBnB so we don't have much to compare it to, but Edward was very friendly and accommodating. We were forced to stay an extra day because of the terrible weather and he even offered us a discount on the last night we stayed. The location is cool, there is a great burger shop attached to the building and bar down the street. The subway was nearby and the neighborhood was very interesting and safe. Definitely the best possible experience for someone looking to really get to know the city."
12192,10733394,4/3/14,12590049,Adrien,I went by Edward for the week-end. His apartment is conveniently located clean and affordable. Good deal.
12192,11092226,20/3/14,9757383,Izaura,"Edward was extremely kind and helpful. In the first moment we had a little issue with communication (most part we were the guilt), but he solved it, and we have absolutely nothing to complain about him. Actually, we are very thankfull for his support.

The place is tiny, but (as the title says) cozy and clean. The neighborhood is great, and we really enjoyed all the options we had to buy things.

I recommend.
"
12192,11246023,26/3/14,11665021,Brittany,"Had an AMAZING time in New York City thanks to the hospitality of Edward and Dennis, the Super.  The bed is literally like sleeping in a hug.  The best bed to sleep in  after hitting up the city.  Very close to everything the city has to offer.  It felt like our own place, which was wonderful.  Edward was very accommodating and always made contact to make sure we were comfortable.  Unlimited hot water for showers!  Always a plus!  The best first experience with AirB&B one could ask for."
12192,11363516,31/3/14,11118570,Tanjira,"We enjoyed our stay - the apartment is centrally located in the cool east village, room was warm& comfy provided a good night sleep. Edward is really friendly and a great conversationalist! He was flexible with our check in/ out time and always helpful. Thank u ! "

The location is very good it isn't crowed area filled with tourists, so you can stay the usual life in NYC. I highly recommend staying there. Thank you for wonderful so many experiences there! His Apt is nice atmosphere, clean room, bed is super comfortable. Thanks, Edward!!!"
12192,11795115,15/4/14,2258824,Imran,"A very basic room which has just what you need - the main attraction is great location. A good option if you want to save on New York accommodation. Friendly and helpful host. Clean, quiet to sleep. Very good wifi. "
12192,12789337,11/5/14,14198882,Gabriel,"An affordable room, convenient location, mostly a place to sleep at night, take a bath in the morning and prepare your breakfast (but what else do you need if you are visiting NY?) Edward is a nice and easy host who always is ready to solve any of your requiriments."
12192,13066828,19/5/14,3424433,Magnus,"What you see is what you get, small room in basement with no view but you stay here for the location and nothing else. Shared bathroom and kitchen were clean enough and Edward was a very nice and friendly host. Maybe the wall between the two rooms was a bit too thin. Anyway, I wanted a place in the middle of my favourite NYC area where I could sleep and keep my stuff and it's a good and affordable option for a weekend or a couple of days."
12192,13279811,24/5/14,14053118,Nathawut,"Edward is very kind and generous.   The place is so great and convenient to other famous locations.   For me, I love most of the things here.   However, you have to understand this is NYC.   So, if you have enough experience in NYC, you will know that this place is very good.   For me, I visit NYC over 10 times.   Thus, I can tell you from my experience.    "
12192,13456886,27/5/14,15814700,Abigael,"Very accommodating on very short notice (2 days!). Edward was very fast at communication, was flexible with the check-in/check-out. The place was just as described. We were very happy with our first airbnb experience. Thanks!"

12192,14149489,13/6/14,3326456,Alayna,Edward was a lovely host. Very helpful and easy to get hold of. The place was just as described. No nasty surprises. Which is exactly what you want on your holiday. The location was great. Not far from everything. Nice quiet (considering it's in NY) and safe neighbourhood. but it's not a boring neighbourhood. Good eating places right at the front door. Everything went smoothly which I'm so grateful for! Thanks Edward!
12192,14589222,22/6/14,10172465,Michael,Edward was super helpful throughout stay. I really enjoyed the location of the apt and extended my stay for 2 more nights after I got here.
12192,14894790,28/6/14,4060219,Harry,"Edward's room was absolutely perfect for me… the bed was very comfortable, the air conditioning worked like a charm, and it was located in a very trendy part of the East Village. Transportation just a short walk from the apartment, and the price was right for my stay. I'll be looking up Edward again when I need a place to stay."

I like the apartment, the bed, the location, everything. He only let in really nice people as roomates and we had so much fun together. Edward comes every week to make sure its clean, comfortable and we're doing fine. Nothing but amazing. "
12192,17436343,12/8/14,14694863,Lucas,"Great Location, comfort bed, nice kitchen. 

We didn`t had much contact with Edward, but he was receptive on arrival, always helpful and even helped me with my delayed luggage (from the airline company).

Lower East Side is the best place to stay in Manhattan, for sure ! And the aptm is very well located, with a few steps from great restaurants, supermarkets and delis.

The place seems a little bigger in the pictures but and the end, it was really enough to us. Nothing different than what Edward describes here in AirBnB. Good place to stay, clean, and for an affordable price.

Recommend !

12192,18009871,20/8/14,17744212,Eric,"What can I say? Edward was such an amazing host. Very accommodating and easy to talk to. The place that was described is spot on. Great location in the lower east side, close to all public transportation and best of all GREAT FOOD! I would definitely recommend staying at his place if you are looking to explore NYC for the first time or anytime that is. "

12192,19619239,15/9/14,1834364,Melissa,It's a small space but all we really needed for a cheap yet comfortable stay in Manhattan! Clean and priced for a smaller budget we were happy to stay with such a kind and considerate host.
12192,20141892,24/9/14,9785122,Julie,"We stayed here for 7 days and I would describe the place as a dingy basement apartment that is decent for the price you are paying. Unfortunately, the cleanliness of the shower was unsatisfactory. We regularly stay in cheap motels while traveling. We frequently go camping and shower in public gyms/public restrooms, however we have never seen a bathroom like this.  The picture's of the bathroom on airbnb looked much cleaner.

The shower tub and walls contained yellow and orange stains throughout as well as mold. The shower curtain had stains, mildew and was slimy.  The shower head was not working properly. The shower drain was clogged. We also found a couple of cockroaches in the bathroom and our bedroom, but that may be expected in a New York City basement.

Aside from the bathtub, the rest of the apartment was okay and the bed was comfortable. The location was pretty close to public transportation and food. Edward is also very nice and accommodated our crazy check-in/check-out times. He does not live in the apartment, but we didn't have problems reaching him. We would stay here again if the bathroom can be fixed/cleaned.

"
12192,20574354,1/10/14,14524924,Beth,"Basic room in basement apartment in a great location. Room is quiet and bed is comfy. Good base for exploring NYC - close to metro, cafés, bars and shops. 
Great communication with Edward leading up to our arrival and throughout our stay. "
12192,20770642,5/10/14,776685,Kelli,"The place is pretty bare-bones but the location is great and the bedroom is more than adequate. Edward is friendly and hospitable, and very easy to get ahold of. The bathroom left some cleanliness to be desired but it was also very old, so it could just be one of those bathrooms that always looks kind of gross even when it's just been cleaned. Overall, a decent place if you're willing to ""slum it"" a little in exchange for a great and budget-friendly location. "
12192,21215419,13/10/14,20561051,Consuelo,"El apartamento está muy bien situado...y dentro de ella tienes de todo. Cierto es q es un sótano y el patio de acceso no está en buenas condiciones. Pero calidad/precio, es recomendable. Edward es muy amable! :)"
12192,21429825,17/10/14,48002563,Gizelle,"The place is very close to great food places and subways not too far to walk from! My brother and I felt that the simplicity of the room to just sleep in and safely store our belongings was great! The bathroom could use a little fixing up but other than that, our stay was great and Edward is a very friendly host! We tried the burger place and ramen place right next to the appartment and they both were amazing! So awesome that it's right there!"
12192,21750334,23/10/14,6869256,Stephanie,"This apartment was small, but comfortable. NYC is an expensive place to stay and Edward has done a great job of providing comfortable accommodation for those on a budget. Location was fantastic, near plenty of shops and restaurants with a great calm hipster vibe. The apartment itself is small and dark (being a basement apartment), but this is no issue if you are a busy traveller looking to spend your days out and about exploring. Downsides: the apartment was cold at night, quite old and a little dingy. The wifi was not working during our week long stay, despite Edward's efforts to fix this. Edward however was a great host; always contactable and is doing his best to improve the place. He was always friendly and helpful if we had any questions. "
12192,22056148,28/10/14,21639164,Frederik,"Had to book on very short notice (same day booking) but Edward answered right away and he organised everything very fast. He is a great host, you find everything you need in the apartment. Thanks again!"

12192,22674984,11/11/14,23113353,Elvis,"Edward is a great guy and he is an inspiring actor. Which is awesome to meet. His place is cheap and Edward supplies everything! From the room to bath towels. There are also extra shower stuff supplied, but this was my first time using AirBNB, I ended up using my own stuff. Great place. There are plenty of places to eat and drink! You are 10 minute walk away from LES. You are smack in the middle of Alphabet City, and few minutes away from St. Mark's Place. I will highly consider this place for a budget and enjoy the night life."
12192,23693328,8/12/14,14536200,Peter,"I'm very glad I stayed at this place,  had an amazing time here. very good price and the lower East village is a great neighbourhood to stay in, it's close to everything and safe.   The bedroom is big enough for 2 people and the bed is very comfortable and big.  Edward is friendly, helpful and quick to return messages if you need to contact him.  I highly recommend staying at this place.  "
12192,23829992,11/12/14,6527,Ami,"Eric was great communicating with me, and made me feel welcome from the beginning. It is a small and cozy room, and is great for the price - and the central location. This is a great place for someone who spends most of their time out of the apartment!"
12192,24273802,24/12/14,22844662,Emily,Edward was a great host. He was responsive to questions and very helpful in resolving any issues that came up. A friend and I visited for a week from Texas and stayed in one of the three bedrooms. The other two rooms were rented out to 4 others. There is a shared bathroom that is small. The cleanliness was satisfactory but there may have been a cockroach infestation as we saw more roaches than we cared to count in the kitchen area and bathroom.
12192,24923544,4/1/15,22321067,Aimée-Lou,Great room and great price! The location was perfect for us and near lots of cool restaurants and bars. East Village was the perfect spot for our New Years celebrations. Edward was very helpful and answered all of our questions. The room was clean and cosy and the bed was very comfortable.

12192,26248089,8/2/15,24687681,Emilie,"Edward' place is in a great location not far from the metro to reach ""uptown"" and ""downtown"" in a very short time. The apartment, however, is not very quiet, lots of noise from neighbors. But, it is functional and clean, the room is simple but practical. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the value for money. Bedding is very good, and Edward provides towels, shampoo and shower gel, big plus! Thank U !"
12192,27723662,10/3/15,26925727,Veronica,"Todo muy bien! Edward es genial, y se ocupa mucho del departamento! Todo muy limpio siempre, algunas cucas, pero se estaba solucionando. El barrio esta muy bien! Lo recomiendo! Everithing was great! Edward is an amazing host! "
12192,28883253,31/3/15,12144453,Melissa,"Edward was on POINT!  He was very well prepared and gave me a lot of notice on what to do before my trip. He was kind, very personable, and the place was better than what I imagined!  Even though there was one shared bathroom, I honestly had no problem with it at all!  (me and my long showers)  I never notice when the other tenants were using it, and all of our schedules for some reason offset one another because I honestly never even saw the other tenants!  This place is perfect for someone who wants to enjoy the city and rest in the middle of the day because being a tourist can be exhausting.  This place is super close to the subway stop, and it's next to a lot of great VEGAN restaurants as well!  I love the Lower East Side, and I'm definitely going to try to book this place again if it's available the next time I'm in town.  Thank you so much again, Edward!"
12192,31795774,10/5/15,19548669,Firat,"The house is so clean and location is great. You can go everywhere by subway. Edward is a cool guy, he helped me to explore the city and neighborhood also."
12192,32680191,20/5/15,3800757,Niklas,Clean and great room. Edward is an awesome host. Will definitely look up this place again when next time around. Recommended.
12192,32835288,22/5/15,20774880,Lori,"Edward is an EXCELLENT host with fabulous communication skills and prompt replies. He is also willing to work with you to accommodate different arrival times, etc. Most impressive were the many thoughtful touches, such as having a computer and printer available, or providing recommendations for eateries, etc. The space is much larger than it appears in the photos and the bed is fabulously comfortable. Plenty of room to hang your clothing with provided hangars. Hair dryers, shampoo, dishes, too many little comforts were easily accessible. Everything is quite clean, including the bathroom. I would stay here again in an INSTANT and highly recommend it to anyone who wants a centrally located, friendly clean, reasonably priced accommodation to enjoy the fabulous city and feel safe. I always felt safe here. "
12192,33446187,28/5/15,27750715,Alberto,"Hosting more than 300 people means quality: email with all the informations, flexible check in and check out and last but not least Edward helped us to bring our luggages. The house is essential and it has everything. It is located in a great neighborhood with a lot of restaurants, pubs and near the subway. I recommend this place."
12192,34971504,14/6/15,3060725,Andreas,"Boendet hos Edward var bra. Vi hade tillgång till ett sovrum och ett gemensamt kök och badrum som vi delade med ett annat airbnb-rum och Edwards kompis Dennis som bodde där permanent. Lägenheterna ligger i en källare. Ett bra badrum med fräsch toalett och dusch/badkar. Generellt sett var det bra städat och relativt fräscht överallt. Något sämre möjligheter till att laga mat och ha någonstans att äta, då vardagsrummet är väldigt litet och utan matbord.

Läget är perfekt. Nära till allt, både kommunikationer, restauranger och bra områden. 
Jag kan verkligen rekommendera boendet hos Edward. Både Edward och Dennis (som bodde där) var enkla att få tag på och tillmötesgående. Vi kommer att bo där igen nästa gång vi kommer till New York."
12192,36098860,25/6/15,31740769,Matt,Edward is a great host. He communicated clearly and promptly with me. For the price and convenience I have no complaints.
12192,36469248,28/6/15,30382439,Yaoqi,Edward was a very nice host. I met some accidents and talked with Edward. He gave me valuable advice and we figured my problem perfectly. 
12192,37161738,5/7/15,25913550,Shraddha,"The place was comfortable and clean, and the location was amazing, would definitely stay here again"
12192,37819611,10/7/15,6244380,Raymond,"Edward is the most professional airbnb host I've ever met. Not only is his place super clean, he is also very hospitable - he was more than willing to accommodate my requests and gave me some tips on NYC. The location of his place is very central in the east village in a safe and quiet area. I would definitely stay at Edward's again when in New York."
12192,38352214,14/7/15,32772099,James,Nice room in a fantastic location. Edward is very nice and accommodating too. Enjoyed the stay!
12192,41418189,7/8/15,2766080,Edmond,Edward and his rommates Dennis are nice guy.  They are very friendly to talk to.  We even drink together during our conversation.  I strongly recommend other guests to stay with them in the future.
12192,41827344,9/8/15,38722363,Kyra,"I had a great time at Edward's place. The room was clean and cozy and the bed was so comfortable! The location was perfect for what I needed. I didn't meet Edward nor his roommates, but they were easily reachable if I had any concerns. There was a slight snafu with getting the keys: Edward was away on a business trip and his roommate Isai was at work so they left the keys for me at a local coffee shop. However, the wrong name had been given to the people at the shop so when I told them my name, they said there were no keys for me. However, once I managed to get in contact with Isai and got the situation sorted, it was smooth sailing from there. Overall, I had a great experience and if I'm in NYC in the future, will definitely consider staying here again. "
12192,43915690,23/8/15,29878907,Millanne,"The room was quite humid, even with the a/c on and there were a lot of cockroaches mainly in the kitchen but also in the bathroom and room.
We didn't meet Edward, but he checked in on us by messages and had Dennis, who lived in another room in the basement, to help us.
The neighborhood was great and close to everything, but a bit dirty.
We lived there for two weeks and it  was ok, but we will not stay there again mainly because of the cockroaches."
12192,44996285,30/8/15,41698718,Hugo,"Le logement est spacieux, confortable, et l'hôte est à l'écoute, ses instructions sont claires et son tarif raisonnable. Parfait !"
12192,45945467,7/9/15,36730124,Anja,"We weren't impressed. There needed a bit of cleaning and it was in a basement with no opportunity to open a window, but there was air-conditioning."
12192,46493006,11/9/15,3559800,Myriam,"The location is great; close to many restaurants, pubs, entertainment venues,etc... in east village.

The host is very communicative; I haven't met Edward but he was always helpful in his replies to my messages. I was delayed to arrive to New York and check-in was flexible. I've also had a last minute visit from a friend and Edward agreed to let my friend stay with me for one night.

One negative aspect. The flat is in the basement as mentioned in the ad so it is not very pleasant having to walk next to the building waste disposal containers to go in the flat. But the main unpleasant aspect were the cockroaches in the room, kitchen and bathroom. I suggest for the sake of future visitors to make an extra effort to apply additional spray treatment in the flat for pest control.  
"
12192,48757127,28/9/15,4812103,Tanya,"Edward is a nice guy, very ""professional"" with useful guide tips. It's a 3-room flat, 2 for rent, shared kitcken and bathroom. Good for bagpackers if just taking a sleep at night after an exausting trip day in NYC. Superior location in Manhattan, easy access to metro, restaurant and grocery."
12192,49073491,30/9/15,9669234,Andy,"Nice host - good location - reasonably clean accommodations.
The room is in a basement suite in the back of the building, and while the place itself is reasonable, the entrance way is a bit stark.
Still a reasonably good place to stay.
"
12192,50317525,11/10/15,36616125,Shannie,"The room looks exactly like the pictures. The bed is super comfortable and also there's a full length mirror, which I appreciated much so. The bathroom is small, but I did not mind. The location is everything! There are many cafes, bars, and restaurants around the area but what won me over was the people. Everyone I have encountered in the neighborhood was really kind. Edward is very friendly and nice. If I'm ever in New York again, I would stay at Edward's place again.  "
12192,50609449,12/10/15,43149225,Manya,"Edward is great. He was super helpful and quick at responding, only tries to accommodate. The apartment is clean and well located although a bit of a hike to the subway but manageable. All in all a good experience and would recommend to anyone :)"

12192,52247246,27/10/15,44362375,Alexis,"I had a great stay here . It's really the little things that make a difference . For example : the bed was super comfy , sheet where clean , bathroom was clean. Also my host was very helpful . I would forsure like to stay here . It's in an excellent area and the the apartment was very quiet so I slept well. Also there is the best Ramen place ever right next store called "" Mica "" "
12192,53112847,5/11/15,28992056,Damian,"Edward is a very good host. If you want to stay in Manhattan for a great price and don't know anywhere to stay or can't afford a fancy hotel. Edward has the place for you! It is easy to get to, it has a clean shared bathroom, a lockable too
, but you rarely see the other people. I'd stay there again!"
12192,53616520,10/11/15,45105526,Alizée,"Edward was a wonderful host. We had some problems at the airport and it took us longer than expected to arrive at his place. Despite this late arrival, Edward was very cool, he waited for us, gave us a tour and some tips about the city. 
The apartment was neat and came regularly to clean during our stay.
The location was very convenient, close to all touristic places. The flat is provided with everything you need (wifi; computer; printer; towels ...)  
We had a pleasant stay, it was our first time in New York and we will definitely go back this amazing city. "
12192,54265666,17/11/15,18370776,Bastian,"Edwards Apartment ist ein sehr guter Ausgangspunkt Alphabet City / das East Village zu erkunden. Das Bett ist wunderbar und Edward ein sehr guter Gastgeber. Die Küche habe ich nicht benutzt, im Kühlschrank ist eine Menge Platz. Wi-Fi und gemeinsamer Computer waren ein Top!"
12192,55379307,1/12/15,45332096,Tyler,"We stayed at Edward's place over thanksgiving weekend, and it was a great stay. Edward was out of town the day we arrived but arranged for the super to give us our keys when we arrived. Also, he was almost always available if we had any questions. The place is small but well furnished, and kept very clean. There are two rooms right next to each other, both of which he rents out; our co-guests were very nice! My only (minor) complaint is that there are very few windows in the whole place, which can make it feel very small. Lastly, the location is pretty good; tons of restaurants and bars nearby, if you are into eating and drinking and that kind of thing."
12192,59119805,7/1/16,40762807,Caroline,Great room with a good location. Edward was so nice and helpful! We would definitely recommend Edward and his room. 
12192,59862557,16/1/16,8131965,Tina,"I was staying at Edward place only few days and then left. I can't say bad about him as we never met, but one think, for to enter into apartments you have to walk through the trash and inside of apt there is some cockroaches."
12192,64920322,9/3/16,58485613,Stephanie,"I had an absolute wonderful time staying at Edward's East Village apartment. The room was exactly like pictured. There was fresh linen, towels, hairdryer, shampoo etc. provided. And wifi! Everything was nice and Edward was the perfect host and super easy to get in touch with. Waiting keys in hand as I arrived. The area was perfect, and the street provided easy access to great restaurants, bars and grocery shopping. Would definitely recommend this to friends, and would love to stay again. Thumbs up!"
12192,65910776,17/3/16,56801537,Mike,"I stayed just the one night at Edwards Airbnb and found him a very helpful and gracious host.
He had a wealth of information about the New York and pointed me in the right direction for the best Theatre shows and where to buy the best tickets online.
All together I enjoyed my brief stay."
12192,66591283,23/3/16,121337,Nav,"Edwin was very proactive in his communications and made every effort to meet with us to welcome us (unfortunately we couldnt meet as we were running late in our arrival). Nevertheless, he found a way to get us the keys.

The room was of a perfect size - not too small, but not very large either. The apartment came with the basic amenities and was not very difficult to reach (considering some other apartments were 5 floors up a walk-up) and the neighbourhood was good as well. 

Highly recommended."
12192,68168211,2/4/16,8550243,Mounia,"We had a great time at Edwards accommodation. We stayed 10 days there. He is a great host! He was perfectly prepared to host us. Edward gave us tons of helpful informations already before arriving. Though he wasn't living in the apartment he was always available and helped us if needed. The place is great located, close to many restaurants and bars and a subway close by. You get what you see, which is exactly what we needed for your stay in NYC incl. a TV with Netflix. Great stay! Many thanks to Edward! We would definitely recommend this place."
12192,69004416,8/4/16,59220694,Christine,"Edward was a great host, very thoughtful and provided what we needed for our stay.  The room and bed were comfortable and the kitchen adequate.  Even though it was small, nobody seemed to get in each other's way and everyone was friendly and helpful."
12192,70113644,16/4/16,64375748,Paul,"This is a nice spot in the East Village, prime location, great value. It's east of the high traffic areas of 1st ave, so very quiet at night and in the morning. Plenty of everything very close by. 

Edward and the building super Dennis couldn't have been more on top of things. No hitches, very communicative, reached out to me more than once to make sure everything was alright.

The place was super clean, which I appreciated. It's a downstairs apt, and you have to walk through a dumpster area to get to the place which wasn't really made clear. It's a minor setback especially given the price. 

All in all it was a great experience. I'd definitely go back."
12192,72455758,2/5/16,29354215,Simon,"Edward was a fantastic host who was always accessible to contact, gave great recommendations for local spots to check out.  The listing itself was perfect for my stay in East Village - a great central location for a lot of cafés, bars and restaurants, and very close to both train and bus to explore.  It also affords a good level of privacy if required and a nice shared space to meet your fellow travellers."
12192,73475001,8/5/16,7568802,Michael,"On short notice Edward welcomed me to his great BnB.  Perfect East Village location.  Nearby great restaurants, bars, coffee shops."
12192,74263753,14/5/16,34225102,Benjamin,Wow this was an awesome experience.  I am really happy that we managed to find this little gem of an apartment. The location was great and so was the description.  This place is really good quality for the price. 
12192,75850664,23/5/16,36859551,Cécile,"Very pleasant stay at Edward's place! 
Edward was there when we arrived and gave us lots of tips about the neighbourhood. He did not stay in the apartment but he made sure to ask if we needed anything. 
The place is clean, you have to share the bathroom and the kitchen.   The room is kind of small, so is the bathroom, but for the price and the great location in East village you can't complain! 
In definitive, I recommend it for anyone travelling on budget and seeking a nice affordable place to stay in Manhattan, close to everything (10 minutes walk to F metro) "
12192,79262490,12/6/16,45053522,Lise,"Nice stay in Edward's house ! Very good location in NYC. He was very accommodating with us : we could drop our luggage the morning...

Only the path to the basement was little smelly. Although I never met Edward, I received all assistance from his roommate. Thank you for hosting me."
12192,88730743,25/7/16,283907,Melissa,"Really enjoyed my stay here! It was in a convenient location, well equipped with everything you need and very clean. Edward was super quick with responding to messages and was very welcoming and gave some great advice upon check-in. 

Thanks for having me!"
12192,90655091,1/8/16,76602792,Claire,"Awesome location in the East Village and a great host! Edward was super about communicating about the room and arrival details, plus he kept in touch throughout the week to check that everything was going well. He was helpful as well, making sure I knew how to get around the city and lending me an umbrella when it rained. The room was comfortable, with room for my suitcase and carry-on, plus a desk and shelves. Photos in the listing were very accurate. Because the apartment is in the basement, when it got really hot outside (over 90 F), the common area did kind of have that New York smell, but the air in the room was always fresh, plus the AC made it very comfortable. It's several blocks' walk to the subway (F line), but there are actually a ton of restaurants, shops, and a grocery store within a block or two, plus plenty of nightlife, so you don't really need to go far if you don't want to. Even so, because the apartment doesn't face the street (and it's a quiet side street), there were no issues at all with noise. I was there a week and didn't spend too much time in the apartment, mostly using it as a home base for coming and going, but I had a great trip, and I'd definitely stay there again!"
12192,95497872,20/8/16,78451737,Stefano,"We did not meet Edward but he did everything to allow us a good stay. The Room was fine and effective. East Village is the best neiborhood, full of different Street foods and clubs. "
12192,100972948,11/9/16,78687002,Felicia,"Friendly host at a decent location in Manhattan. Walking distance to three different subway lines. Edward was very flexible with our check-in and check-out times, and he was helpful in recommending places to eat and how to get around the area. He checked in with us mid-stay to see if we needed anything and had taken care of it by the time we got back that night."
12192,102362695,17/9/16,91893996,芊妤,Edward is really nice! He provided warm hospitality to us and told us a lot of great places nearby. The room is just like the photos. It's not so big but with everything you need!

La habitación era cómoda, falla que no tenga ventanas. El cuarto de baño estaba limpio aunque era pequeño y a veces resulta un poco incómodo. El anfitrión estuvo en todo momento disponible y atento. Muy recomendable. "

12192,108545023,16/10/16,67846787,Alvin,"I never got the chance to meet Edward personally, but nevertheless, he was very helpful, accommodating and responsive prior to and throughout my stay. I did link up with his roommate, Dennis, who was also very helpful and welcoming to me. The neighborhood is very pleasant and there was no concern with any noise, so I definitely had a good night's rest. I highly recommend this place to anyone and I'd definitely come back here again whenever I visit NYC again."

It is close to restaurants & bars as well as the bus line which really takes you anywhere but also to the next train station. It's held clean & the bed is comfortable. I did not spend so much time in the apt. since I came to explore the city. I couldn't meet Edward in person but he was always available & thankfully very easygoing with my checking in & out ~ Thank you very much!"

There is all you need, from USB chargers to fast WiFi connection to hot shower - just no windows as it's a basement apartment.
There is always another guest in the adjacent room, so you may mingle with fellow travelers, but don't worry - your room comes with a lock and key.
Edward is a very hospitable person with excellent communication who can make you feel welcome in an instant.
The location is good with a 5-10 minute walk to the nearest Subway, offering quick and easy access to Lower or Upper Manhattan."

The room is exactly as described and perfect for a light traveler looking for a spot to chill for the night.

12192,268001525,23/5/18,44874117,Mark,"What a unique find! Location is incredible. Efficient use of space and included amenities. Funky cool. 

This is a basement apartment and has a shared bath with other guests. Cleanliness was an issue for me with the other guest not having the same habits as mine, but I was able keep things clean myself. 

Kitchen has everything, gas stove, large fridge, mini fridge in room. In my room bed took up most of the room, but also included a Roku TV with access to Netflix. Desk, place to hang clothes, side table if needed, coat hooks, lots of built in shelf storage.  So well laid out. 

If you are traveling alone and want an inexpensive place that’s centrally locates in the East Village... Edward is delightful  and his place is a true find!

I’ll be back!!"
12192,272582119,3/6/18,5355513,Shelby,The place was perfect for our short weekend in the city. We arrived much later than expected and Edward happily greeted us with no issue.

12192,274558266,9/6/18,100855,Meera,Edward's place was the best. It is a simple place to sleep while I spent my days running around the city for interviews and for some sightseeing. It was also very clean. Highly recommended.
12192,277068438,15/6/18,133989440,John,"It's good value and 30 min away from most of the famous spots. The neighborhood restaurants closes around 11, so late night offerings are limited during weekdays. Overall if you don't mind old apartments it's a good choice."

バス、地下鉄に慣れればマンハッタンならどこでも一時間位でいけるので、苦になりません。

但し地下の部屋なので、若干虫などが、、、全然許容範囲ですが！

Edward was an amazing host, quick responses to all my annoying questions and made the check in and check out experience SO smooth and was super flexible where possible. I have nothing negative to say about this place and would def return!"
12299,76274099,26/5/16,18692681,María Inés,"Abdul's apartment is just perfect!! An   Ideal place to live during your trip. Great location, just 2 or 3 blocks from the subway to Manhattan and williamsburg. Really quiet and safe environment with a lot of nice coffees, restaurants, bars and young people. Abdul is a great host, he answer all of our questions and recommended fun things to do. We will definitly return to Abdul's place. Thank you for the perfect trip!!!"
12299,90581708,1/8/16,46002602,Niamh,"I had an amazing experience at Abdul's wonderful apartment . I can only describe it as a five star experience. Abdul is an excellent friendly and accommodating host and was very helpful with information and advice . The apartment is delightful , stylish & comfortable in a superb location . I will definitely return on future visits and highly recommend to anyone heading to New York , Brooklyn has so much to offer and Abdul's apartment is close to the subway for exploring . There are numerous excellent restaurants and bars less than a stone's throw from the property. An unbeatable location in the nicest part of Brooklyn close to the park also. "
12299,97468099,27/8/16,23245513,Randy,"Abdul was very communicative leading up to our trip, answering emails and texts whenever we had questions. He met us upon arrival and even helped us with our luggage. Throughout our stay he remained in touch and even emptied the trash for us. He was very gracious and accommodating, we really enjoyed staying at his clean and spacious apartment, located in a lovely convenient neighborhood with many nice shops nearby. Thank you for making our NY trip such a pleasant one, Abdul!"
12299,195209158,18/9/17,124577324,Mark,"This was exactly what we hoped for. The area is family friendly, mostly residential, with good restaurants and coffee shops nearby. Being one block away from Prospect Park is great. Highly recommended. Abdul has a wonderful and convenient apartment."

12303,116018,11/10/10,216566,Paola,La casa di Yolande è molto piacevole e confortevole. Lei è una persona estramamente disceta e rispettosa dela privacy. Il mio soggiorno come ospite è stato ottimo.
12303,127596,26/10/10,237588,Gennaro,Bellissima esperienza casa stupenda e pulita 
12303,138125,13/11/10,257108,Mark,Very obliging host and a great place to stay - apartment and location.
12303,170075,13/1/11,210305,Julie,"I absolutely loved Yolande's apartment and the neighborhood. The apartment is spacious, clean and beautiful. The room and bathroom are very comfortable. The neighborhood - Fort Greene - is my new favorite in New York. Full of restaurants, shops (quite a few organic supermarkets!), brownstones, parks and well connected to Manhattan. Yolande is a wonderful host, her presence being both comforting and discreet. Her great taste makes this apartment very suited for architecture and design lovers. I highly recommend it!"
12303,552135,20/9/11,189791,Nick,"Perfect host, perfect place to call home whilst in Brooklyn. Yolande is one of those people you feel like you've met before. She has created a beautiful home, I really enjoyed my stay. Fort Greene is a great neighbourhood, with an abundance of cool cafe's, bars and restaurants. I highly recommend booking Yolande's place if you have the opportunity.  "
12303,593657,3/10/11,1137303,David,"Wonderful place in a great part of Fort Greene. Yolande is a very gracious host and her skill as a stylist is present in the aesthetic and atmosphere of the apartment, with every square inch thoughtfully furnished. Our paths rarely crossed as we were both out much of the time, but she was very helpful when I asked for information. Would highly recommend her apartment to those heading to NYC. "
12303,655582,23/10/11,351297,Meg,"Yolande's place was gorgeous, clean, and quiet! Located in a gorgeous building and an amazing neighborhood. I was in town for work and barely at the apartment, so I never actually encountered Yolande (how crazy!)...but she kept the place incredibly tidy and was welcoming from the start."
12303,713817,13/11/11,1265975,Armelle,"GREAT apartment and uber stylish as is lovely Yolanda, a fabulous host.  Huge light filled room with 2 cupboards and a desk, perfect for laptop if you happen to be working... Private bathroom a bonus, close to great restaurants, bars, cafes, subway in tree lined streets of Fort Green. Super easy access to Manhattan by subway, Highly recommend!!"
12303,4158612,15/4/13,4672405,Kathrin,"Yolande’s more than beautiful and tidy apartment is in a very pleasant, save and quiet neighborhood in Brooklyn/Fort Green – Manhattan can easily be reached by Metro. We (the hirable room is big enough for 2) actually didn’t meet that often during our stay, but she ever was an amiable and helpful host. We would highly recommend her place!"
12303,4624122,16/5/13,5451059,Rud,"Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt! Yolande haben wir nur zweimal kurz gesehen, sie ist aber sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit und antwortete sehr schnell auf Anfragen. Die Wohnung ist geschmackvoll eingerichtet, sehr hell und sauber. Die Schlüsselübergabe verlief unkompliziert über Portier. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr entspannt, nett und sicher."
12303,4788329,26/5/13,2239439,Louris,"Yolande's apartment is absolutely fantastic. Everything is beautifully decorated and very clean. The bed was comfortable, lots of space in the room, and you get your own bathroom. Yolande was very friendly and helpful. She had lots of great tips for things to do around the area and was willing to help out in any way. The apartment building itself is very nice, in a good area, with a doorman and an elevator (!). There are lots of shops nearby - supermarkets, dining options etc. It is close to BAM (Brooklyn Academy of Music) which has lots of great shows, and also close to the flea market on Saturdays. My favourite cafe was Smooch (suggested by Yolande) and The General Greene for salted caramel ice cream. There are a few subway stations in the area servicing different lines - all about a ten or fifteen minute walk. A cab into Lower Manhattan cost me about $15. I would definitely stay here again. I was sad to leave."
12303,7970120,10/10/13,491624,Laurel,"Yolande's apartment is gorgeous, spotlessly clean and extremely comfortable. In a fantastic neighborhood. Yolande herself is kind and lovely and welcoming. I can't say enough good things about her or her place. This was a fantastic experience."
12303,13577732,31/5/14,14803492,Marjolijn,"Yolande has got a really nice appartment in a very safe and beautiful neighborhood with a lot of brownstones and some nice shops and restaurants. Although a trip to Manhattan takes some time (it is not very close to the subway stations), it is always a pleasure to return to this area.

Yolande was out or in her own room a lot and gives you enough privacy, but she is open to have a chat and give advice or help you out. This was very nice and helpful! You can use the kitchen and living room. The mattress is really good.

Note that the bathroom is yours but not accessible from within your room, just two steps from the room though. Overall, we had a great stay and would definitely recommend it."
12303,15822611,16/7/14,2509330,Jonathan,Everything was perfect. The room and bathroom were exceptionally clean and comfortable and the neighborhood was beautiful and charming. Fort Greene is an excellent place to stay - close to the pharmacy and numerous shops and restaurants; only a short commute to Manhattan. Loved staying here.
12303,19263812,9/9/14,14395525,Michi,"Yolande's apartment is incredible, she has great taste and has made her home insanely comfortable and stylish. Its a great NYC experience. The room is large as is the bathroom and impeccably clean. Yolande interacts with you as much as you like and makes you feel comfortable to do your own thing while you are staying at her place.

Fort Greene is also a wonderful, leafy, quiet neighbourhood, Its great to come home after a day in Manhattan to somewhere a little more quiet, especially if you are staying in NYC for a while. Having said that, it's still is a vibrant area and theres lot of great restaurants, bars and cafes in the area. 

In my case, I relocated to NYC for grad school and stayed with Yolande for a month. I felt very at ease, I was studying/working a lot and she was happy for me to do that from her place. We got along very well and I see Yolande as a new friend in New York that I will continue to stay in touch with. I highly recommend staying with Yolande, she's is a wonderful host. "
12303,20660987,3/10/14,12489732,Dorothé,"Ons verblijf bij Yolande is geweldig goed bevallen. Het appartement is ruim, sfeervol en authentiek wat maakte dat wij ons er direct prettig voelden. Het was iedere dag weer het gevoel van thuis komen. Ook de omgeving droeg daartoe bij.  Het appartement is gelegen in een hippe, groene wijk met direct om de hoek een hele reeks leuke restaurantjes. 's Nachts is het er heerlijk rustig waardoor we sliepen als roosjes.
We hebben Yolande maar weinig gesproken doordat wij zelf de hele dag op pad waren en doordat het appartement zo is ingedeeld dat zij vooral in haar eigen privé ruimte verbleef. Wellicht hadden wij het wel leuk gevonden om iets meer contact te hebben en haar bijzondere tips te benutten. Maar als we elkaar spraken was ze altijd behulpzaam en vriendelijk. 

"
12303,24938771,4/1/15,13272489,New,"FABULOUS apartment; clean, warm, beautifully decorated. The photos don't do it justice. Kitchen and bathroom are great, bed is comfy. Yolande is easy going and friendly - you'll enjoy her relaxed hosting. The only downside is the distance from a subway station (door to door it was about 45 minutes into Manhattan) but in the summer it would be a nice walk. Groceries, fantastic bars, parks and cafés are all very close! Thank you Yolande. We'll recommend you to family and friends!!! "

The apartment is in a very nice area of Brooklyn and in a safe building with doorman. Yolande is an artist so her apartment has a very good taste. It has a lot of light and is very spacious. My bedroom was amazing: bright, clean, plenty of space and the washroom is private. Which to me makes a lot of difference. Yolande is a lovely person: sweet, private and respectful. I will come back! "
12303,58539685,3/1/16,15734859,Valerio,"Abbiamo soggiornato per una settimana nel bellissimo appartamento di Yolande ed è stata un'esperienza perfetta!
La stanza è curatissima e molto accogliente, proprio come nelle fotografie, e Yolande è sempre stata molto disponibile nel dare suggerimenti ed informazioni su qualunque cosa. La casa si trova a 10 minuti a piedi dalla metropolitana più vicina da cui poi si raggiunge velocemente Manhattan. Il quartiere in cui si trova è molto tranquillo e sicuro, con numerosi bar e ristoranti ad un paio di isolati di distanza.
Se siete diretti a New York questa è una bellissima opportunità per godere anche del quartiere di Brooklyn. 
Consigliato!!"

Thanks Yolande!"
12303,114356211,17/11/16,81351,Vor,"I really enjoyed my time at Yolandes place! She created a relaxed and easy going atmosphere. The apartment was clean, Yolande gave me a chip card for the laundry room and I could use her kitchen when I felt like cooking something, from time to time :) I highly recommend her as a host and I'll definitely text her next time I'm in town."
12318,19596,7/12/09,37758,Dianne,"cynthia is one of the most reliable host in airbnb. i had a bad experience with host Anya Babbit( who advertised a beautiful apt n accepted our booking but cancelled 3 days before my arrival in NY)i was terribly stressed and would have been left terribly stranded with my daughter in NY if not for Cynthia who responded quickly to our email and reservation and arrange for taxi service as well at the airport. 

very helpful and nice person...will not hesitate to rec her to anyone looking for a place to stay in NY..."
12318,23190,4/1/10,62275,Evelyn,"Great place conveniently located next to subway, restaurants, and bars. Thank you Cynthia for all your help and I hope to see you in the near future. Cheers"
12318,29998,18/3/10,48820,James,"A great experience living the life of a true New Yorker for a week with Cynthia as guide.  The West Side retreat was a wonderful location, near subway, bus, and museums.  Room with bath was fine if a bit short of drawer space.  The setting was quiet and well appointed."
12318,31282,25/3/10,81124,David,My stay was delightful. Cynthia met me at the appointed time and showed me the lay out. Cynthia is an interesting and out going person. The apartment in a classic nyc . It had high ceiling and had all the needed comforts. It was great to be a few steps from Riverside Drive Park and just two blocks from the subway. Everything was clean and thoughtfully done. I will sray there again by choice
12318,37028,21/4/10,96485,Tom,"Our stay in Cynthia's WEST SIDE RETREAT was a wonderful NYC experience.  The  Upper West Side apartment is beautiful, a work of Art Deco splendor.  Close to subway and busses and lots of restaurants in all price ranges.

Our hostess in the apartment was gracious and accomodating, sharing a treasure trove of ideas and experiences.  And Cynthia herself could not have been more helpful in establishing us in her friend's place as well as being at our beck and call and making us feel very secure in the Big Apple.

We would definitely return to this UWS fabulous abode.  My wife's dream-- after living in NYC almost fifty years ago-- was to live in one of the apartments in the 80's near West End and Riverside Drive, with a door-man and an elevator no less!  Thanks for making that dream come true for four days!"
12318,38196,26/4/10,100362,Randy,"I stayed at the spot off 86th.  Awesome location -just 2 blocks away from the subway station and walking distance from many places to eat, shop, and sightsee.  The bedroom was super spacious and it was definitely nice to have my own bathroom.  Ronette and Cynthia  were extremely nice and made me feel welcome during my stay.  I'd definitely consider staying there again.   "
12318,40968,9/5/10,47834,Elvira,"We had a very good time at the West Side Retreat. It's a great location, & we loved the host's balance between recommending, treating us & letting us have our own experience. Now we know what it's like to live on the Upper West Side. Thank you for being the perfect host, all those ten days!"
12318,43482,17/5/10,85834,Terry,"I stayed at the West Side Retreat, and this was my best Airbnb stay yet.  The room and private bath off West 86th Street felt like a penthouse to me. I've never lived in a building with a doorman, and both of the doormen are so sweet and helpful.  The private room is double the size of any hotel room I've ever booked in New York, and the bath is also spacious.  The bed was comfy and there is a rack with hangars so you can easily hang up several outfits.  One reason I have to go back will be to check out Riverside Park because this trip I was focused on activities in Central Park (a bus or subway ride away unless you have time to walk it).  The location is just about a block from a bus stop and two blocks from a subway station.
Riverside Park looked lovely from a block away and everyone tells me that it is a wonderful green treasure in NYC.  This was the first time I've stayed in New York and felt like I could live there.  For the most part, it was like having my own apartment.  The only possible improvement would be a short guide to the neighborhood with Ronette or Cynthia's favorite places for coffee or a light bite.  Since I had my iPhone and Yelp at hand, however, I was fine without it.  Ronette does supply a Zagat guide, but I always prefer first hand recommendations.

I had the opportunity to see Cynthia's place on 97th St. and it truly is a work of art.  If you don't mind sharing a bath and want to lodge in an evolving living space that celebrates creativity, the 97th St. spot would be my recommendation.  For me, I loved all the space I had at the West Side Retreat."
12318,45604,24/5/10,45689,Charla,"A home away from home at West Side Retreat!  Thank you so much to Ronnette and Cynthia for your hospitality and being there for us and taking care of booking a car for us to the airport at 5am!  The bedroom is very spacious and comfortable and it was great having our own bathroom.  We hope that the apartment will be available for our next visit to NYC as it is just perfect for our needs.  Thanks also to Cynthia for inviting us to dinner with your friends.  It was great fun!  Thankyou both for making us so welcome.

12318,53690,16/6/10,127057,Michele,
12318,58940,29/6/10,136077,Karl,"     Cynthia was abroad during my stay, so Ronnette did the honors. She's a delightful conversationalist, and we shared our love of architecture (she's a pro; I'm a fan). It did mean fixing your own breakfast with the available fixin's.
     The place is a gem, built in 1909 when they knew how to build luxury apartments (condos came later): big rooms, high ceilings, hardwood trimmings, etc. Ronnette is spearheading modernization, starting with a zippy elevator; she's leaving the marble foyer in all its old glory. Fortunately utilities are up to contemporary standards. (I've owned and upgraded a San Francisco victorian, so I know the pitfalls.)
     Can't beat the price, location, privacy, ambience and hostess. Highly recommended!
     Karl"
12318,60148,3/7/10,77477,Mike,I booked the West Side Retreat for an initial 3 days and ended up staying for two weeks. Top-notch accommodation with the most gracious host I've ever met during my travels. My new favorite spot in town.

Ronnette's apartment is a purist's art deco delight. The location is wonderful..just a walk across Central Park to Museum Mile, the room is large, extremely comfortable and has everything you need; having your own bathroom and use of the kitchen is a plus. Morning conversations with Ronnette were always interesting; she was extremely helpful and provided insights into many aspects of New York. I appreciated the opportunity to stay here and would highly recommend it. Thank you so much Ronnette and Cynthia."

The location was EXCELLENT, facilities in the apartment were like a home from home, it was like staying with FAMILY in New York!  I hate cities, but New York was made truly magical by the comfort and true feeling of security not to mention the fantastic address that the West Side Retreat offered.  Thanks so much for all your kindness, consideration and hospitality during our stay - please do not hesitate to send any queries from future potential guests to us, we will have NO PROBLEM highly recommending you!!

12318,565666,25/9/11,1015789,Edwin M. And Regina Lynn,"Our trip to New York was more about finding a location that was near our son who lives on West 69th than it was about amenities so the location on West 86th was fine.  

We were only concerned about having a clean bed and bathroom since most of our time would be spent with him outside of these accommodations.  It met those requirements.

I guess we thought the room and bath were a separate entity but it is actually a room and bath that is within the apartment of the owner.  It was like having a separate entity since we very rarely saw the owner.

You can have access to the owner's kitchen  and living room if so desired and there is a coin-operated laundry in the basement.

The owner was very accommodating and went out of her way to get us information on theater tickets."

"" Un séjour dans le merveilleux appartement de Ronette et Cynthia vous fera encore mieux apprécier le temps que vous passerez à New York. Nous y étions comme chez nous, avec une propriétaire passionnante et chaleureuse, au milieu du charme et du confort de son installation et dans le plus joli quartier de New york. Allez-y, les yeux fermés, vous ne le regretterez pas."
12318,714045,13/11/11,124454,Lucy,"West Side Retreat is aptly named. A convenient and quiet location with a very congenial, interesting host. This is an excellent option for a stay in New York, based in the heart of the wonderful Upper West Side with easy access to all New York's attractions. Highly recommend!  "
12318,752945,29/11/11,1223346,Lisa,"we had a great stay at the west side retreat. the apartment is spacious by nyc standards and the location is ideal with good food, the subway and riverside park all within a couple of blocks. we would definitely go back.
thanks - "
12318,1079825,3/4/12,1981034,Bobbie,"I had a fantastic stay with Roni and Cynthia was so helpful and clear in helping me navigate from the airport to the Upper West Side. The home was clean, charming and located in a very safe neighborhood with easy access to the subway and tasty restaurants. I felt totally comfortable coming and going throughout the day. Would definitely stay here again and will recommend this place to my friends. Thank you for the bath salts for my bath...all that walking took a toll on my toes./ Bobbie"
12318,1261624,11/5/12,882696,Kim,"This is in a great area of New York – far from the zaniness of Times Square; but a 15 minute ride by subway ride gets you there if you want the theatre... You are about a 5 minute walk to the subway from the West Side Retreat. There are plentiful restaurants of all types near-by. Central Park is 10 minutes away. And do visit Riverside Park, it’s just down the block and a beautiful park to relax in.

West Side is great for one or two people – the bed is a double bed. It’s very quiet. There’s plenty of room in addition to your own bedroom – you can use there living room and there is a kitchen (but I hardly used it). You have your own bathroom as well.
"
12318,2075475,23/8/12,40390454,Leena,"Ronnette was really helpful. She made my stay extremely comfortable in her lovely home. The apartment is conveniently located close to the subway with lots of good restaurants and convenience stores nearby. Would recommend Roni's place to anyone wanting to stay in Manhattan. Thanks Roni for the grand tour of your office with the wonderful views. Hope to see you soon either in NYC or in Delhi :-). Thanks Cynthia for connecting me and Ronnette and also for all the helpful info you sent via email. Hope to meet you the next time I am in NYC (hope you had a great time in Italy). 
"
12318,2264718,11/9/12,2989927,Mark,"This is a wonderful location.  A very quiet residence with a large comfortable bedroom and private bathroom just outside the bedroom.  Very clean and well equipped.  i loved the security of having a doorman and well secured doors to the apartment.

The kitchen is perfectly equipped.

The host is available for questions and otherwise you have your privacy.  I highly recommend this lovely place."
12318,4610880,15/5/13,2368180,Michael,"This is a GREAT place to stay. It's on the Upper West Side. It's a only a few minutes to the subway. There are plentiful and various restaurants nearby. It's a  15 minute walk to Central Park (a New York must see). Also well worth a visit, is peaceful Riverside Park just down the street.

The West Side Retreat is my number 1 choice when visiting New York! It's a quiet and a wonderful location. It meets all my requirements. Everything is nearby!

Cynthia keeps guests well informed and answers any questions promptly (not that I had many)."
12318,4819535,27/5/13,6436271,Michele,"This was my first time using this service and I was rather nervous to be honest however Cynthia was fantastic. She replied to my emails in a timely manner, everything was how she explained it would be. The room was clean, comfortable, very spacious and I will most certainly be staying there on my future trips. I highly recommend this choice. The perfect location too. "
12318,5099990,12/6/13,5140586,Jeff,"A great place to stay.  A lovely large room fronting the street, with glimpses of the Hudson and Riverside Park, and an adjoining private bathroom.  Ronnette’s apartment is charming, and in a lovely building.  The location is great and you can very quickly get around NY, with the subway only a two minute walk along the street, and buses around the corner.  The area has an abundance of great cafes/restaurants/delis etc, particularly around the corner on Broadway and Amsterdam.   Although I was visiting as a tourist, I liked the area because it is not a tourist district.
Cynthia was a delight to deal with when arranging my stay.  Ronnette is a great host, but unfortunately our paths hardly crossed, as we were both coming and going. She is very interesting, and I would have liked to get to know her more.
I would definitely like to return.
"
12318,5720182,13/7/13,7174206,Edward,"Very clean room. Private bath.  Never met Ronnette.  Class ""A"" prewar condo.  She worked late every night.  Only criticism I have is the room is cluttered with knick knacks and there is no unused closet or dresser space so I had to keep my things in the suitcase."
12318,6314413,7/8/13,797973,Russell,"Cynthia and her sister Ronnette are very gracious hosts. Cynthia was in Italy and called me personaly to make sure that I was going to get settled in without any problems. I never saw Ronnette ( like having a live-in ghost who made sure I was always comfortable). She even left NyQuil our for me when I was coughing one night from my asthma. I was so gald she din't throw me out thinking I had the plague. Also she let me store my bags till after check out on Tuesday so that I could do all the paperwork on my new appartment. before I left that afternoon. The digs are great and they opened up some closet space. It right on Riverside Park just minutes to the subway. Very safe, has a doorman. 
If there is better you will not find it.

12318,7206374,10/9/13,8324462,Iynna,"Ronnette's place is a real ""haven of rest"" and close to all NY's facilities explorers may
need (bus, subway, shops, restaurants, bars). 
Besides across the street past Riverside Park and 4 blocks away there is the STUNNING Central Park.
The room is clean and very
comfortable. Ronnette is a nice and friendly host and Cynthia was really
efficient to organize my arrival. Thanks all of you for making my first stay in
NY so pleasant.
Thank you Roni for your kind message. Don't worry I will be back in NY and we will see each other soon !

12318,7339893,16/9/13,8056715,Brian,"Had a great time at Ronnette's place. Cynthia responded quickly to my inquiries even though she was out of the country! The apartment exudes old world charm, filled with many decorative arts and art work. The bed was very comfortable, and the kitchen well equipped and modern. A nice feature is that guests have their own bathroom adjacent to bedroom. There's also cable TV in the bedroom. Ronnette is a very engaging, amenable host, but works long hours, so you often have the place to yourself. Conveniently located near 86th St Subway stop and only a few blocks from Zabar's deli."
12318,8250830,22/10/13,8065976,Chantal,"This was my first experience with airbnb and I was lucky. The apartment is beautiful. It is also very clean. The location in the Upper West Side is my favorite in NYC. The presence of a doorman makes it feel safe. Ronnette is very busy and you will not see her much. But if you do, she is smart and fun. Cynthia was very patient with all my requests of informations and quickly available to respond to each of them. It is a friendly place."
12318,8638771,10/11/13,1214008,Marta,"I had a guest who visited New York this past week.  He was hosted by Cynthia.  My guest was very pleased.  The room was very clean, attractively decorated and comfortable.  The private bathroom was nicely appointed.  He received sufficient towels and soap products during his stay.  He was also pleased with the location of the apartment and its proximity to public transportation.  My guest enjoys attending concerts and  opera at Lincoln Center which was easily accessible from the apartment.  This is the first time I use airbnb and was extremely pleased with the experience.  I would certainly hope to be able to have access to this  apartment when other guests visit me in NYC."
12318,8928784,26/11/13,7929863,Douglas,"The accommodations were very much as represented and
very satisfactory. The bed was comfortable, the temperature
agreeable and the kitchen was very good. The neighborhood is
wonderful with subway and buses close by, all kinds of stores and the most luxurious movie theatre in New York with business class
like reclining seats, 3D and bookable seats (AMC 8th and B'way). We would definitely stay there again. The apartment is crowed with
things, especially china and stacks of newspapers but they do not
interfere with our activities. "
12318,9671117,5/1/14,6783825,Ronni,"Being a native New Yorker, my one desire was to be able to experience living on the Upper Westside. Well  fortunately my first experience was at this wonderful apartment where I felt most welcomed. The accommodations were perfect. The room and private (Website hidden by Airbnb) could not ask for more. The location was great. The subway was 2 blocks away. Access to shopping was right around the corner. The hostess was welcoming and available. Thank you."
12318,67736694,31/3/16,6601576,David,"First off, it's a pretty large bedroom and the picture doesn't do it justice. The apartment is lovely with all sorts of art and artifacts. And the kitchen was perfect for my purposes.
The host was very accommodating and easy to contact.
The location is great: just yards away from the park on Riverside Drive and two short blocks to Broadway and all its shops and restaurants. I'd stay here again."
12318,73681558,9/5/16,18093383,Farid,"Ronnette was a nice host. She is very busy so we met only 2 times I think, but she set up everything to make me feel like at home : the bedroom is very large, everything was clean, and I had my own bathroom ! She was also nice to let me check out on evening to catch my plane. The location is splendid near Riverside, Broadway and Central park : I like this place !"
12318,80914754,20/6/16,73599156,Carmen-Maria,"My stay at Cynthia's home was great. It was my first time that I booked via airbnb and I did not regret it. I had a huge room (two persons would have enough space; there is also a desk in case you have to work, a TV) and a private bathroom. The room itself was really nice (much nicer than in the picture). Everything was clean. There were enough towels. I could also use the kitchen (e.g., refrigerator). I met my host once in person. She was very nice. Moreover, the location is quite good - the 1 train is 5 minutes away on foot.
To sum it up - this is an excellent accommodation (better than any Hilton hotel in NY)! I would book it again."
12318,100490342,9/9/16,75723254,Andrew,"Ronnette's room is in a Great (Website hidden by Airbnb) is easy to everywhere in Manhattan by Metro and bus.Cynthia with Ronnette are easy for communication and quick response.They make us like at home.Definitely I will stay  here again when I am in NYC.Thanks Ronnette for all of the preparation and guideline for food,sightseeing and traffic.We are enjoy staying."

12318,108547610,16/10/16,42330642,Catherine,"If I return to New York, I will arrange my vacation dates around the availability of Cynthia's West Side Retreat.  I don't ever want to stay anyplace else in Manhattan!  It was awesome!"
12318,113931642,14/11/16,6934877,Candace,"This place was absolutely perfect for me.  The room and the apartment are gorgeous, as is the neighborhood; my bathroom small but very well-appointed.  Because of her very demanding job, I didn't actually meet my host until the last evening of my stay (when we ended up talking into the wee hours:).  There was a helpful pamphlet with all necessary information and  we communicated via written notes.  The one time there was a problem she responded constructively within 20 minutes.  For those who need more hand-holding in regards to functioning in NYC, this might be a bit daunting; but as said, for me, it was perfect and I look very much forward to returning very soon!"
12318,120915715,12/12/16,40388834,Dermot,"Cynthia's place was ideal for staying when visiting my daughter in NYC.

Unfortunately I never got the opportunity to meet the hostess."

12318,130683302,7/2/17,6601576,David,This is my second time there. One of my favorite places to stay. Bedroom is big and the bed is comfy. Love the way the apartment looks. Your own bathroom too and nice kitchen facilities. Great host.  
12318,192041852,9/9/17,145240565,Will,"This was my first AirBnb experience and my first trip to the city and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. But, Cyn and Roni made the experience a pleasant and smooth one and I had a great time staying here. The room is large and having your own private bathroom is a great perk. Kitchen is available for use whenever you need it which is great. The neighborhood is pleasant and can be surprisingly quiet which is nice to come home to after along day. Cyn and Roni both communicated very quickly and made sure I had what I needed to enjoy my stay. Would definitely recommend to others looking for a place to stay in the city."
12318,196262532,22/9/17,149547513,Sharon,"I really appreciate the opportunity to utilize the UWS Retreat.  That is exactly what it ended up being for me. Traveling to NYC for business, it was nice to have a place to relax and recharge in between meetings. Thank you so much for your hospitality!"
12318,206925098,27/10/17,24162278,Marie-Claude,"La chambre correspond bien aux photos, elle est vaste et confortable  mais manque un peu d'espace de rangements ( surtout pour un séjour de 3 semaines). L'arrivée était bien organisée. L'appartement est bien équipé, le quartier est très agréable, bien desservi par les transports en commun ( métro, bus ), tout près d'un grand parc au bord de l'Hudson, avec de nombreux commerces à proximité.  Dommage que je n'aie pas pu rencontrer Ronnette, mais j'ai passé un très bon séjour et j'espère revenir chez elle lors de mon prochain passage à New York"

12318,265913895,18/5/18,42834021,Richard,"Clean when I arrived but no plans by host to clean the bathroom and replace linen after the first week of my two week stay.
Wifi is extremely slow - slow to load pictures and don't even bother with movies like youtube. Host is already aware of this but didn't seem to have any plans to improve it.
Otherwise it's a charming old world apartment in a good location close to subway station and walking distance to many Manhattan attractions."
12343,22488,2/1/10,55352,Linda,"It is a lovely, uncluttered apartment and a warm and peaceful retreat after the excitement and chaos of NYC. We were a bit shocked at first appearances by Harlem but grew to appreciate its history, culture and current development. Earl's place is close to the subway and has  good access to New York.  
Earl is indeed warm, welcoming and responsive.  He lives on site but left us to our own devices unless we asked for something.  I would have liked to spend a bit more time talking to Earl and gaining his insights and knowledge.  It also would have  been helpful to have a few more kitchen basics such as a toaster and a microwave.
Thanks for a lovely stay."
12343,46634,26/5/10,125867,Berris,"I loved the apt it was the type I would rent if I was going to stay in NYC. It is a lovely, uncluttered apartment and a warm and peaceful retreat. There were a few draw backs like no micro-wave and the apt is on the third floor of a walk up, but it gets you in shape.  Earl is too smooth as a host and very informative of his neighborhood and the city.I would use it again and recommend it to others.   "
12343,92360,7/9/10,208388,Sandra U. (Sandy),"The space was lovely and very convenient for our needs.  Although some of the furniture needs updating, everything was immaculate and Earl was MOST accommodating.  We would return again with pleasure."

12343,118414,13/10/10,229491,Valeria,"El departamento es muy bonito y cómodo, tal como se lo ve en las fotos. Earl es muy amable, hospitalario y está muy atento a que todo resulte confortable. EL barrio es muy bonito, y hay cerca lugares muy singulares para escuchar jazz, que no son los típicos puestos para el turismo. Earl sabe de jazz y es muy buen orientador al respecto."
12343,230968,18/4/11,441860,Chaneé,"This is truly your BEST BET IN HARLEM!  The comfortable apartment was steps away from the subway, great restaurants, and tourist attractions.  Earl was amazing, he gave us the keys, answered our questions and left us to enjoy his wonderful apartment.  The apartment was SUPER clean and relaxing (some mornings it took forever for us to leave, it felt like home). Thanks Earl, I'll definitely look for your place again when I return to NYC.  "
12343,241590,26/4/11,487722,Bastian,"What a great stay!! I can absolutely recommend this apartment (entire apartment for yourself)! Earl is VERY nice and kind and showed us around the apartment when we arrived. We had a great great time. The area is great too, and we felt safe at all times! Parking right in front of the house. Fast Internet, TV.. The apartment is exactly like on the pictures, maybe even a bit nicer. It is quiet and a perfect place to rest. I had no idea that NYC can be this relaxing!!"
12343,501932,5/9/11,796663,Belinda,"Wonderful location a totally authentic New York experience by staying in Harlem. We really enjoyed our stay with Earl in Harlem and cant thank him enough.

The apartment is huge, comfortable and has everything that helped to make our stay in NYC so great.

Thanks for having us Earl and we look forward to seeing you in Australia some time.  "
12343,603766,6/10/11,264703,Laura,"Earl's apartment is really great, very spacious and uncluttered, with lots of closet space and a comfortable bed, and a very nice view from the bedroom on a green and silent back-garden, and from the large living room on a very pleasant street. So the nights are amazingly silent and quiet, but still you are just a few steps from lively Lenox avenue and 125st Street. Harlem is a fantastic neighborhood to stay, and with subway you're just minutes from Upper westside, and less than half an hour from downtown: great! Earl was most welcoming and nice, and I strongly reccomend his place in NYC"
12343,620279,11/10/11,1189599,Nikita,The apartment was absolutely perfect and matched our expectations very well. It is situated on the best subway line in NYC with easy access to any part of the city at all times. The neighborhood is also very safe at  and filled with great soul food specialty restaurants! Earl and his sister were great and always smiling hosts and their welcome made our stay that much more enjoyable.
12343,641757,18/10/11,237672,Liisa,We had a great stay at this place.  The hosts are absolutely super.  The roomy apartment is just as pretty as the pictures.  The neighborhood is friendly and convenient for everything.  
12343,686595,2/11/11,173880,Pali,"This is a spacious, bright, clean, thoughtfully prepared apartment that is dedicated to short term rental purposes (not a situation where the owner vacates while guest occupies).  It is located on the fourth floor of an owner-occupied classic New York ""brownstone"" building dating from around 1900.  The carpeted stairs are quite steep so this unit is not recommended for anyone lacking full mobility. 

 The huge L-shaped leather sofa was an unexpected amenity. The interior shows some traces of rough use over the years, but overall the finish is quite good.  Earl followed-up promptly on all communications and was extremely helpful on check-in.  I will return.  W. J. Paliguest.  "

It is exactly what you expect form the pictures, in a quiet street  steps away from lively Lennox Av. and 125th, Apollo theater...  And so many ways to get downtown in barely 15 minutes!  Best in Harlem."
12343,1172260,23/4/12,2118784,Kirsty,"Earl's apartment in Harlem is lovely and felt just like home!  It had everything that we needed during our stay and is easy access to the subway.  The bedroom is very large and spacious, as is the living area.  It was a very pleasant change to the small hotel rooms that we had been staying in!

The entire process was made very easy as Earl lives in another apartment in the same building, which meant that the key exchange was easy and he was available if we had any questions or concerns.  Earl was very welcoming and made sure that we had everything that we needed before providing us with our space and privacy.  

Thanks Earl for a lovely stay!"
12343,1273105,13/5/12,2124049,Carly,"An incredibly clean and spacious apartment, pictures do not do it justice. Earl was a very gracious and accommodating host. If the bed were a bit more comfortable it would definitely be a 5-star!!! "
12343,1442939,9/6/12,2252840,Vicky,"Great space, excellent host, clean accomodations.  We loved the neighborhood & wished we could have stayed longer.  Earl was very helpful, but not intrusive as a host.  Generally speaking this one was of the quietest neighborhoods I've stayed in for NYC.  Street traffic fairly minimal.

The brownstone is large enough to feel like home!  walk to subway is easy & the 2 & 3 trains get you downtown very quickly.  Probably not the best if you hate stairs or have mobility issues, but was perfect for us. Harlem went right to the top of my list for next trip to the city."

Only a four or six block walk from the subway, we could get to anywhere we wanted to downtown or elsewhere in 30 minutes tops.  We didn't see much of Earl but he was always charming when we ran into him."
12343,3625358,26/2/13,4385047,Katharina,"The stay at Earl's apartment made our trip to NYC very special: the flat is clean, bright and spacious and Earl probably the nicest host in the city ; ) Meeting up for the keys was very easy, check-in/check-out times were flexible. We stayed 4 nights in Harlem, which we liked a lot - just around the corner there are cafes for a good start in the day and nice restaurants for a night out (e.g. astor row cafe, corner social). Check out the schedule of world-famous Apollo Theatre on 125th! Public transport is very close, the Central Park even in walking distance (10 min). Earl, thank you very much, we really enjoyed it!"
12343,4097639,9/4/13,3462590,Catherine,"Earl est un propriétaire souriant, serviable et attentionné!
Son appartement est propre, typique et merveilleusement situé dans Harlem non loin du métro (135ème rue) et de tous les petits commerces. 
Le quartier est très animé mais calme la nuit et sûr.
Le seul petit bémol, s'il fallait en trouver un, serait de n'avoir croisé Earl qui réside au rez de chaussée de l'immeuble, que le soir de notre arrivée et le matin de notre départ!
Nous aurions aimé partager un peu plus de temps avec lui!"
12343,4429932,5/5/13,1648957,Martina,"Earl è un padrone di casa cortese, efficiente e sempre sorridente. Il suo appartamento è ben curato e molto ospitale: bella sala che dà sulla 131st e bella camera da letto che si affaccia su un back yard. Con un solo problema: mancano le tende oscuranti e dalle sette del mattino la stanza è inondata dalla luce, ma è molto silenziosa. La cucina è dotata di tutti gli utensili necessari e c'è una lavastoviglie. La casa è proprio nel cuore di Harlem, a quattro isolati dal subway. Vicino ci sono anche numerosi ristoranti, incluso il famoso Silvya's. Ottimo il check in e perfetto il check-out: Earl ci ha anche prenotato il taxi per l'aeroporto e alle 6 del mattino era lì, sorridente, a salutarci. Posto da raccomandare caldamente."
12343,4680800,20/5/13,1514723,Philipp,"It's a really good apartment, actually bigger than it looks on the photos, in a beautiful brownstone house in a quiet street. A main metro line and a supermarket are nearby, as well as well-rated restaurants. We recommend Yatenga French Bistro and Bar just around the corner.
Earl is a wonderful host, really nice and relaxed."
12343,4828515,28/5/13,3756770,Justin,Earl was very easy to communicate with for getting and returning the keys. Place was great too. Totally happy with the stay and would happily recommend to others.
12343,5115269,13/6/13,6152983,Deanne,"Earl is a warm, welcoming host. He was waiting for us on the steps when we arrived and cheerfully interacting with neighbours on the street. He was kind enough to give us a bit of an over view of the area and  a few 'tourist' ideas to consider. The place is quite large and surprisingly quiet. The bedroom is in the back, and faces another yard not an alley so this helps. Couple of things that could have been better: the bathroom shows it's age; a few more reading lights would have been nice (we were there for a week so did spend some time in); and the wifi was spotty. Otherwise, Earl was super at dealing with any request.

Overall, a great location in Harlem, great host and good value."
12343,5346708,25/6/13,6492830,Paula,"We came to Earl's with our 16-year-old niece. He greeted us on arrival, and got us all settled into the very spacious, spotless apartment on the 3rd floor (just as described and pictured in airbnb). We had a fabulous weekend, leaving home early and coming  home late on the nearby subway (remember it's the RED one!). It's a charming neighbourhood - the kind where people say hello to you and chat in the shops (highlights were the Nigerian all-things-African mini-emporium and the Yemeni corner store). Don't miss the Studio Museum on 125th (Website hidden by Airbnb) Chez Lucienne, the Corner Social were great, and the Red Rooster was super but get there early-ish before the glitterati spoil the service. Earl booked us a car to the airport and, bless his heart, saw us off at 6:30 a.m. I will be recommending this place to all my friends so book early! Thank you Earl: it was unforgettable. "
12343,6911032,30/8/13,4585969,Stephanie,"I stayed at Earls flat on the end of August 2013. It was realy great! Earl is a very gentil and warm  host. It was  a pleasure for me to meet him! The appartment is spacious, beautiful and very clean!  It's situateted in a quiet and nice street in Harlem. Harlem is a very intressting place in New York where you can feel absolutly safe. The people are very kind and helpful. The  6 days we stayed there are unforgetable! 
Earl, whenever you like to visit Frankfurt, let me know! All the best for you!"
12343,6985937,2/9/13,6813929,Kat,"Earl's place is great. Don't waste your time online screening all the other places, just book it. Its a really gorgeous apartment (very clean) in a pretty street and a friendly neighbourhood close to shops and train and even a a community garden! Earl is a super nice host. He really looked out for the four of us."
12343,7094703,6/9/13,6698608,Norberto Dionisio,Earl is a person always smiling! helped me in all that I asked. the area is excellent for lovers of Harlem.

12343,7977917,11/10/13,7114637,Annett,"Absolut pünktlich stand Earl zum verabredeten Zeitpunkt vor der Tür um uns nach langer Anreise zu empfangen. Wir waren sehr glücklich die Wohnung in dem Zustand vorzufinden wie sie auf den Bildern zu sehen und beschrieben war.
In diesem völlig gemütlichen und ungestörten Heim kann man sich sehr wohl fühlen - ruhig, sauber und komfortabel genug.
Für alle Ladies - ihr könnt eueren Fön daheim lassen (wegen des 110 V Problems) und für die Männer - es sind zwei Adapter für die Steckdosen vorhanden. Das Wifi funktioniert gut, allerdings am Besten am Küchentisch. Eine absolut empfehlenswerte Wohnung für New York! Danke Earl



Earl was absolutely punctually at the appointed time at the door to welcome us after a long journey. We were very happy that the apartment also reflects exactly in the condition as it was seen and described in the pictures.
In this completely undisturbed and cozy home can feel very comfortable - quiet, clean and comfortable enough.
For all the ladies - you can let your hair dryer at home (due to the 110 V problem), and for the men - there are two adapters for the electrical outlets available. The wifi works well, but is best at the kitchen table.
An absolutely recommendable apartment for New York! Thank you Earl

The apartment is extremely clean and spacious and much bigger than pictures shown. Harlem is a great place to stay, and very safe, already looking at dates next year to go back. Really, don't waste your time looking for anything else, Earl best bet really is splendid."
12343,8583401,6/11/13,3235538,Jonathan,"Awesome stay! Was in town to run the marathon and Earl made my stay that much more amazing. The place is large, VERY comfortable and kept very well. In a beautiful brownstone in lovely Harlem, the location also worked really well for what I needed to do, mostly uptown. Earl was always available but found I didn't have any issue to call him, other than to coordinate getting keys and my departure. 

Highly recommend!!"
12343,8686854,12/11/13,8697585,Tim,"Just perfect. Earl was a very welcoming and helpful host, and the entire area was a delight. We arrived near dusk, by subway and walked with cases 4 blocks to the flat. Within 90 minutes we were at an African bistro (Les Ambassades) with live Jazz and, like everywhere in Harlem) a very welcoming atmosphere.
Would recommend the flat and the area to anyone who can make it up 2 flights of stairs!
Many thanks for your hospitality Earl.

12343,9051601,3/12/13,9014297,Laura,The place is much bigger than it seems in the pictures! We had everything we needed here for coffee and cooking. And the bed was so warm during the cold weather! Earl was very helpful and informative and even helped us get a car service to take us to the airport for our departure.

12343,9267871,17/12/13,4649393,Katarina,"Earl was so accommodating and patient!  His place is much larger than it looks in the pictures.  Everything was clean.  He does not charge a cleaning fee either.  This part of town was a bit dingy compared to the more touristy parts of Manhattan but we felt safe.  The only negative as far as transport does is that the Harlem area will require a transfer or two if you are coming from anywhere other than the west side of Central Park, and at night that could mean up to an hour to get home."
12343,9536329,2/1/14,4547484,Bruno,"Great location. 
Close to many shops (H & M, GAP, Marshalls, Foot Locker, Game Stop, etc. ...), two good supermarkets nearby. 
Many options for breakfast. 
Liquor store, Applebees, CVS. 
Very close to subway and several bus lines. 
Apartment very clean, organized and well maintained. Heating working perfectly. Well equipped kitchen, and comes with some groceries ... lol. All equipment working perfectly. 
Earl is an excellent host, who made us very comfortable and always available for any eventuality. Very obliging. 
We miss him, Bus (the dog), and the time we spent there. 
Indicated his apartment to all who ask. 
Very good!"
12343,9707302,6/1/14,9563174,Victoria,"Best bed in Harlem! Earl was great, the apartment was warm, comfy, spacious, clean and highly functional and only a few blocks away from the metro. It's the little details like soft sheets, cozy couch, cleared sidewalks that made us extremely happy we chose to stay at Earl's over a more central manhattan place , we found ourselves wishing to get 'home' after a long awesome day in the city.  
thumbs up!"
12343,11451921,3/4/14,12698610,Sue,"We had a lovely stay at Earl's place. The apartment was large, bright and very spacious. It was clean and well supplied. It is the entire top floor of a brownstone and has wonderfull character, as does the entire street
Earl was a great host, who was available to answer our questions but gave us complete privacy otherwise. He greeted us on arrival and was there to say goodbye as we left. He arranged our car to the airport for us. 
The neighbourhood was very safe feeling and had lot's of interesting things to do and great places to eat and listen to music
We would highly recommend this apartment

 "
12343,12118938,23/4/14,12447940,Shira,"My parents, my brother and I stayed at Earl's for a week this April. It was our first AirBNB experience and we couldn't be more pleased. Earl was extremely helpful and accommodating, you could tell he's very experienced, and ALWAYS had a huge smile on his face. When I twisted my ankle on our last night he let us all stay in the apartment the entire next day til we left for our flight at 8pm. Not a even a whisper about extra payment.
The apartment was exactly as promised, clean, large, quiet, well kept, well equipped, tons of electric sockets, wifi that worked, tons of linen and blankets, a drawer full of tourist information and maps - even umbrellas! We used the kitchen a lot and had two family meals at the table every day.
The location is convenient for Harlem, 5 minute walk from the 2 and 3 subways and a minute walk from a supermarket and tons of restaurants. It's on the second floor of an old, pretty brownstone and you can really feel the cool vibe of the neighborhood. Also feels completely safe.
Things that could be better? The pullout bed could definitely be firmer, and sometimes there are smells of cooking coming in. That's it. Definitely Best Bet in Harlem :)"
12343,12430358,2/5/14,11168582,Aenohe,"Earl is extremely kind and pleasant person. We have seen and heard him only twice, once we arrived and second time when he ordered taxi for us to JFK.

Neighborhood was o.k. There were some people on the streets late on night when we came home but no one gave us any trouble or even approached us.

Apartment is same as in pictures, clean nice sheets and very nice towels. Even if it looks far away from the Downtown it isn't. Using metro lines 2,3 it takes only 15 min. to the Times square.

I can only recommend both Earl and his apartment to any one going to the NYC."
12343,13245338,23/5/14,14207883,Helen,"What a blessing for us to stay at Earl's place as we celebrated our son's graduation from NYU!  We loved the apartment and the neighborhood.  It truly made us feel like 'New Yorkers' instead of 'Time Square' tourists.  Having a hot cup of coffee ready in the kitchen before heading out into the craziness was a wonderful treat.  The apartment is bright, clean, quiet, and full of character.  I loved the simplicity of the space without any clutter or fussyness.  Earl is a superb host!  Can't wait to come back to visit soon!

12343,13564800,31/5/14,440084,Dina,"Earl was every bit as wonderful as others have described.  What a warm, relaxed, and lovely soul.

I really loved Harlem, and I really loved Earl's place."

12343,15814193,16/7/14,12573753,Anna,We have been very comfortable in Earl's apartment in Harlem. It's a good option to stay in New york. We travelled there with a two years old boy and the main problem was the subway (not everywhere elevators). Earl was there to meet us and when we had a doubt he solved quickly  (whattsup available)
12343,16323431,25/7/14,17707635,Brij,What a great stay with such a great host! Perfect location to all transport. Great vibes around the neighbourhood. Flat was extremely tidy and so cosy. Perfect stay in NYC!! Definitely coming back!
12343,16894191,4/8/14,7516741,Jesus,"Earl was really friendly and helpful. The neighborhood is in a good location in Harlem, near to supermarkets, restaurants and a great jazz bar that opens on weekends. It is a calm and safe neighborhood and the building is quite close to the subway. 

The house is fairly clean. We were four people sleeping on a bed in the bedroom and a sofa bed in the living room. The bed was really comfortable but the sofa bed was uncomfortable which can be annoying if you stay long. There's also a futon in the bedroom that we didn't use. 

Altogether it was a good experience."
12343,18149075,22/8/14,2720152,Jeramie,"My wife and I were in NYC for a last summer hurrah, and chose Earl's place based on the numerous positive reviews he's received. The place itself is on a quiet Harlem street not far from two subway stations and easily within walking distance of an abundance of great food spots. It's secure, very clean/stylish, and more than enough room for the two of us. Earl was extremely friendly and gave us a good rundown of the area since neither of us had experienced Harlem before. If the place is open for our next trip out, I wouldn't hesitate to book it again! "

He even introduced us some of his neighbours on the street when we ran into him after shopping on our first evening in Harlem. Earl is very responsive and answered to all our queries within minutes. So we felt very well taken care of and we trust that Earl would also have helped us if we had run into any trouble during our stay in New York.

We loved Earl's apartment. It looks very much like in the pictures. It is spacy, equiped with everything you need and also very convenient with the subway just 4 streets away and plenty of food stores and restaurants nearby. For breakfast or brunch we often went to the Astor Row Cafe on the corner of Lenox Avenue and 130th street. We felt quite save in the neigborhood. When we returned home late in the evenings, there were still many people on the street, in particluar between 125th and 130th Street where there are quite a lot of restaurants and where people minded their own business. More upwards towards 135th Street there were more younger people just hanging around, but if you ignored them they would generally ignore you too."
12343,21197283,13/10/14,6719721,Yossi,"I’ve stayed chez Earl almost 3 wonderful weeks. He is a great host, friendly, correct and very responsive. In the heart of Harlem, in a good vibe middle class street that felt safe day & night, the apartment has nice spaces, good light and well preserved brownstone character. It is basically furnished with good and calm taste. There’s everything you need within minutes walking. Taking the subway downtown could take between 30 to 60 min. Good value for a NYC base and a great experience of Harlem culture."

Das Appollo Theater liegt um die Ecke, und auch sonst bietet Harlem viel. Die Wohnung ist unglaublich ruhig – kaum zu glauben, dass man sich in NYC und nicht irgendwo auf dem Land befindet. Die Wohnung besteht aus zwei sehr geräumigen, sauberen und hellen Zimmern und liegt im obersten Stockwerk des dreistöckigen Hauses.

The living room has a very big and comfortable couch, much better than you can see in the photos right here. And there is the tv too. The large table is perfect for family meals (we were two adults from Italy and a kid of 13). The apartment is located on the top of a two floors pre-war building (that kind of lovely brownstones style) in a very safe part of Harlem (people are friendly and smiling) close to everything: subway (from 3 to 10 minutes walking, depends on which line you want to get); supermarket (3 minutes), laundromat (3 minutes), lovely restaurants (4 minutes) and shops and parks and the famous Shiloh church where Gospel mass is scheduled on sundays. And there are around (5 minutes) even amazing basketball courts. Besides, you can go walking to North Central Park where, during the summer, you can enjoy the public swimming pool (free entrance, just a sturdy lock requested), a really newyorker experience. But the ""thing"" we loved most has been Earl, a lovable and kind host. We saw him just twice in two weeks but we always had the confortable feeling he was around ready to show up in case of need. We've had a truly wonderful time there, feeling like being home. So that we've forgotten on the fridge two magnets we had bought as small souvenirs, but never mind. We have surely left our hearts down there in Earl's best bet in Harlem. We love you."

12627,226035141,8/1/18,23667273,Hannah,"Rana is an excellent host and welcomed us over (Hidden by Airbnb) as her friend, Wendy, met us in person to help us get settled. The location is five stars! Surrounded by delicious restaurants and cute shops while only a seven minute walk to the subway. Highly recommend it if your looking to visit Brooklyn and Manhattan."
12627,233693281,10/2/18,79522389,U.S. - Asia Law Institute,"I really enjoyed my stay. Rana was a very responsive host. She always answered my questions immediately. She arranged a neighbor to give me the key card and show me around the apartment upon my arrival- who was also very nice. I am usually concerned that Airbnb is not as clean as hotels, but this apartment is super CLEAN and spacious! I liked the bed in particular, with firm mattress, clean and quality sheets.  I felt quite relaxed the whole time in the apartment.  And the location is ideal, only a couple of blocks away from Prospect Park Station. I definitely recommend this place."
12627,314918351,27/8/18,74120064,Taryn,My boyfriend and I stayed at Rana’s apartment for 3 days and it was nothing short of perfect for our stay. Everything you need is in walking distance and everywhere you need to go is a short 15-25 minute drive. The apartment was clean and it had a decent balcony that overlooked Brooklyn. Would definitely stay here again.

12937,52630,13/6/10,70051,Andre,"I had an excellent time at Orestes' place in NYC.

Quiet place with a private entrance to come back home at whatever time you want without disturbing anyone.

Laundromat around the corner and the closest subway is literally one block away, where the 7 train goes all the way into Times Square. Also two blocks away you have the E train that also goes into Manhattan and the G train that goes into Brooklyn.

In the area there's still a cozy and cheap diner that's open 24/7, a few stores to get supplies and a few other places of interest. Location was excellent, 10 minutes away from everything.

The room was great and packed with a mini fridge, coffee maker, TV, a sofa, full size bed and walk-in closet. There was also a private bathroom that had everything you needed and a very good shower.

There's also a garden out back where you can go outside in the mornings and just relax, eat breakfast, etc.

Orestes was a great host and gave me a lot of good spots to go sightseeing. Good person to chat with and quite knowledgeable about the city.

I think that for the price, you simply can't get any better."
12937,106713,27/9/10,232362,Sharinne,"Orestes was a great host and a nice guy.  The room was clean, comfortable, and cozy.  Also, his historic home is gorgeously decorated, really reflecting the level of detail that Orestes has in ensuring a nice experience for his guests.  The location was very convenient - easy parking and 1 block away from the subway.  We had a great time staying here and I would definitely recommend it! "
12937,112400,5/10/10,239469,Virginia,"This is very upscale and chic lodging in Hunters Point.  Everything about the room is positive, especially the warmth and friendliness of the host.  It is convenient (less than 2 blocks) to the subway and I was in the city in 10 minutes.  Lots of restaurants within walking distance and small coffee shops, laundromat, delis, etc.  It is a safe area, and you will especially love the totally restored units to the 1880s feeling, but with modern conveniences."

I enjoyed being surrounded by beautiful artwork in a serene and rich environment that was created in Orestes' vision. If the weather had been warmer, I would have spent some time in his garden oasis. The location is convenient to midtown and Brooklyn without the Manhattan price tag. Plus, there's a great coffee shop/restaurant around the corner and an authentic 24hr. diner in the neighborhood."

12937,129328,29/10/10,247922,Lydia,I had a great time staying here with my family. Orestes was extremely nice and thoughtful of us as guests. The room is lovely and the bathroom is great. As a whole it was a relaxing week here. With a beautiful garden and access to everything we need regarding accommodation. Better than any hotel I would say. And Orestes I thought I left my shoes there. They are pretty old anyway so you can throw them out! Thanks!!

12937,250962,4/5/11,11736083,Delia,"We wanted a place to stay close to everything but quiet and comfortable and we got it.   Orestes is a great guy and his place is beautiful.  We could be  in central Manhatten in10 minutes, the 7 line is a 2 minute walk just around the corner.  But when we were tired we could relax here, in perfect peace and quiet.    We always felt safe and welcome.   Thanks Orestes- we'll definitely come back."
12937,592983,3/10/11,1004803,Mandy,"What a wonderful holiday and a wonderful place to stay! We were unsure about staying in Queens is opposed to Manhattan, worried that we might feel slightly out of the way, but we had absolutely no need to worry at all - the subway is round the corner (next to the best chinese take-away ever!) and really does take you to the thick of it within ten minutes. There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!
The house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.
As a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!
There was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful. I honestly can't wait to go back and I want to take all of my friends. Don't hesitate to stay here.
Thanks Orestes, it was fabulous x"
12937,852184,9/1/12,1486914,Jenny,"My husband and I stayed for a week in January; the room and bathroom were warm, very clean, visually appealing, and comfortable.  We met Orestes briefly, as he was out of town most of the time, and he is extremely hospitable and helpful.  Chris, who was around the rest of the time, was also kind and available for any questions.
The location is convenient to a grocery store, decent diner, and several subway lines; it's pretty simple to get to Queens, Brooklyn, or Manhattan.
Future guests should be aware that while the guest room itself might be non-smoking, the rest of the house isn't.  Most of the evenings the cigarette smoke was unavoidable, though not too bad if you kept the door to the guest room shut.  (Being first-trimester-pregnant, my nose and nausea levels felt sensitive to this, but I imagine it wouldn't be an issue for most folks, unless you had asthma or some other sensitivity.)
On whole, it was a good home base for our week in New York; everyone was friendly and the accommodations were nice."
12937,996986,13/3/12,1795764,Mistie,"Orestes was a great host!  He was very helpful with any questions I asked him, and I had a lot :)  It was my first time in NYC, and he definitely made it easier with his recommendations (especially when it came to public transportation.)  He has a beautiful home.  I wanted to take that shower home with me!  Heaven!  Great location too!  The E train and 7 train were about a block away, and there is a 24 hour diner right around the corner!"
12937,1035186,23/3/12,1602938,Cleo & Laure,"We stayed two nights at Orestes' and it was, from far, our best AirBnB experience ever. The very spacious room is in a Queens historic district (very close to 5ptz, PS1 Moma and a typical American Diner...). We had everything we needed (wifi, clean and big private bathroom, comfortable  bed...). We absolutely recommend this place (which is only one stop from Manhattan - Lexington Av. /49th). "
12937,1123095,13/4/12,1392061,Morten,"In the beginning we wanted to stay at a hotel in central Manhattan, but fortunately for us we saw Orestes room on the internet and it was an even better place to stay. It was great to be able to withdraw to the Queens peace and quiet after a long day in Manhattan - and only one subway stop away. Orestes house is located in a historically beautiful street and the room is comfortably furnished with a touch of creative people. Nice bathroom with a shower big enough for two and the sunny garden was beautiful.

It was nice to meet Orestes and Cristiàns hospitality, helpfulness and kindness and Kikki, the dog of the house, always greeted us welcome. We felt very welcome and our expectations were fully met. We will certainly return to this place again when we visit New York next time and can only give our warmest recommendations to this place.
"
12937,1405030,3/6/12,2185519,Francois,A dream week in a fantastic place and a great guy named Orestes. Everything was much more than expected including the location just one stop from Manhattan by the airtrain/subway. Hope to go back there as soon as possible. Thank you Orestes. 
12937,1486656,15/6/12,308976,Oliver,"Great host, very nice and understanding. Location was fantastic and interior photos don't do the place justice, its even nicer than it looks. Lots of good restaurants in the area too. "

His house and the room were amazing.  His place is very clean, comfortable, and extremely well decorated!  We loved the amazing shower and the adorable dog!

I can say without a doubt, that we'll be referring some friends to him and if we have the opportunity to come back to New York again we will definitely be staying here again.

Highly recommended!"
12937,1677023,10/7/12,305811,James,"Orestes is a great host.  His place is amazing.  The room is more like a suite in that it has a couch to watch TV in addition to a very comfotable bed.  There is also a small fridge  and coffee machine.  During our stay the temp was over 100 degrees outside but the room has great A/C so we were very comfortable.  Also, the room is super quiet.  The bathroom is fantasic....huge!  Great dog named KIKI too.

The location is 1 block away from the 7 train.  You can't beat this.  10 min to Grand Central Station and Central Park....15 min to Times Square.  The neighbor hood has many great places to eat.  I highly recommend LIC Cafe which is 1 block away.  

This is the ONLY place to stay in NYC!!!"

The room has all you need and the bed was very comfortable.

Thank you Orestes - we will come back!"
12937,1917439,7/8/12,2994498,Hagay,"About location:
Great location! 5 min from Manhattan. Great neighborhood with laundry service, few market places to provide us all we needed and an Indian restaurant right over the corner. 3 minute walk to the subway!

About the house:
Great room! big. with A/C, T.V, fridge and coffee table. Towels available in the room and in the shower. All clean and neat. Big private shower. Big beautiful yard to enjoy breakfast.  Perfect. We really enjoyed staying there.

About the owner:
We had a nice conversation over the phone. I felt comfortable with my decision to book his place .Orestes the owner had his friend Gabbi waiting for us when we arrived. She guided us through out our visit and made us feel at  home.  She was kind enough to spend time on the computer, explaining us where to go and how to get there, as well as many important tips that made the difference in our trip. We were lucky to have her.

we had such a great time at Orestes home and what a lovely home it is. we received a warm welcome and were made to feel at home. Everything about our stay couldn't have gone any better. Orestes gave us plenty info about the area, highlighting interesting places to eat and gave us travel advice which saved us a bit. We have kept in touch and will be going back next year. We just wish we were still there.

Many thanks Orestes
Was great meeting you!!

12937,2641719,17/10/12,2169727,Nuanthip,"The house located near subway only a few minutes walk. The room is comfortable and restroom is clean. I will stay here again if I plan to visit New York. Thank you Mr. Orates for a lovely place to stay,"
12937,2778455,1/11/12,302883,Michael,"Designed by a gifted mind this place is an amazing spot to start discovering New York. The rooms and lavatories are very clean and it is obvious Orestes and Christian care about their home! It's very close to a Metro station which takes you to 5th Avenue and Central Park just within minutes. Well, when there isn't a superstorm approaching where most of the public transport gets shut down. But luckily we survived Sandy and felt very safe at this place. And on the day of our departure Orestes was kind enough to take us to that one Metro station which startet operating on a low level routine again and made it easy for us getting to Manhattan. 
However, as half of NYC was without electricity during our stay we have to come back and will hopefully stay here again!"
12937,3827089,18/3/13,5162812,Iliana,"We had a great time in Orestes .I can highly recommend  staying with him.The place is great,very close to Manhattan ,and we were glad choosing that place over the other and the cost connecting with being there.The place is  very well designed .I wish I could be that talanted,but I will steels some ideas anyway.We had great chat and helped us when needed,other wise we felt as we were there on our own.Book with confidence."
12937,3871770,23/3/13,3571267,Susan,"This was my first experience with an Airbnb stay and it surpassed my expectations!  Orestes is a gracious host who made me feel very welcome, taking time to show me his home and tell me about the area. His home has a wonderfully warm ambiance that is reflected in the room (and private bath!) I stayed in...both clean and spacious.  This historic street is a beautiful neighborhood setting and two subway stations (there might be more but I was just getting my bearings!) are within a few minutes walk that take you right into Manhattan.  This Airbnb experience made for a perfect mini-getaway!  Thank you, Orestes!"
12937,4427739,5/5/13,4842968,Giusy,"Two words alone would be enough to describe staying at Orestes...Simply Amazing!!! Orestes’ home exudes a special warmness, also thanks to its interesting décor which comes from the mind of two very talented people. Orestes and Cristian are wonderful, friendly and warm hosts; they made us feel extremely welcome and at home from the moment we arrived. As for location, we couldn't have asked for a better one. The triplets are ideally located on a quiet historic street where we could rest peacefully after long days spent out & about, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. There are loads of nice restaurants (try LIC Market if you get the chance, great food & atmosphere!) and shops close by as well as a 24/7 diner; just minutes away from Manhattan by subway (with multiple train choices) and only a short walk away from the best view of the skyline you'll experience by far! The room itself is perfect in size, comfortable and very clean; it also has a sofa, TV, mini fridge, coffee maker and walk in wardrobe which, albeit small, is extremely handy! The bathroom has the best shower ever, amazing ...I still miss it & wish I could have taken it back with me ;) Last but not least, there is a lovely garden at the back where you can unwind, soak in the sun or have breakfast al fresco! We really couldn't have wished for better! Thank you Orestes and Cristian for opening your home to us and  for making our stay perfect. Already looking forward to my next stay :)

12937,4504947,9/5/13,40135,Judith,"Staying in Orestes' suite was a great treat. It is comfortable, immaculate, and very tastefully and interestingly decorated. The bathroom/shower is amazing and there is a lovely outdoor garden in the back for when the weather is good. Orestes was welcoming, friendly, and helpful, but not obtrusive -- an ideal host. Long Island City is a very interesting location, lots to explore, and the proximity to Manhattan could not be better. We will most definitely try to stay with Orestes on our next visit to NYC."
12937,4808247,27/5/13,5866449,Janice,"What a great location and comfortable, clean and charming place to stay for a visit to NYC.  All is just as presented in the description for this location.

You will not be disappointed if this is your choice. Orestes is a wonderful responsive host.  "

And it is well located: very close to the metro (3 lines lead directly to midtown Manhattan) and good restaurants.

Orestes was very friendly and gave us lots of interesting tips for NY. This Suite is the perfect place to discover NY and was an excellent home to us. We highly recommend it."
12937,5312200,24/6/13,6008212,Lindsay,"Our family of 3, including our 13 year old daughter recently stayed at Orestes' beautiful home.  The room and bathroom were very clean, spacious and very comfortable.  Sitting outside in a lovely garden having breakfast is something I would never had expected to do. The location is fantastic, we loved the quiet of Queen's and the short walk to the metro which quickly got us into Manhattan.  Orestes and Christian were very helpful and excellent hosts who made our trip run smoothly.  I wouldn't hesitate to highly recommend it to others and the next time I am in New York it would be my first choice."
12937,5384766,27/6/13,6787718,YunChin,Very nice house and Superb location. Our family did enjoy great stay in Orestes House. It is good choice and we will definitely choose this house for next trip to New York.

12937,5736441,14/7/13,6813991,Pam,"I was very disappointed with my first airbnb experience. I was expecting an intimate local experience with the benefit of getting an insider's take on my first visit to the fabulous city that is NY. Unfortunately, Orestes was away on holidays (which I only found out when I rang him a day before I arrived) the whole 5 days I was there. He said a good friend (who introduced herself as his neighbor) would be living there instead. The first day a non-English speaking house-cleaner was there to meet me to pass me the keys. Because I spent the first afternoon sightseeing I arrived to a quiet house at 10.30pm and spent the first night not knowing who was in the house. The next morning at the first sound of noises/footsteps in the house I went upstairs to wait to meet 'the neighbour' before she headed off to work. This was the only time I saw her in my stay but awoke every morning to the sounds of multiply people coming in and out of the only entrance which is through the bottom front door right next to do the guest bedroom.  I was never told who was going to be in the house and by the end of 5 days I counted at least 5 people, one other guy living in the same house (who never introduced himself), a dog walker and work colleagues of Orestes who made use of the 2 workstations in the same level as the bedroom for at least 2 of the days. One work collegue was working until 1 am one morning. Considering there is an opaque ceiling to floor window in the bathroom which is clearly visible from the working area I didn't feel comfortable taking a shower at night. Also my ""private"" bathroom was used by the work colleagues. Although I was out for most of the days, due to the wooden floor boards I could hear people walking/stomping around late at night and early mornings. The photos are accurate, the house is nice. However, the room you stay in is on the basement level along with 2 work place areas. There were written rules left including one never to lock the front door when you were inside (otherwise you can lock others out!). I never heard from Orestes, was never offered help or advice and had no communication who had access to the house.  Disappointing considering all the rave reviews. I would have felt safer and got a lot more personal attention and clearer communication staying in a hotel. My girlfriend who also stayed a couple of nights was also disappointed by the fact we were sightseeing 'blind' and that we had no idea who was in the upper levels of the house. For safer, more personal attention and less wasting time on subways I recommend staying in a hotel around East Village. P.S. my bed sheet was covered in dog hairs."
12937,5984981,25/7/13,6584551,Antje,"We had a great stay at Orestes beautiful home. The roomes were exactly a described and we felt very at home and warmly welcomed.

Te da toda la informacion que le pidas. Conocimos tambien a 2 amigos suyos  Ray (escritor, le regaló un libro a mi hijo) e Ignacio muy atentos y educados. Teniamos todo lo necesario para el aseo (toallas, jabones,..), con nevera, cafetera con cafe,,, , seria interesante tener un pequeño microondas.
Sin duda recomiendo este sitio, metro a la vuelta de la esquina(1 min.), supermercado, buen barrio.. Es tan tipico y bonito que una noche rodaron una pelicula en la puerta de la casa.
Si vuelvo espero hospedarme en este sitio con Oreste.

We had everything you need for grooming (towels, soap, ..), with refrigerator, coffee maker with coffee,,,, it would be interesting to have a small microwave.
I definitely recommend this place, metro just around the corner (1 min.), Supermarket, nice neighborhood .. It is so typical and pretty shot a movie night at the door of the house.

12937,7008827,3/9/13,6499102,Catherine,"My daughter and I  were so pleased that we chose Orestes's beautiful place in  Long Island City Queens for our First B&B experience . He was there to meet us and he had allowed us to arrive an hour early. It was clean and airy and plenty of space allowed us to spread out . He let us settle in and offered to help out if we needed anything.  He also let us have our privacy, although he does use the downstairs space for work, it is not noisy or intrusive and we weren't there much in the day. 
We had a split stay in NY and the first leg we stayed in an impersonal Mid Town Hotel - Just like any other city BUT
Staying in  LIC Queens was a real treat, it is so unique and very close to the river, has awesome city skyline views plus we worked out the subs easy enough and it was as close as he says. It only took us 10 mins on the sub to get home at night!. You walk that much at least to a hotel, and Subs are everywhere.  It was really nice to come home to a quiet space every night.  We also appreciate healthy food options and found really great food at a quality., modern Food cellar supermarket in Long Island City! it was awesome with a huge range of wholesome, organic  salads and healthy choices and only 5 mins walk.
I would absolutely recommend you consider staying here, in a beautiful street, with quiet neighbourhood, a lovely, rare city garden as a treat and so very close to Manhattan.  It is great value all around. Orestes was polite, respectful and helpful as a host. Thanks again Orestes.

12937,7216862,11/9/13,5526539,Matej,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and for sure not last. I can’t imagine better place to stay, really Orestes was perfect host. Unfortunately we do not have time to discuss more as we had been exploring city, but believe that this was not last time we had meet Orestes. :)
Orestes was every time available for our questions and helps us so much. I also really appreciate his big help during last day in NYC as we have been returning from East Hampton and need to leave our luggage for few hours due to late-night flight. Orestes helped us without any discussion.
Perfect for me was that not even house was beautiful but also Orestes is person you can rely on.
Before this experience we have been in NYC but we stayed in hotel, but as I said, no more! For everybody looking for place to stay in NYC this should be first option.
I nearly forgot the location (Website hidden by Airbnb) You have peace for sleep but so close to Manhattan. “Just one stop from Manhattan.” – exactly, take line 7 to Lexinton Ave…
My impressions from whole stay at Orestes’s beautiful house are hart to describe. I will remember this for long long time.
Unfortunately also our stay had one big disadvantage: we had to leave. :))) 
Orestes: Really thank you for everything. I am really happy to know you.

Les lignes de métro étaient parfaites pour se déplacer dans tout Manhattan et il y a même l'East Ferry à quelques blocs, suggéré par Orestes, qui nous a permis de découvrir les rives de l'East River sous un autre jour. Malgré nos horaires ""très touristiques"", Orestes est venu prendre de nos nouvelles et a su nous conseiller dans nos visites. Nous recommandons donc fortement de séjourner chez Orestes.

We really enjoyed staying at Orestes' home. Everything was perfect : Orestes is a very welcoming host, his house is magnificient, in a very quiet area, and peaceful street, you can't be closer from the subway ! Metro lines were perfect to move across all Manhattan and there was even East Ferry a few blocks ago, as Orestes suggested us, so we could discover East River sides. Even with our very ""touristic hours"", Orestes came to take news from you and he gave us advices. We recommand strongly to stay at Orestes' home !"

This was our first time using airbnb and we can't be happier with experience. The room and bathroom was nice and clean, the bed comfortable, and everything was to our liking. The room was exactly as we expected. He even called us a car when we needed to get back to the airport. The subway station was a five minute walk and we got in and out of Manhattan with ease. We were very grateful for your hospitality. We hope to see you again in the future. Thank you again! "
12937,8933704,26/11/13,9817948,Juan,"My wife, my 2 daughters and I recently stayed at Orestes’s place and we had a great time. The bedroom and the bathroom were very clean and comfortable.

A 2min du métro et 15min de Manhattan, idéal pour les journées intenses sur l'île de Manhattant et le calme de cette maison qui est sublime et dont le son vous transporte grâce aux musiques latines/jazzy ! On a eu l'occasion de partager la fameuse dinde de thanksgiving avec nos hotes, un moment inoubliable ! Je recommande ce logement si vous aimez le calme, le comfort et l'art. Cette maison est chaleureuse et pleine de découverte avec des objets d'artes, des peintures et de magnifique photo a découvrir dans toutes les pièces !

Near the house you can find supermarkets, restaurants and more.The room is very clean, well decorated, spacious and the bathroom too.
Orestes helped us a lot with advices about places and location.
We felt very comfortable at his house and we totally recommend Orestes's house to all in Airbnb.

12937,9316807,21/12/13,1787661,Benjamin,"After many guests we even had with AirBnB, that was our first time as a AirBnB guest ourselves - and it was a really great experience. The room and the house of Orestes are exactly as shown at the pics. It´s a great renovated townhouse, perfect located in Queens - Long Island City, just two metro-stations away from Times Square. 
In contrast to have the stay in Manhattan it is very quiet and relaxful there. The Metro is just 2 minutes to walk and after a few minutes more you are in midtown manhatten. Perfect!

The bedroom is very cozy and the own bathroom - with the biggest shower we´ve ever seen - is awesome and very clean too.

Orestes is a perfect host. He is very friendly, helpful and has many inside tips to get to know the ""Capital of the World"".

For every New York-Visitor we just can recommend Orestes and his great location and would love to come back. Thanks a lot and all the best!"
12937,10117922,1/2/14,9767806,Asa,Orestes’ place is very unique designed and decorated. His space is filled with the sense of art.Orestes is very knowledgeable and also warmhearted.Highly recommend!!
12937,10762621,6/3/14,7697528,Lindy,"We loved staying at the Private Suite in Long Island City. The bedroom and bathroom were both nicely decorated, spacious and functional. I can imagine in Spring or Summer we would have relaxed and enjoyed the weather in the beautiful landscaped garden. It's just one stop from midtown Manhatten, so you do have all the advantages of being close to the city. We also enjoyed walking along the shore with the Manhattan Midtown skyline view and taking the ferry. We can certainly recommend Orestes' Private Suite!  "
12937,11320502,30/3/14,11022006,Patricia,"We stayed at Orestes' place 4 nights at the end of March and we're very happy that we've chosen to stay with him. The location is ideal: a couple of minutes from the nearest Subway station (which takes you in a couple more minutes across the water) and very quiet. You also have a lot of space: large bedroom and a bathroom with a huge shower. Unfortunately, it was too cold to sit in the garden but it looked lovely from the outside!
Orestes himself was very friendly and always happy to help us out with suggestions or advice.
If you're happy with staying outside of the city center, I would definitely recommend Orestes' place!"
12937,11447832,3/4/14,5397841,Anneleen,"Gorgeous house, lovely room, amazing shower, friendly host and very practical location! It's only one easy subway stop from manhattan and it's situated in a lovely neighborhood. As an added bonus, the Chrysler building pops up in the view down the street. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you, Orestes!  "
12937,11826054,16/4/14,11067808,Stephan,"Our stay was great, the room is very nice, the shower is incredible, and the location is amazing : quiet, very close to Manhattan : different subway lines around the corner giving you very quick access to all of Manhattan, the view a few streets down is incredible : skyline at night a must see. Enough restaurants around the neighbourhood, to have a good choice, as well as quiet a few bars also.

For those on a budget there is a grocery store a quick walk away called the food cellar, you can eat pretty good hot food at a bargain.

Orestes is a very nice person helpful, quiet and kind.

I hope we will go back to New York one day with our children, it will be hard to find a place as good for the four of us.

To resume if you are looking for a place close to the action in a quiet area THIS IS THE PLACE!!!!!!!!"
12937,12146772,24/4/14,11628610,Patrice,"Notre séjour à New York a été rendu très agréable par l'accueil et le logement d'Orestes. L'habitation est très confortable et très accueillante au sein d'une maison aménagée avec beaucoup de charme. Orestes est quelqu'un de discret et disponible. C'est de plus très bien situé, tout proche d'une station de métro pour se rendre à Manhattan (une station plus loin) . Il y a des boutiques juste à coté , et un excellent ""Diner"" typique pour se restaurer.Nous en avons bien profité.

The place was neat and comfortable, the garden just wonderful, a cafe there among the trees and beautiful flowers made us happy.
It is close to two metro stations with eating places and with subway Manhattan was really just couple of minutes.
All in all it was a excellent choice.
Thank you Orestes"
12937,13404322,27/5/14,4851050,Sanneke,"Our first trip to New York couldn't have been better. This was mainly due to the wonderfull place of Orestes. The facade of the building is really as lovely as on the picture, the bathroom even better. The bedroom offers enough space for all your stuff. Orestes helps you if you want. And if you'd prefer more privacy, that is also good. One of the best assets of this place is the location. Within a couple of stops you can get anywhere - from Manhattan to Brooklyn and Williamsburg. Stock up at one of the supermarkets close by and take the train to one of the best cities we've been to. An absolute recommendation!"
12937,14740877,25/6/14,7117301,Marta,"The house is absolutely amazing, but the most amazing thing is how warm, nice and helpful were Orestes, Chris and Delilah. Highly recommended. We'd love to stay back with you, guys :) Thanks!!! Give some hugs to Kiki from us!!!"

Even though he wasn't around for 3/4 of our stay, he made sure everything was in place for us and made us feel at home.  He was also kind enough to share his dog Kiki, his study and workspace with us.  

The listing was as we expexted. The bedroom was spacious even though we had 3 pieces of luggage. The shower cubicle and bathroom was really nice and a good size.  

Orestes' s home is set in a pretty tree lined street.  It is in a very convenient location.  Going uptown or downtown in NYC was easily accessible by taxi or the subway.  The train lines no.7 or E and M pretty much covers access to most parts of NYC"

Das Haus hat Stil und ist liegt in einem ruhigen Viertel. Das Zimmer ist für 2 Personen komfortabel und ruhig, das Badezimmer sehr schön und modern mit sehr großer Dusche.
La maison à du style et se trouve dans un quartier tranquille. La chambre est pour 2 personnes confortable et tranquille, la salle de bain est belle et moderne avec une très grande douche.
Orestes ist sehr angenehm und freundlich, diskret aber immer bereit, jede Frage zu beantworten. Hat uns einen sehr guten Tipp fürs Abendessen in „seinem“ Viertel gegeben: LIC (Long Island City) Market. Sehr gute Küche, nette Atmosphäre, freundliche Leute.
Orestes est très agréable et gentil, discret mais toujours prêt à répondre à nos questions. Il nous a donné une bonne adresse dans son quartier pour le repas du soir à quelques pas de chez lui » LIC-Market » : très bonne cuisine, bonne atmosphère et  accueil chaleureux.
Mit der U-Bahn sind wenig Schritte vom Haus vom Haus entfernt und ein paar Stationen weiter ist man bereits in Manhattan. Wirklich ideal !
Avec le métro à quelques pas vous vous retrouver au cœur de Manhattan en quelques minutes. Vraiment idéal !
Als Gartenfreund möchte ich noch erwähnen, dass Orestes einen wunderschönen großen Garten im Hinterhof hat.
Je ne voudrai pas manquer de signaler le très beau jardin d’Orestes.
Vielen herzlichen Dank - Un grand merci - Thank you very much Orestes.

La proximité de l'East River est également un plus, en 5/10mn, vous êtes dans un ""park"" avec des bancs, chaises longues au bord de l'eau avec en vue le siège de l'Onu et une jolie skyline
Quand à Orestes, c'est vraiment un cœur, j'ai été malade (chaud/froid du métro et air conditionné) et il m'a préparé la recette spéciale de sa grand-mère, m'a fait de la soupe etc, vraiment agréable
Son ami et lui sont des personnes sympathiques, cultivées et intéressantes

My stay at Orestes home was more than pleasant: the room is big, with a sofa, a small and very practical refrigerator, a magnificent bathroom with an immense Italian-style shower, the subway is in 3mn with 4 lines, a dinner, a small supermarket, and other to have lunch, have dinner or have brunch, a calm borough near many spots, the house has also a very beautiful design and a beautiful and big garden
The closeness of East River is also one + there 5 / 10mn, you are in a ""park"" with benches, deckchairs at the water's edge with in sight of United Nations, and an attractive skyline
And Orestes, it is really a seweet heart, I was sick (warmly / cold of the subway and the air-conditioning) and he prepared to me the special recipe of his grandmother, made me some soup etc., really pleasant
Him and his partner are very nice, cultivated and interesting people

Orestes honestly and accurately depicts his lovely space on the site, and his attention to detail ensures you'll have a comfortable experience. Spotlessly clean, convenient to transportation, safe, quiet, affordable, tastefully decorated. Plus a must-see-to-believe backyard paradise; you'll forget that you're in NYC. I'm almost hesitant to praise it too much more for fear that it will be so booked in the future that I may not be able to get in! Orestes is a kind, creative and welcoming host whose hospitality left me feeling like a friend more than a guest. I hope to return soon! ¡Muchisimas gracias Orestes!"

His dog Kiki is a sweet ambassador for the place. I loved everything about this stay (except that it was too brief) and hope to return again."

12937,21675721,21/10/14,3836330,Alicia,"Pros:
- Orestes is a great host, friendly & approachable, I asked to print some stuffs and he kindly let me use his printer. He even gave us postcards featuring his house as a souvenir.
- beautiful house with a lovely garden, conveniently located within minutes walk to the subway station, in a quiet neighborhood, with supermarket and cafes just round the corner.
- The private room that we stayed is very nicely decorated and has everything from a microwave, to a fridge with plates/cups/utensils all provided in the room, making it really convenient as you don't have to go all the way to the kitchen. Room is big & spacious, with a sofa, table & chairs. 
Cons:
- the exit of the subway station leading to the house only has stairs and no escalator/elevator. Hence if you have big/heavy luggages, it's quite a bit of work to carry them up & down. of course you can use other exits but they are further away.
-  the ""ensuite"" bathroom is not really adjoined to the bedroom, it is the next room beside the bedroom and you have to walk down the hallway to get to it. of course it is still privately yours and is a really cool bathroom equipped with different shower heads.
- Unlike some hosts who left keys for you in some secret place so that you can let yourself into the house anytime you arrive, Orestes does not do that and we waited a while for him out in the cold when we arrived close to midnight. of course I communicated my arrival time to him but he was out having dinner and missed the timing. well, I guess this is all part & parcel of the little hiccups of travelling.

The room is spacious, with everything I needed (and more), and the bathroom is luxurious and beautifully designed.  The back garden is a green oasis and was so pleasant to sit in after a long day.
Orestes was a gracious host, meeting me late on the first night and even buying some essentials to put in the fridge for me.  He was friendly, warm and helpful without being intrusive.  
Many reasons that I will go back to Orestes' place again!"

Good sized, comfortable bed, TV in the room, a sofa and a small fridge. Bathroom was awesome. Large shower area. 

This airbnb is less than 5 minutes to a subway stop that takes you right into Manhattan. Also just as close to a grocery store and several restaurants many of which are the fine dining type.

Orestes was there to greet us when we arrived, and gave us a short tour of the place. He was very helpful in providing advice on things to do, and was very easy to chat to, but also gave you the right amount of space. The bedroom was very spacious, and we absolutely loved having breakfast outside in the garden every morning. We bought supplies to make breakfasts and lunches. There were no formal cooking facilities, but we didn't expect there to be and we definitely didn't need them - the bar fridge, microwave and kettle in our room were more than enough for us. We just washed our dishes in the bathroom. The bathroom was lovely! We had use of a guest computer and printer, which was really handy for sorting through photos and printing out tickets, etc. Orestes had to fly out half way through our stay, but Gabriella stayed to house-sit, and she was just as friendly and great to chat with! We loved Orestes' dog, Kiki, as well. It was a great base to come back to after a full day of exploring - it was quiet, safe and extremely close to the subway. There was also a diner round the corner that provided a quick and cheap dinner when needed.

The apartment also features a great outdoors terrace that Orestes is kind enough to allow access, and while he wasn't around during our stay, our host Gabriela was very welcoming and made sure our stay was comfortable and allowed for our privacy.

The location is excellent, only one stop away from Manhattan with the subway station around the block. The area itself boasts a number of attractions and a few good restaurants.

This will definitely be our preferred place to stay whenever we visit NYC."
12937,40903128,3/8/15,32611886,Simone,"Orestes' Unterkunft war super! Besser hätten wir es in NYC nicht treffen können!
Das Zimmer war sauber, groß und hatte Extras wie einen kleinen Kühlschrank und eine Mikrowelle! Noch besser als das Schlafzimmer war das Bad! Alles sehr sauber, einfach zum Wohlfühlen! 
Der Garten hinter Orestes Haus war toll, um zu frühstücken oder einfach nur zu sitzen und die Stille zu genießen!
Die Lage der Unterkunft ist sehr zentral, nur wenige Schritten von der nächsten Subway entfernt! Diner und Supermarkt sind ebenfalls um die Ecke! 
Da Orestes in der Zeit, in der wir gebucht hatten, nicht zuhause war, empfing uns Gaby, die Housekeeperin! Gaby war wunderbar! Sie hat uns freundlichst empfangen, uns die Räume gezeigt und uns ein paar Insider Tips gegeben. Danke nochmal Gaby :))

Wir würden auf jeden Fall wieder kommen! "
12937,41306120,7/8/15,4586021,Gareth,Great location close to sculpture centre and moma/ps1 restaurants and the gorgeous waterfront overlooking Manhattan which is only one subway stop away. Quiet room in a lovely brownstone street and an architect designed shower I could live with forever. My family of  four fitted and our host was a pleasure. We love the local diner but all kinds of dining a stroll away.  Long Island City is a great location from which to enjoy New York.
12937,43352585,19/8/15,30096334,Faust,"Overall , it was an amazing experience , being first time in New York with my daughter.  The hosts , Oreste and Gabriela did all they could, so we really felt at home and safe. The description of the house was exactly as in the web site... the room was spacious, very clean and also the bathroom was itself  a dream. Very quiet area, and do not forget the private garden, a beautiful spot to drink your coffee.  Strongly recommended.  Definitely the place to return on our next trip to New York. Thanks , Carmen & Oana
"
12937,44283056,25/8/15,13454947,Michael,"A great place, a haven of peace, very well situated, quiet but yet two stops from the main attractions in Midtown Manhattan. You can hardly imagine the fantastic garden in the back, whre we could relax at night after the hustle and bustle in the big city. We didn't meet Orestes - wich was sad - but his very nice friend Gabriela looked after us and N.Y. without her would only has been half as good.

12937,45363043,2/9/15,28367433,Ken,"My wife and I spent 5 days recently at Orestes place and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The temperatures in New York were in the 90's the whole time, so the air condition suite was really appreciated.  Orestes was a very helpful and accommodating host and helped us out with our daily touring/planning.  The bedroom unit has all the amenities one would need, assuming you are there to see New York, and not simply stay in the bedroom. The location of this residence is so perfect, on a quite tree lined street, but yet a few minutes walk to the major subway lines, restaurants, convenience stores, and water front.  I am a Landscape Architect and Oreste has done a wonderful job with his rear yard/garden oasis, and it was so nice to sit in the heavily landscape yard in the morning, and one would never know they were so close to Manhattan.  We would certainly look at booking with Orestes next time we need accommodation in New York."
12937,46120561,8/9/15,7579684,Tina,"Orestes was a great host. He was helpful with any questions and recommendations. The home is exactly as described. Beautiful, clean, and extremely convenient to the City. Only one stop away! I fully recommend his place for a NY visit, and will be staying there again on my next visit!"
12937,48371308,26/9/15,25757106,Rosanna,"A few days @ Home and i want to go back again already.  Back to NY, but also back to Orestes!! A perfectly furnished apartment, cozy and warm. The apartment is suberbly located richt next to the metrostation which takes you in no time in the center of Manhattan. 
Orestes knots mand Nice spots in NY city and tells you About iT if you want. IT was our first time we have booked trough Airbnb, a fantastic experience also by the enthusiasm by Orestes, huis partner an not to mention the sweet old lady Kiki (sweet dog)! Privacy in this apartment guaranteed!!!

NY is one of the best things ever happened to me. I hope to come back to NY and ofcourse with Orestes"
12937,48982857,30/9/15,13994090,Amanda,"Staying here was a wonderful experience, not only is the place better than in the pictures and perfectly located, but Orestes was an amazing host, extremely nice and made us feel at home. Would definitely recommend staying here if you can, you will not regret it."
12937,49340350,3/10/15,10827449,Megan,"Orestes took great care of my mom and sister. They really enjoyed their stay, and were very grateful for all the hospitality and suggestions that Orestes provided. Would definitely recommend!"
12937,50068291,9/10/15,37286668,Joan,"We so enjoyed our stay at Orestes lovely home.  The bedroom was spacious and very comfortable and included a TV, mini fridge, microwave and coffee machine.  Orestes' garden was an oasis where we could sit and enjoy our breakfast before setting out for the day.  
The location is excellent for access to the subway with trains taking us all the way into Manhatten.
Orestes is a  gracious host, and made us feel very welcome. 
If we should ever return to New York, we would definitely book with Orestes."
12937,50616131,13/10/15,5960430,Eberle,"We just wish we could have stayed longer.  Orestes has done an amazing job of rehabilitating an historic row house and it was so great as a guest to get to feel part of the neighborhood for a brief stay. Access to the subway is from all directions, a block or less away. It was so nice to come back to the quiet green street after being in the hubbub of Manhattan.  Hope to be back there next year or sooner! "
12937,53450129,9/11/15,34987729,Jose Carlos,"Orestes and Cristian were great hosts, they made sure we had everything we need for a pleasant stay. 

The place is great. Excellent location, really near the subway, safe neighborhood and a lot of facilities near the house.

I hope I can come back some day."
12937,54094662,16/11/15,25038722,Christine,"This was the second time I've stayed at Orestes' place and once again it was absolutely great. The house is beautifully decorated and just one block away from 3 major subway lines. Our room was spotless. There are great little cafes and restaurants in walking distance, too. Orestes is a wonderful host, always very welcoming and helpful. It felt like staying with a friend. I can only highly recommend his place. "
12937,54968950,27/11/15,14188517,Ruth,"Great place to stay on the outskirts of the city. Away from the crazy hubbub of Manhatten but close enough to be handy to everywhere. Interesting and lovely people, a really special house and very knowledgeable host!"

Orestes is a great host. Kind and with good suggestions for dining out in the local neighbourhood. We will definately come back to stay at Orestes place :-)"
12937,56236868,11/12/15,25335302,Louise,"My mom and I stayed 1 week at Orestes´ place and we loved it! Orestes is a great host - he gives you your privacy, but is always there to answer any question you may have.
The room is very nice and cozy. Comfortable beds!
The neighborhood felt save and only a short walk from the water where I went running alone in the morning. It is so much more quit than down-/uptown New York which we really appreciated. 
There is a lot of nice places to eat and the supermarked is right around the corner.
The metro/train is only 5 minutes away and runs all the time.

I/we have only positive things to say about Orestes and his place, and I/we highly recommend other people to stay there if they want to visit New York City. 
If I/we am/are going to New York again, I/we hope that Orestes has room for us :)

12937,59631056,13/1/16,3399465,Juan,"Amazing place, excelent location , and perfect owner . What else to say but a place that will boost you NYC experience!!!! Hghly recommended !!!"
12937,61482381,5/2/16,50146222,Sarah," Orestes is a lovely gentleman, a wonderful neighbor and a vibrant businessman and artist. All of these components make him the perfect host for AirBnB. He is welcoming with genuine warmth and full details about the private room he rents and also the neighborhood, and he goes above and beyond in terms of taking care of his guests."
12937,62373531,14/2/16,1985365,Keith,"Orestes was very welcoming and helpful.  I neglected to let him know that we were arriving later than he expected.  He had to go out, but he left a key in a convenient location and made sure we had no difficulties getting in.  The bedroom is comfortable and location is indeed convenient.  For those addicted to connectivity, the wifi is a bit intermittent."
12937,64095019,29/2/16,55287620,Paul,"Orestes and Chris were very welcoming; their artwork adds to the ambiance. While it was too cool to use the garden, this would be ideal in the summer. The room is quite comfortable and quiet, in a very convenient location, with good restaurants nearby. The wifi worked fine. We would definitely stay there again."
12937,66504992,22/3/16,8385142,Rowena,"Orestes was a great host: he kept in contact and gave loads of fantastic tips for food and stuff to do. We loved the ferry ride he recommended from Gantry Plaza Park - what a great way to get to Manhattan! 

The house and neighborhood are lovely. Long Island City has loads of great restaurants and cafes, and we especially enjoyed brunch at LIC Market (another recommendation from Orestes!). The house is minutes from the metro, and from there it is super easy to get to Manhattan (one stop to Mid Town). An ideal location, really. 

"
12937,68708800,6/4/16,6624591,Sylvie,"Our stay in Oreste's house was a perfekt experience ! It was very comfortable, clean and very quiet (we could sleep with our window open in the center of NY and be woken up by the birds in the morning !)
It's very close from two subways main lines. It's very convenient after a long day in the city.
There are many places to eat in the neighborhood with a variety of food from all over the world.
Oreste is a very nice guy, he took time to explain us how the best way to walk around in the city and the good places to go. Unfortunately, he had to travel and we didn't see him again. But his companion Christian was there and he was as kind as Oreste. He was always ready to answer when we had a question.
We lowe this place and hope we could come again. We sincerely recommend this house if you like comfort and a nice place !
Thanks you so much Oreste and Christian for your nice and kind welcome !
Sylvie and Francine, Geneva"
12937,69215706,10/4/16,45472139,Derrick,"This was our first Airbnb experience and Orestes and Chris made it an extremely positive and memorable trip! They were easy to work with on both check-in and check-out times, even when our flight in ended up being delayed several hours. Everything matched the online description and the location couldn't have been more convenient for travel on the Subway system into Manhattan. Orestes was very helpful when it came to questions about transportation and the city itself. We highly recommend staying here on your next visit to NYC! "
12937,71351458,24/4/16,26704905,Quentin,"Wonderful stay. Great hosts and amazing location. Very practical with the E and 7 lines. Quiet area, birds chirping in the morning, nice room and bathroom, exactly as describe in the listing. Highly recommended."
12937,72781452,4/5/16,55294262,Deb,"The location was great, safe and close to 2 subway stations. We had difficulty contacting our host pre visit which we found very distressing but realised afterwards that he had some emergency.  The shower is wonderful but be aware that it is not ensuite! I would definitely recommend this property."
12937,75423363,21/5/16,5296568,Ute,"What an amazing place to stay! A nice and cozy private room, a terrific bathroom, beautiful artwork! But what counts even more is the host’s warmth and welcoming nature. Highly recommendable, I’ld definitely stay there again!"
12937,76833423,29/5/16,57379443,Marlise,"Wir fühlten uns in unserer Unterkunft sehr gut aufgehoben. Orestes war ein aufmerksamer Gastgeber, ohne aufdringlich zu sein. Das originelle, gut gepflegte  Haus liegt in einer ruhigen Gegend. U-Bahnstationen der Linien E und 7 liegen ein paar Schritte entfernt und man ist in 1 Station mitten in Manhatten. Das Zimmer ist zweckmässig eingerichtet. Wir durften unser Frühstück in dem wunderbaren romantischen Garten einnehmen. Ein Highlight!
Kurz zusammengefasst: Die Unterkunft können wir wärmstens empfehlen und würden bei einem nächsten Aufenhalt in NY sofort wieder dort buchen."
12937,77515958,1/6/16,989701,Diane,"Thank you so much for the wonderful hospitality, Orestes... our stay couldn't have been made better! Our room was very comfortable, quiet and very private. We loved having breakfast in your lovely garden oasis. We got to really appreciate the neighbourhood and easy access to the subway system. I would gladly return! :-)"
12937,78698379,8/6/16,56589187,Malisa,"Fantastic stay! The location as perfect, very close the the subway. The property itself was lovely, we specially liked the bathroom, very spacious. Orestes is a lovely host, he was always there if we needed any help at the same time maintaining our privacy. If we visit NY again, we will definitely stay here."

12937,80478926,18/6/16,3591852,Shirley,"Orestes, Thanks for being our consummate host ! 
Allister, Brandon (our 20mth old) and I stayed with Orestes at his gorgeous townhome on a quaint tree lined street.  We come to NY often but this was the first time we decided not to stay at a boring hotel in Manhattan and we're so glad we picked to stay at Orestes!  The place is just lovely, and the neighbour (that we met) was great.  Very secure home and in a safe neighborhood if you are worried or new to the Airbnb experience.  Orestes had great recommendations if you want to explore Queens or head into Manhattan.  The home is as described but better, you have full privacy in the spacious room and large bathroom, clean, and very convenient access on the E and 7 lines (only a 2-3 minute walk).  Besides the art and decor of the place, the other highlight is the beautiful garden in the back of the home.  A garden paradise away from the hustle and bustle of the city, we loved kicking back and enjoying our breakfast in the garden.   If you share a love of photography, art and travel/culture, you will enjoy your stay with Orestes’s as we have.  Definitely would love to stay at Orestes’s again, and would recommend to our friends and other Airbnb members. "

12937,83273048,2/7/16,23605376,Jasmin,"Nice room in a beatiful house! It is a quiet, safe neighbourhood, with restaurants and shops nearby. Manhattan can be reached in minutes using the Metro. Two stations are located close by. Orestes and Cristian are perfect hosts, being there when you need them yet still allowing for privacy. We were allowed to use the washer/dryer and besides the intermittent wifi-connection, everything was fine. Kiki is a delight for every dog lover and for early risers the garden is an oasis of peace. Thank you very much!"
12937,85025654,10/7/16,1637872,Karl,"We enjoyed the stay a lot. Orestes and Chris are really nice guys and help with info wherever they can. Several train and metrolines are just around the corner so it is very easy to go to manhattan or to discover queens, williamsburgh, brooklyn ..... The house is perfectly renovated and the room with seperate bathroom is perfect for recovering from intense city tours. Around the corner are restaurants and bars but you have to know a bit where to look for it ( try court sqare diner, john brown bbq, also a nice thai at court square)"
12937,85978674,14/7/16,73361335,Sheelagh,"Orestes was welcoming and a good host.  We were very grateful for the phone calls that he made on our behalf to sort out some coach tickets and he suggested places of interest to visit. 

The room is large and comfortable with a microwave and cups for that all-important cup of home-made tea or coffee. The bathroom is next door to the bedroom and the shower lived up to the expectations that we had read about in previous reviews!

This is a great location, very close to the subway and only a few stops from the heart of Manhattan. The neighbourhood feels like a safe, quiet residential area with a good selection of cafes and diners which are cheaper than the city centre. This was a secure and friendly base from which we enjoyed a great time in New York. 

Thank you, Orestes!

The room and bathroom are spacious, clean and decorated to a very high standard.  Orestes has loads of local knowledge and was a great help to us. The apartment is in a fantastic location. The metro is a 5 min walk and we felt very safe. You can also get a really good view of Manhattan from GantryPlaza which is only 20 mins away on foot. Here you can also get a boat down the river. Another great tip from Orestes. 

Thank you Orestes! Hopefully be back in NYC in the future!   "
12937,96753686,24/8/16,70273280,Julie,"Orestes was very friendly, communicative, and gracious before and during our stay. Upon arrival, he gave us a nice quick tour and we got to meet Kiki the lovely dog. His place was very clean and quaint, just as described. His backyard was especially beautiful - too bad we did not get to utilize it since we were out exploring most of the days. In fact the entire block is just beautiful to walk down.

Overall our stay with Orestes was very pleasant. We'd stay here again if we visited."
12937,98069186,29/8/16,83154459,Devin,"You're paying for location. The place is very nice but if you're in the city exploring you will not care so much about how nice the place is.  If you plan to have any guests at all this is not the place.  For not that much more you can get a hotel in the city which could be a better option for you depending on your needs.  

But Queens is an amazing place and a very nice place to stay.  We were able to walk to all kinds of food, bars, and the beautiful park on the water where you can see the whole city skyline.  The ""private entrance, private room, dedicated bathroom"" are all right outside of the hosts home office which he will be in constantly, which is fine but the wording of his description put a larger emphasis on privacy so I guess expected more.

Over all, this place is very nice but if I had to do it again I would strongly consider going to a hotel for a little more per day or gone to a cheaper Airbnb.

Nous revenons ravis de notre séjour à Long Island City à 5 minutes de Manhattan.
Tout nous a séduit :

La maison se situe dans une rue type West Village mais en mieux, puisque nous avons été surpris en arrivant d’entendre chanter les oiseaux dans les arbres. Avons succombé au charme du jardin d’Orestes. Maison aménagée avec goût, très inspirante.
La situation extrêmement près du métro lignes (E/M) ou (7/G). on peut facilement aller à l’aéroport mais aussi en plein Manhattan plus vite que si on y était ! 
La vue sur Manhattan superbe le long de la East River. Bateau one stop to Manhattan et possibilité de joindre le Williamsburg et wall street aussi
Les bons restaurant alentours (Bia, LIC Market, Court square ouvert 24H/24) 
Le quartier riche en musées contemporains et street art (près des studios de cinéma)

Mais surtout l’accueil et la personnalité de notre hôte Orestes. En effet sa gentillesse, disponibilité  a fait de ce séjour un moment unique. Nous avons pu notamment partager notre  passion pour le jardin et l’art. Bref tout était parfait !

Thanks again Orestes for receiving us. We look forward to seeing you again.

12937,154408266,24/5/17,106957403,Amanda,"Fantastic space to stay in. Orestes made us feel very welcome. The listing is absolutely perfect for getting anywhere in Manhattan. There is a Metro station right around the corner. Very convenient.

The neighborhood was also quiet and felt safe. Thank you for hosting us!"
12937,156053906,29/5/17,82786216,Claus,"We had a fantastic stay at Orestes and Christian’s house. They are amazing.
And Orestes description (and pictures) of the room, the house, the area and the direction from JFK was exactly right.
They were both very helpful with hints on restaurants, sightseeing etc.
Thank you for opening your home to us – hope you will let us come back. All the best to you and Kiki."
12937,157729372,4/6/17,61166853,Laurence,Orestes' place in LIC is very well located and charming. The room is very big and the bathroom is newly renovated. The private entrance into their home makes it easy access in and out. We definitely recommend it!
12937,160004352,12/6/17,115919014,Geert,Great hosts and a wonderfull placefrom which to explore the City. Close to Metro and in no-time in Manhattan. I would reccomend it highly to friends and family.
12937,162102545,19/6/17,120861823,Vincent,"We spent 4 amazing in NYC and we really appreciated the Orestes house. Beautiful and typical house. The little garden is lovely and very useful for an outdoor breakfast (except some hungry mosquitos...). The position of this B&B is quite perfect (2 min from the subway Line E so 5 min from Manhattan) and finally Orestes is a very sympatical host, always available. Thanks, hope to come back again."
12937,162787808,22/6/17,13994090,Amanda,"We looooove staying at Orestes', this is our second time and it was just as great as the first but with the bonus that we already knew Orestes was an amazing host so it was all easy peasy. Room is just as pictured, huge, clean, bathroom is amazing and you can't beat the location. 

Hope you are well Orestes, Juan says hi and we'll see you again soon! "
12937,165018018,30/6/17,1596164,Erin,As advertised.  Lovely street.  Subway access to Manhattan is excellent.  We really only slept there which it was perfect suited for.  Accommodating and friendly hosts.  Thanks!

12937,170477449,15/7/17,131777676,Alberto,"Excelente ubicación de la casa, la atención de Orestes es excelente y hay un buen jardin disponible para los huespedes. Transporte publico a solo 1 cuadra. En fin muy recomendable."
12937,173104114,22/7/17,8977429,Mano,"Orestes's place was great, the best we've been to so far. 

It's just like the pictures: pretty, spacious and clean. He made us feel at home right away and gave us some good tips to eat and go to. If you need him, he's always available.

The location is great as well. The subway is literately around the corner and not far from Manhattan.

We really recommend this place!"
12937,175656320,29/7/17,18700088,Delphine,"We really loved our stay at Orestes's. The bedroom and the bathroom were both really large and confortable. The house was very tastefully decorated, and really close to the subway. Orestes is very welcoming and kindly answered to all our questions. We will definitely come back! Thank you! "
12937,179382001,7/8/17,113488673,Nicole,"Orestes was an excellent host. The room was large and comfortable, the bathroom was lovely and everything was clean. 

The location was fantastic, it was so quick and easy to get everywhere we wanted to on the subway which is right around the corner. 

We had a great stay and would definitely recommend staying here."
12937,184400585,19/8/17,50356395,Giulia,"The house is just few stops out of Manhattan, in a residential area, with the chance to take several subway lines to reach different points of the city easily. The room is comfortable, as the bathroom too: it would have been great to have the access to the bathroom straight from the bedroom, because you need to walk through the entrance to the working studio, but Orestes has been always very nice and left us our privacy and spaces. He is a great host, very precise and available to give tips and indications. Next to the house there is a supermarket, an American diner, Coffee shops, there is everything you could need during a vacation.  
It's a good solution for people visiting NYC and not spending lot of time inside the house and for who likes to live more as a resident than as a tourist."
12937,186843074,25/8/17,43850168,Henrik Pedersen,"We had six fantastic days in Orestes charming house and with Orestes as the perfect host. 
Nice, friendly, many good advices, as walking tours, what to see, where to eat etc. Nice to stay in a part of NY, where people lives. In addition, easy to take the subway to Manhattan, being in the center of this interesting town – and nice to come back in the evenings in a quiet atmosphere.
Al the best recommendations to the place, and Orestes!

12937,188810678,30/8/17,64711255,Miki,We had very comfortable and convenient stay!! Thank you so much!
12937,193142264,12/9/17,22875194,Donnal,"Great location, so close to Manhattan. Room is spacious and very comfortable. The shower is phenomenal - multiple heads and a steam function. Cris was lovely and very helpful. We highly recommend Orestes' home and would return."
12937,195500785,19/9/17,71139528,Ernesto,"This places is amazing, located in a very convenient and safe area. The hosts are very friendly and always willing to help!"
12937,196281194,22/9/17,96595581,Daniel And Amber,"We stayed for three nights. As first time travelers to NYC, we wanted to be close to or in Manhattan. We chose this property because it was close to the city but allowed us to escape the hustle and bustle. The property is only a minute walk from Courts Square metro and the subway goes directly into Manhattan. 15 minutes and you're in Times Square. It is quick, cheap (about $2.50 one-way) and convenient. An Uber or taxi from Downtown is about $30. The neighborhood itself is quintessential gritty Queens but did not appear dangerous and the street itself is beautiful and quite. 
The room exceeded our expectations. We thought it would be a small space, but it was the size of a standard hotel room. It was clean. It has a mini fridge, microwave, couch, double bed and air conditioning. The bed was soft and the room was quiet. The bathroom was fantastic. A proper bathroom with big shower, plenty of hot water - plus a sauna feature. 
Both Orestes and Cris were wonderful hosts. They were accommodating to our requests and were very welcoming with their home. They lived upstairs, allowing for privacy as well as access to free wifi and most of the whole bottom floor. We were also offered full use of the courtyard at the back, which would be perfect for breakfast in the sunshine or to read a book. 
This place is a definite gem and we would highly recommend staying here again.  Thank you again, Orestes and Cris for your kind hospitality."
12937,198721826,30/9/17,21031596,Anthony,"Merci à Orestes et Christian pour leurs explications, précisions et propositions de visites, notamment une entre Le Queen's et Brooklyn fort sympathique!
Ils sont disponibles et très accueillants. 
Le calme de la maison est salutaire après les journées de visites entre-autres dans la fougue de Manhattan!
Nous avons pu profiter du joli jardin pour les petits-déjeuner et ce fut bien agréable! La maison est très jolie et rapide d'accès pour Manhattan! On vous le conseille vivement. A&C"
12937,201614616,8/10/17,92186853,Fiona,"Orestes's place is great!!! Location, get around is easy, love the LIC market Orestes recommended. Had brunch there twice! I definitely recommend you to live here! Its truly a good experience and I can't ask for more!"
12937,202961843,13/10/17,129766936,Shannon,The listing made it sound like it was a private room on the lower level of their home that they do not use. It said private door entrance which I believed would be our own and we would have a room in a location they never came to. The room is next to their office space and they were there quite often playing music and working. The entrance was the one they used and was not private. I feel they made it seem quite different in the description. They also have no instruction about checking out and so we just left in the morning to catch our flight and then he sent me kind of a rude sounding message saying that wasn’t the right thing to do and he deserved an explanation. It did not meet expectations at all.
12937,205513042,22/10/17,18792040,Thomas & Erik,"Orestes and Christian are welcoming og positive hosts. 
Close to the subway, big room with private big bathroom. 
Refrigirator and microwaveoven in the room. 
Quiet and safe neighbourhood. 
TIP:  use the Citibikes to go round New York. You see a lot more this way."
12937,206929420,27/10/17,138264465,Joshua,Great place for people looking to experience New York City. It’s close to Manhattan while also being a quieter neighborhood. Orestes is an excellent host and had many great recommendations for places to eat and sights to see. Definitely would come here again.
12937,214833876,26/11/17,89681689,Roy,"Orestes's place is really convenient for anyone visiting NYC. Close to a transport hub and walkable it's a great jumping off point regardless of your plans. Orestes is also a fantastic host with a wealth of information about his city. We had an amazing trip, improved by having an amazing place to stay."
12937,215765543,1/12/17,71095066,Chris,"I loved staying with Orestes. The location was unbelievable, and on a block I always wanted to live on (looks like something straight out of Sesame Street). Super close to the trains. I made it to the center of Grand Central in 12 minutes. Highly recommend! And Orestes is a wonderful artist as well... I would have loved to see more of his work. Maybe next time..."
12937,216540050,4/12/17,115959242,Anita,"Orestes was an amazing host. He went above and beyond to share local knowledge on everything from trains and best places to eat. The location is superb, literally a 2min walk to the subway which takes u directly into Grand Central/Times sq and one arrives every 5mins. If we were to do this trip again we would definitely stay here. The accommodation is fantastic, quirky décor which we loved, comfy bed and an amazing shower. Thanks a million."

Location is perfect. 1 minute walking from the metro and 10 minutes from Times Square with the metro. 

He is happy to give you al the information you need as well as more then enough privacy to get your rest. 

It has been a great experience, both the city as the accommodation. 

Kind regards,

12937,266856550,20/5/18,158917794,Gustavo,"The location is on a historic classic block in Queens. The subway is around the corner. Manhattan is just minutes away. The Court Square Dinner around the corner serves great food, big servings at great prices. The Thai place next to the doughnut place is good to. There are several quality dinners within a couple of blocks. It is a much greater value to dine in Queens than Manhattan. At Time Square around Broadway and 48th we ate often at TSQ. Awesome ,delicious big servings. Strong Long Island Ice Tea for just 12 bucks.
 Can't wait to comeback!"

12937,273842305,7/6/18,52654223,Eleonor,"Nous avons séjourné 10 jours chez Orestes et c’était parfait. 
L’accueil s’est fait en présence de l’hôte. Nous avions pu communiquer facilement avant notre arrivée sur les lieux pour fixer quelques détails. 
Ensuite tout au long du séjour Orestes a été très disponible pour nous, il nous a donné quelques conseil sur notre séjour et ce que nous devions absolument faire. 
Même si nous sommes dans une maison habitée la chambre est isolée et avec sa propre entrée donc c’est paisible. Hyper bien desservie en termes de transports avec 3 lignes de métro à 5 min à pied de la chambre. Une vue magnifique sur Manhattan et l’East River à 10 min à pied. Idéale au coucher du soleil :) possibilité de prendre le ferry aussi comme moyen de transport pas loin ! Bref tout les avantages de NY avec des hôtes à l’écoute mais pas envahissant :) je recommande vivement cette adresse ! "

And It was very convenient to go to Manhattan :)"
12937,294145842,21/7/18,42238262,Chantal,"Orestes's home is a great place to stay if you want to live like a local! Most would think Long Island City is too far from all the action from Manhattanx but that's not true! It's only 3 stops from Times Square,  and you avoid all the hustle and bustle. The home is a 1t minute walk to the ferries, and you will have a chance to look at the spectacular city from across the water. Mind you,  if you are not ready to socialize, this place is not for you! You will have privacy in your own space but the host does work out of the home office beside your quarters, so you might hear each other when you're both on the same floor. My husband and I were more than happy to chat with Orestes and get some local tips from him so that's a big plus. Overall, it's a great and convenient place to stay and to get an authentic New Yorker experience!"
12937,295923324,24/7/18,74885475,Mina,"Excelente anfitrión, el inmueble es muy bonito, tal y como aparece en las fotos, la ubicación excelente, sin duda una opción inmejorable para visitar NYC."

12940,21704,29/12/09,54996,Rithyka,"Had a great stay at Adreinne's! Her apartment was very nice, tidy, and less than a block from the subway. She was an awesome host, very flexible, and extremely understanding toward our odd time schedule. We felt very at home here! The neighborhood offered us a peak into the Brooklyn culture. Thank you! Would do it again!"

I had a lovely time in brooklyn thanks to her place! "
12940,251182,4/5/11,465821,Gregory,"The apartment was steps from the subway and close to many small shops for grabbing some food or groceries. We stayed here with a family of four (two university-aged students). The main (double?) bed was very comfortable, but the pull-out couch and bed-couch we less so. If you want a place out of the city but still very commutable, this worked very well."
12940,287776,30/5/11,505917,Sarah,"Thanks for a good stay, Adreinne.  The apartment is very charming and clean as well as super close to the subway.  Handling check-in and check-out was a breeze.  Everything was great!  "
12940,320811,18/6/11,633211,Courtney,"This was my first experience with airbnb, and Adreinee's Charming Brownstone was perfect for our week-long stay. Big, well decorated, full kitchen and bath, ample closet and dresser space. It's just half a block from the C-Line which takes you to Manhattan and Rockaway Beach. Most of the friends we were visiting lived within 5-10 blocks which also made the apartment super convenient, and they were all very impressed with the quality for the price. Jorge and Adreinne were both very helpful. 

The bedroom was a little noisy, facing the street, but tourist exhaustion + drink each night made that easy to deal with. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
12940,527410,13/9/11,138187,Julie,"Nice apartment, clean, easily accessible, and beautifully decorated with all the amenities we need. The only thing to note is that the location might be a little noisy for a light sleeper.

Thanks Adreinne. "
12940,654898,23/10/11,1138514,Giulio,"Adreinne's apartment in Brooklyn is perfect. It's exactly as nice as you can see in the photos... even better! Never seen Adreinne, but she gave us clear and specific instructions, and answered quickly to every questions.... The price is also very good and the location too... quiet, safe... the subway station it's around the corner... downtown Manhattan it's a 15 minutes ride... around 30 minutes to midtown and central park... I highly recommend this place! "
12940,741946,24/11/11,1201403,Jack,We all really enjoyed staying in this place. Its right across from the subway station and very easy to get around from. We never saw Adreinne but she had everything set up for us so it wasn't an issue. All in all a very nice place to stay in Brooklyn.
12940,841001,6/1/12,1173260,Nikki,"Our stay at the Brownstone went well. The place is very similar to the pictures, the subway is right across the street, and it's very spacious for two (or I imagine, even up to 4 people). 

Because the subway and bus stop are right outside the window, it is extremely loud! We turned on the fan and took some Tylenol PMs to help. If you are a light sleeper, I would not suggest this place. 

Adreinne was easy to contact through our stay when we had trouble with the heat. She was very helpful and kind. Thanks! "
12940,1127227,14/4/12,42467,Louise,"Communication from Adreinne was very good and prompt.  We were 2 adults and 2 children (one of which was a baby) and we stayed for 8 nights.  

Location
Directly opposite the subway station with a shuttle to Prospect Park is very convenient.  There wasn't much by way of places to go or hangout in the exact neighbourhood.  A few blocks down Fulton there was a place called the Outpost, and down Franklin across Fulton we noticed a nice looking Espresso bar on our last day.   If you are looking for a place to lay your head at night while exploring NY, then location isn't a huge issue.

The Apartment
It's very much like the photos.  However when we arrived it was not clean.  There were bed linens left in a cupboard, so I made up the beds.  I opened a window to air the place and was overwhelmed with dust balls flying through the place.  Under the bed, around the furniture etc. It had been some time since this place had been given a good cleaning.  Adreinne was very responsive when I contacted her, she sent her assistant Paul who came a couple of hours later and did some cleaning.  He was a very nice chap and even offered to go get me some bottled water.  

This apartment is up 3 flights of stairs.  Not a problem for able bodied people.  I arrived alone with baby, stroller and large suitcase.  Adreinne very kindly asked her neighbour below who came along and carried up my case.  It was also no problem leaving the stroller in the hall below.

Overall Adreinnes place is a good choice.  It's reasonably priced and the location opposite the subway is ideal if you're exploring the city."
12940,1430761,7/6/12,1563738,Karen,"Paul was gracious and allowed us to enter the apartment 1 1/2 hours earlier than he expected us.  He still needed to do some cleaning up but he was pleasant and conversational while he did it.  He showed us the ""plumbing problem"" which was that you had to turn the shower on with a pair of channel lock pliers.  He said they were waiting for a part but from the looks of those rusty pliers, I think they had been waiting for a very long time.  Both my husband and myself were nearly scalded the next morning trying to adjust the water temperature with those pliers.  By the end of our 4 night visit we had it figured out but I do hope if you stay here, they have this fixed.  The apartment is quite noisy because it is on the street.  If you close the french doors to the bedroom, you will have a relatively quiet night.  However if like my daughter, you have to sleep on the couch in the living room, you will not get much sleep.  The apartment is right on the street and across from an all night bus stop as well as an elevated train.  The kitchen was nice to have for fixing meals and everything was clean.  The bathroom is big and spacious.  The french doors that separate the bedroom from the main living area are glass so don't count on any privacy if there are more than two of you staying in this apartment.  The apartment is convenient to subways that go directly into Manhattan and though a very busy area of Brooklyn, we felt relatively safe.  You do have to unlock and re-lock 5 locks using 4 keys to get into and out of the apartment so if someone was actually trying to molest you in any way, you would never get into the apartment fast enough to get away!"
12940,1728873,17/7/12,265196,Vanessa,"Nice apartment was east to get to Manhatten and close to Prospect Park. Enjoyed being in Brooklyn as it is a bit more 'realistic' than staying in Manhatten less tourists, and a well price nail shop near by. Close to food outlets for and last min essentials, aundry shops and a drycleaner. 

A/C wasn't installed when we arrived but this was sorted out very quickly with 2 units put in. 

Apartment is near a rail station so that meant being woken up at 8am every morning by the noise in the main and second bedroom but I guess you could buy earplugs or something.

Apartment was well decorated but not much entertainment in the house ie no tv or radio.

12940,2698068,24/10/12,3382157,Alejandra,"The apartment was comfortable and very clean. Luminous and spacious. Very close to the subway. Adreinne was helpful and well organized. There is not intercom or telephone, so if you will receive visits or your lost baggage, you must be waiting at the window..."
12940,3259381,4/1/13,1454511,Andrina,"We were 4 people staying in the apartment and we found it clean and comfortable, although it was a little bit cold in the main bedroom.
The location is excellent; extremely close to the subway, and finding street parking nearby is very easy. Communication with Adreinne was excellent and she was very helpful/pleasant. I would definitely consider staying here again the next time we visit NYC."
12940,3727322,9/3/13,4459383,John,"I enjoyed a comfortable and convenient long-term stay.  The street outside is a bit harsh, as other reviews have mentioned, but you can head out in any direction and find many of Brooklyn's gems close by.  Tatsu Sushi, Outpost, and my favorite, Alice's Arbor, just to name a few.  There is much more if you venture out a little farther.  It's really great to have the C train right there.  The flat is cozy and sufficiently supplied.  The bedroom is a bit noisy, but I could live with it.  Adrienne is a quick responder to questions and problems, which is all you can really ask for.   As an added bonus, I had a car while I was there and I could almost always park right in front.  Crazy I know."
12940,4303396,26/4/13,5630979,Erica,"This was a very nice, stylish apartment that was very conveniently located near the subway. There were some nice cafes in the area  too - especially Outpost for coffee/sandwiches, Hill Cafe for brunch and Peaches Hothouse for southern-style dinner and cocktails. There is also a supermarket round the corner on Fulton. The apartment had everything we needed and the daybed in the little room of the bedroom was perfectly comfortable for one. The only problem we had with the apartment was the noise from the street as the windows in the bedroom + side room do not properly close and are covered with plastic that rattles a bit in the wind. The bus stop opposite and other traffic can be quite noisy and disruptive if you want a lie-in but we didn't find it affected our sleep. We appreciated Adreinne's independent approach (self pick-up of the keys, wifi password provided) and she was very understanding and flexible when we had some confusion at the end of our stay. Airbnb were also very helpful about this and overall we were very pleased. I would thoroughly recommend this apartment."
12940,5116181,13/6/13,93378,Tony,"Not 100% what I expected from the airbnb visuals, but serviceable. If you need a place to stay close to Franklin station - this is the place. "
12940,13791864,4/6/14,14834447,Joel,"Adreinne is a great host, quick responding by mail and service minded. We loved the apartment, clean and cosy. Bathroom and kitchen was super nice. The location was everything we wanted from our visit to New York. Less than 100 meters from the metro train that took us directly to/from the airport (JFK) and downtown Manhattan. Fulton street is a great place to stay, full of nice shops, delis and food spots. This was my first time staying in Brooklyn, but I'm definitely coming back."
12940,15530983,11/7/14,14544754,Dominique,"Nice stay in Adreinne's Brooklyn appartment. The AC has been appreciated as it was really hot outside! The proximity of the subway station is very good point.
The only drawback is the S train station that is noisy.
Thanks to our hostess!"
12940,19000943,4/9/14,19756039,Ariel,"Our experience in Adrienne's Brooklyn apartment was very good!
The place looks great for 4 people it have all of the equipment that you need! We didn't missed a thing!
Adrienne is a wonderful host! She made as feel at home!
The place was very clean!
The neighborhood is not so pleasant for girls at night to come back late. But the apartment is very safe and secure.  
The place is very close to subway station to reach everywhere you need in the city and it takes between 20-35 min. 
Theres a great supermarket near the apartment but its not open late night. 
Adrienne was available any time we needed her and helped us when we had needed.  
We had the best time in NYC a lot thanks to apartment and the host (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
12940,20261695,26/9/14,10390477,Lynn,"The flat itself was big and nice and very clean so I enjoyed my stay there. 
I was there for business on my own and obviously had a longer way to go to get to mid-town but that was my choice. Its convenient that the station is right opposite because I would not necessarily recommend girls to run around that part of Brooklyn on their own so much. I did not feel unsafe though either. If you're a group of people and planning on spending lots of time in Brooklyn then I guess its perfect. I did not meet Adreinne but instructions were clear and it was easy to get in and out. 

The matrass wasn't great and the road quite noisy but again that's not a huge issue. "
12940,20951954,8/10/14,2651351,Richard,Very near to the subway to Manhattan! Nice flat with everything you need. The wifi works without any problems. We can recommend this Place absolutly. 
12940,21219057,13/10/14,20690469,Clément,"Beautiful apartment, the neighborhood and the subway are a bit noisy, but you will forget the noise really fast.
The subway is really near, 15-20 minutes ride to Manhattan.
The autonomy is nice.
I would rent again if i ever go back to New York."
12940,25016979,5/1/15,22888255,Marine,"We had an amazing time!
We did not see Adreinne in person, but her instructions to get to the appartment were very clear. 
The place is really comfortable, clean, and we felt at home. I loved the design and the atmosphere ! we had everything to cook, chill and have a nice time.
It 's located in a nice part of Brooklyn, we felt safe there. the subway station is right around the corner, so you can get to Manhattan very quickly. 
The only two things that can make you hesitate are the fact that the flat is on the second floor, with no elevator ( but nice wooden stairs), and no TV (for some people that's important). If you don't care about those details, this is a place that I highly recommend! 
"
12940,39544383,24/7/15,20447849,Sonja,"Just on the verge of tipping over to a total hippster dominated domane, this brownstone hideout is still a part of gritty, lively brooklyn. Location and apartment were great, the autonomy was great, would definitely go again. Just remember (as in all of amerika) to bring your own toilet paper!"
12940,41663919,8/8/15,15761161,Marie,"Adreinne's place was great. We spent few days in it and it was very clean with everything we needed for us and our two little boys. It's a second floor apartment but, honestly, it's very easy to access. Very close from all the commodities and only two steps from subway to Manhattan. The place is very safe (we come back one evening at 11 p.m without felling unsecured) and the neighborhood very nice. We can park easily (we had a car). The only thing : be careful about parking because we had our car towed because it was parked just beside a fire hydrant we did not respect the 15 feet. But some neighbors helped us to find it. We never went to Brooklyn and it was just perfect. The ""petit plus"" as we say in French : the pictures which are in the wall of Adreinne's apartment are really beautiful and help to make you feel good ! "
12940,46424007,10/9/15,39076556,Jenna,Adreinne's apartment is lovely.  So bright and clean and felt like a real Brooklyn experience.  Perfectly situated a 2 minute walk from the C train and within walking distance of some great bars and restaurants.

"
12940,54347708,18/11/15,47414425,Miguel,"El apartamento era muy acogedor y tenía todo lo necesario para hacer tu estancia muy cómoda. Estaba limpio y bien cuidado. La estación de Metro estaba cruzando la calle y en 20-25 minutos podías estar en el corazón de Manhattan. A nosotros no nos molesto para nada el ruido del tren. La zona tiene un par de supermercados y varios comercios muy próximos. Tal vez la única mejora, sería el colchón. En general el piso es muy recomendable."
12940,56251287,11/12/15,48393843,Karen,Had a great stay in Brooklyn. The location was perfect and conveniently located across the street from the subway. There are plenty of shops and cafes close by and anything you need can be found close by. The apartment itself was very spacious and had everything we needed. The only downside was having to carry quite a large suitcase up so many stairs! The downstairs neighbour was also very friendly and helpful!
12940,56724072,17/12/15,5529625,Jasmine,"Adreinne provided all necessary information we needed. She explained it very well so that everything worked perfect. 
It's a cute and clean apartment. However it is relatively noisy, but with earplugs you can sleep quite well in the night.
The subway is across the street where the local train to Manhattan stops. It takes approximately 25 minutes to midtown Manhattan."
12940,63886712,28/2/16,4178646,Anne,"We never met Adrienne, she explain us how to go in but when we had problem with big water leak we had in her appartment...
she wasn't so available...

In summer (without rain), this appartment is very nice with a lot of light and a nive view on the subway.
It's relativly calm and with nice furniture inside"
12940,67831631,31/3/16,32726201,Harry,"Adrienne's instructions on how to find the place were terrific, the location was exceptional - basically perfect. Right next to the C Train, which makes it so easy to get on and off of Manhattan. We stayed three weeks with three people (all separate beds), which was a bit of a stretch but manageable."
12940,71551716,26/4/16,15461276,Nathalie,"""Charming"" stay in the 3rd floor flat of a typical brooklin house. Located in the renovating brooklin close to subway c/s lines giving direct access to new york from lower manhattan to northern harlem. We really appreciated resting in Adreinne's appartment. With its 70s design furnitures, nice clichés and motown soul, you will enjoy the owner culture and art. Only regret was not to meet her. If we don't have the same roots, I guess we share the same cultural interests and influences."
12940,72601837,3/5/16,55235895,Marie,Great proximity to the subway for exploring the city. Spacious apartment with good facilities.

We loved to cook in the well equipped kitchen and to have breakfast at our own table. Close to major subway-lines, it's the ideal place for a first time NY. Adrienne also had a good view on nice places to eat, drink, relax in the neighbourhood. Highly recommended. "

The apartment was nicely decorated with everything we needed from kitchen supplies to towels. The bathroom was really nice with a bathtub and a good shower. The apartment could use some attention but was in general nice.

The apartment is conveniently located next to the subway. It's good that it's only 1 min walk to transportation, the downside was that you could hear the trains from the apartment. There was also a construction site next to the building which woke us up early in the morning. The noise wasn't a big concern for me.

I can recommend Adreinne's apartment!"
12940,112998243,9/11/16,8687558,Dick,"We had a really great stay at Adreinne's apartment!! Large apartment for being NY and fresh bathroom with all the amenities described in the profile.

Train station is right in front of the apartment so it is extremely convenient but it can get noisy at night so it might be difficult for a light sleeper.  Otherwise, it is a perfect stay ! "
12940,202969215,13/10/17,12857730,Caroline,My friends and I had a pleasant stay in Adreinne’s apartment. I really loved and enjoyed all the art on the walls. The apartment has everything you need. You are super connected if you stay at Adreinne’s apartment. The subway station is just 2 min away and you are super fast in Downtown Brooklyn and Manhattan with the C and A train. Thank you for this lovely stay!

12940,250896451,6/4/18,64811032,Ludovic,The host canceled this reservation 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
12940,265017532,15/5/18,31798603,Caroline,"Adreinne's place is mostly as pictured, it's got charm, it's close the the C train, and the neighborhood has lots of great restaurants nearby. There were just a couple of issues to take into account or check with the host on before booking. The unit is up two sets of somewhat steep, slightly scary stairs, some of the steps have come loose from the wall and the railing is very low and also loose. The place is pretty noisy, you can hear the neighbors and there is currently construction happening right next door. Some odd things; we had two guests but there was only one towel, there are potentially three beds (bed, fold-out couch and futon in a room connected to the bedroom) but no extra sheets, and we couldn't find any silverware.

Overall I would say this place is a decent value and worth considering, but again just make sure you check with the host on some of the things above."
13050,36338,18/4/10,72656,Laurent,"We loved Jennifer's apartment. Really nicely decorated duplex,comfortable,clean and spacious.A couple of blocks from the subway. Safe and quiet neighborood.
Jennifer was very accomodating and helpful.
A perfect stay for us."
13050,45154,23/5/10,98011,Nikki,We enjoyed staying at J's home.  We had everything we needed to make for a comfortable stay.  We felt welcomed.  The subway is only 3 blocks away and there are places to get coffee and groceries in the neighborhood.  The only drawback is that in the interior there is a circular narrow metal stairway between the two floors which was manageable but a little difficult for us 60 year olds.
13050,68541048,5/4/16,7217959,Aragsan,"Jennifer's place was so beautiful. It is just like how the photos show. She has an eye for great decor. Her place feels so home-y and welcoming. Jennifer was a great host. It was easy to contact her if I needed anything. She was also very accommodating since we got to the city so late. The neighborhood is very pretty and has great restaurants, stores, and great access to the subway. I would definitely stay here again in the future. "
13050,77222134,30/5/16,3524355,Mathieu,"Nous avons adorés notre séjour dans l'appartement de Jennifer. 

La communication fût très facile et elle fît tout en son pouvoir pour rendre notre séjour agréable. L'arrivé et le départ furent aussi très simple.

L'appartement est très joli et plutôt spacieux. C'est idéal pour une famille avec un ou deux enfants. Il y a deux chambre avec un lit double chacun, mais l'une d'entre elles est une chambre d'enfant avec un lit en hauteur. Nous étions 5 et j'ai dormi sur le divan qui était très confortable... tout dépend du niveau de confort que vous recherchez. Il y a plusieurs livres pour enfants et ma fille de 9 ans était très heureuse de constater que plusieurs d'entre eux étaient en français. Le seul petit hic auquel je pense, c'est qu'il faisait plutôt chaud dans l'appartement en général et qu'il n'y avait qu'un seul ventilateur situé dans la chambre principale. Mais il faut dire qu'il faisait entre 35'C et 40'C cette fin de semaine-là à NYC !!

Le quartier est très agréable mais peut être assez bruyant le soir. Pour notre part ça ne nous a pas trop dérangé... mais nous vivons dans un quartier similaire à Montréal et nous sommes habitués aux bruits urbains. Si vous êtes sensible aux décibels nocturnes ça pourrait vous causer des ennuis. Sinon c'est un quartier populaire très agréable de Brooklyn qui a une belle mixité sociale.

Nous y retournerions volontiers !! "
13050,79583344,13/6/16,16605351,Christina,"This Airbnb experience was one of the best I have had. The apartment is comfy, welcoming and easy to get to. The bunk bed is perfect for kiddos. Jenn was easy to talk with and very helpful. This gets my highest recommendation. "
13050,83024744,30/6/16,70970328,Ada,"Nasz pobyt na Brooklynie w apartmencie Jennifer byl fantastyczny. Mieszkanie jest ogromne i bardzo przestrzenne, bylo tez fantastycznie przygotowane i posprzatane na nasz przyjazd. Spacer do metra zajmuje ok 10 minut, ale okolica jest przyjemna i pozwala poznac klimat i zwyczaje kolejnych mieszkancow."
13050,84926439,9/7/16,63791504,Irene,Wunderbares und gemütliches Appartement mit freundlichen Nachbarn.Wir fühlten uns sofort zu Hause und die Gastgeberin war sehr zuvorkommend. Wir kommen gerne wieder!  Auch für Familien bestens geeignet.
13050,90171410,31/7/16,2275737,Jonathan & Stefanie,"Jennifer was a wonderful host!  House rules and necessary info (wifi password, recycling, etc.) was clearly laid out on a sheet of paper. Building is in range of a Pokestop!

There were a couple of quirks with this BnB that should be noted.  We happened to travel on one of the hottest weeks of the year and had to beef up the air circulation in the child's room where the loft bed is located.  With the bed sitting right under the ceiling, the hot air rose and the AC from the window below the bed could not reach the bed without some help.  Jennifer had an additional box fan that we were able to plug in and it made the room so much more comfortable.

As for the other quirk, we were informed that the air conditioners draw a lot of power and there is a tendency for the breaker to be tripped if you're not creative with where you plug in your hair dryer.  This only applied to the upper floor, so the hair dryer was used in the bedroom downstairs.  Depending on how many outlets you need for your devices, you may end up charging your phone, curling  your hair, or applying makeup in an alternate room away from your sleeping area (ie: kitchen).  Plenty of seating though, from regular furniture to bar stools.  Mirrors are not lacking, either.

Given the heat, we weren't interested in walking any sort of distance, so you'll be happy to know that the B43 and B52 (you can chuckle) buses are just a block or two away and can easily get you to a variety of subway lines. Near the A and C train stop is a great grocery store that prepares a variety of hot food for you, even late-night (visited after midnight).  We never once felt uncomfortable with our surroundings.

The two queen beds were very comfortable! I'm jealous that a 10 year old has such a cool room with fun books to read. We were away from the house the majority of our stay, but what we did see of the decor was nice!  Washer/Dryer is available to you, as well as a fridge, iron, and coffee maker.  The towels were great and PooPourri was available to us in the bathroom.

Jennifer was available by phone/text for any of our questions.  A lockbox is used for you to put the keys at check-in/check-out. The way the building is laid out, Jennifer was able to drop off anything that may have been needed (ie: additional coffee and toilet paper) without having to enter the apartment.  Just make sure to specify your check-in/check-out times days in advance so you can ensure the place is ready when you need it. Thanks Jennifer!"
13050,93433929,12/8/16,9120668,Morgane,"L'Appartement de Jennyfer et de sa fille est vraiment très agréable et chaleureux. Il y a beaucoup de livres en français et de jeux pour les enfants. On s'y sent très bien.  Il y a ce qu'il faut pour faire la cuisine, même s'il n'y a pas à proprement parler de salle à manger, il y a une petite table basse ronde dans le salon ou l'on peut s'installer. Il y a la climatisation si besoin et c'est agréable pour la nuit s'il fait chaud. Il faut marcher un peu jusqu'au métro (7 blocks donc 15 mn avec des enfants ).

13121,162126,2/1/11,276884,Anudipa,"This was my and my friend's first bnb experience and it was really good. Jullett's home was clean,spacious and lovely. We were even provided with a mini fridge and a microwave in the room which were very helpful. Though it is a bit far away from the main city, the transportation is real good and it was not at all a problem.

Thank you Jullett for making our first ever visit to New York City so comfortable and memorable."
13121,175387,27/1/11,352769,Ginger,"The perfect place to stay. I was visiting for a week for work and it was so wonderful to come back to a place that felt like home. No matter how crazy my work schedule, Jullett was completely cool. There when you need her, not when you don't. 

Jullett is the perfect host. There was a snow storm when I was there and before I had to go to work the walkways were shoveled. I haven't gotten that at major hotel chains! 

I will definitely be staying here whenever work brings me back and perhaps for a vacation since it is the most affordable place anywhere near NYC. I can't think of enough great things to say! Absolutely wonderful!"
13121,230816,18/4/11,484884,Andrew,"Super host that worked with us when our plane was delayed. We did not arrive until past midnight. She was easy to communicate with by phone and email. 
The location was good for a quick night crash when we flew. It is a good distance from the city which is why we only booked one night. It is clean and appears like the pictures. "
13121,293630,1/6/11,474888,Jarrett,"Jullet was an AWESOME host! She was super friendly and very helpful. The room was spotless, top notch, had it's own full sized private bathroom, and air conditioning.

Great price. Great location. couldn't have asked for a better deal. Highly recommended."
13121,320965,18/6/11,535551,Beatric,"Jullett was a wonderful host. 
Her little Hostel is clean and super comfortable.Its quite a ride to Manhattan but it's worth it.
The room is big and the beds are just perfect. A grocery store and a bus stop are right around the corner
All in all I had a very nice time at Julletts home with a very human price."
13121,335984,26/6/11,465190,Joyce,"my stay at jullett place was outstanding the place is  very clean and well kept and well organized.. if anyone is looking for a place too stay in newyork .. this is the place too stay you won't be disapointed,.the location is great. on my next visit i well defindly stay there again..

13121,412349,1/8/11,823602,Emily,"Jullets place was very nice and clean. Jullettt was extremely hospitable and offered us great directions as to how to get around NYC. The only thing was that it was a bit of a trek to get into the heart of Manhattan, but definitely worth it for the low price that it was. "
13121,455678,18/8/11,850672,John,"At first me and my partner were wary of Airbnb because of the newness of the concept but after trying it out for the first time at Jullett's place I would personally recommend it to all my friends. Jullett was very friendly to me and my family and made us feel like we were at a second home. The place was clean and met all our needs. Thumbs up to the place and 2 thumbs up for Jullett our hostess! The bustop is a 2 min walk which goes directly to the subway where you just ride to Manhattan directly , there were also enough deli's in the neighborhood to buy whatever groceries one might need. If you ever want to travel to NY take my word and stay with Jullett right on budget :)"
13121,491781,31/8/11,886898,Ian,"Jullett was a great woman! She is really  friendly! She drove my friend to airport, when he almost late to the plane. And woke me up at 4 a.m. when I had to go to my plane and gave me pizza. Thank's a lot! "
13121,540212,17/9/11,801688,Magda,"If you are looking for home away from home, this is the right spot. Jullett is a wonderful woman and will help you with anything you need. Location is great. Close to the train LIRR which is only 30 minutes to Manhattan or to the Long Beach. I  would stay there any time again."
13121,611739,9/10/11,1170074,Elaine,"My friend and I stayed at Jullett's b&b for 9 nights.  Jullett was very friendly and helpful.  Jullett loaned us her maps and gave us recommandations on places to visit and how to get around.  The house was very clean and tidy and there was a nice variety of food in the fridge for the guests.

Only downside was that it was a little far from Manhattan.  There was a bus stop right outside the b&b but it was a ~20 min bus ride to the subway station, followed by about a ~30 min ride on the subway before we reach Time Square.

Overall, we had a nice time staying at Jullett's lovely b&b and would highly recommend it to everyone else.  Thanks Jullett!"
13121,637645,17/10/11,1157609,Michael,Stayed 4 nights. Very nice and clean home. Bonus was the use of the kitchen.  The room was very comfortable. There was a yappy dog barking first night.  Walls were thin and heard upstair's guest. Was told we couldn't use AC after midnight even though it's advertised as a having AC.  We had one room with 2 beds with private bath - good size with nice decor. 
13121,684262,1/11/11,1330320,Antonius,"This my first time experience with staying in a 'non-hotel' environment opened my thinking that I can get a lot more and spend less with staying at the Right on Budget! Jullett is very accomodative with the check-in time, very nice person, facility is extra clean, quiet location but safe. My family will comeback again when we go to NY next time! Sincere thanks to Jullett, two thumbs UP!"
13121,1042565,26/3/12,1532175,Roey,"We came to visit our family and friends in NY.  We stayed for 3 weeks and had a great time.
Jullett's place was nice and clean. She was very nice and accommodating to our needs.
Very convenient access to public transportation including: buses, subway, and train. JFK airport is just a 10 minute bus ride."
13121,1098848,8/4/12,2001452,Reynaldo,"It was our family’s first trip using this website and Jullett's place. Jullett was very accommodating with our arrival time and gave us good instructions on how to get around using the New York’s bus and subway. The place was clean, quit, and safe.  Next trip we make to NYC we plan to use her place."
13121,1156590,20/4/12,1851531,Rob,"Jullett was really responsive to our emails and was great on our arrival. Her place was really convenient to the bus. rail and light rail service in and out of Manhatten and her kindness in explaining the low-down on how and what to do was  very helpful. We found our beds comfortable and the ensuite we had was luxury. Kitchen all the go and breakfast too.  We had privacy but also opportuities to meet a couple of other room occupiers.  The area is pretty safe and the locals were really helpful with directions and even bailing us out on some  train fares we misjudged. Close shopping for basic foods etc. 
Got a $40 flat fare there from La Guardia and then a quick $25 cab to JFK at the end of our stay. 
Our room had a queen and a double bed in it so we took the opportunity to really stretch out. There was a bit of noise from upstairs but it calmed down at 12.The neighbourhood was pretty quiet really. We would go back there no worries should we wish to visit again the city that never sleeps. The American Indian Museum down by the Staten Island Ferry  was awesome but it closes at 5 so get in a good two hours early- you will be rewarded. Thanks Jullett. "
13121,1304522,19/5/12,2220552,Marion,It was a really nice time ! Thank you very much.
13121,1380370,29/5/12,2468924,Lillian,"Clean, comfortable, friendly, & cozy. Great for the most part. Main cons - air conditioning could have been cooler and we weren't able to buy metro cards at the train station that was close by. So transportation was an issue. No taxi would pick us up in the area. We ended up driving everywhere. "
13121,1463316,11/6/12,2572321,Lauren,"Jullett was very hospitable. When we arrived way later due to the 4 hours of gridlock traffic we were stuck in, she was there to let us in. Her place is very close to the bus and trains. The bedroom we stayed in was perfect with two very comfortable beds, a small refridgerator, and our own private bathroom! My friend and I had a very nice stay! Thanks Jullett!"
13121,1526214,20/6/12,2621599,Jamy,"The room is nicer in person, very quiet & clean We enjoyed our stay!! Service was great. Thank you for letting us stay at your place Jullett."
13121,1616179,2/7/12,2568758,Liz,"I stayed with Jullett and my two daughters for a week. She was a wonderful host and could not do enough to help us out. The bus stop to the subway was right outside the house so getting around was easy. The trip to Manhatten was full of fun and surprises and gave us an opportunity to see people and do things we would not normally have done.

The house was and still will be spotless, Jullett is meticulous and has though of everything including food in the fridge and plenty of toiletries.

There was a conveinence store just round the corner which had everything - it was also a deli and was open all night. next to that was a dry cleaners and across the road a launderette who would do your washing for you if you did not have time $10 for 10 pounds. 

I was a little confused by one of the postings who said they could not get tickets for bus and trains, there is a western union 1 minutes walk from Julletts and you can get an unlimited pass for 29.99 for 7 days and that will take you all over the place using subway and buses.

We would definitely come back here Jamaica in Queens is a really cool place wish we could have stayed longer.

Thanks Jullett for a great time and an easy place to stay
"
13121,1756692,20/7/12,2879606,Djhony,"I found the room as expected with private bath.
The room was neat as well and bus stops were close.
As it was extremely Hot and I was travelling with my Twin couple of 15 months old (infants), I had to exceed by one hour the limit of time use for the A/C the first night (which I think if there was a fan in the ceiling, i would power OFF the A/C by midnight as expected).
Jullet left some water in the fridge on our disposal prior our arrival (which i appreciated).

I would advice future guess to wake up hours before departure in order to rearrange the room the way it was found before leaving for the airport (as it seems that the room is expected to be left the way it was found, which in my case, with two 15 months old children in my hand,  could not happen at 100% under the pressure of picking a flight at 9 AM JFK).

Thanks again Jullet!"
13121,1832895,29/7/12,3021446,Rose,Very nice comfortable place.  Clean and accomodating.  Jullett was very friendly and helpful.  Access to public transportation was close by and easy to navigate.  I would stay again!

Hello,
Here by this note I want to thank to you for all things.
I had a nice time in New York and enjoyed from this trip.
your home and room was very clean, near to bus.
Your guidance was perfect, with you explanation I visited many beautiful places and used my time very well.
I would like to come there and stay in your home again, hopfully next time, probably soon, I do not know.
Thanks for your hospitality,
Thanks for all things.

13121,2412105,25/9/12,3183050,Tibor,"We have spent a great 6 nights at Jullett's place. It is quite close to JFK (paid 14 $ for taxi) in a good, quiet neighborhood. We travelled to Manhattan every day back and forth so be prepaired to pay the LIRR fee which is around 10 $(return ticket) in off-peak season. It will bring you to the Penn Station in 25 mins and generally running in every hour 24/7. Our room was clean with comfortable beds with our own bathroom. There were a few additional rooms with other guests on our floor with a common full-equipped kitchen. Jullett was very helpfull and flexible (we arrived in the late night due to the bed weather on the airport). I would certainly recommend the place to everyone."
13121,2802682,4/11/12,1688334,Dasha,"it was our last minute request, because another recervation was cancelled one day before our arrival to NYC. The room is clean and has private bathroom. The only minus is that the house is situated a bit too far from Manhatten and it takes around 1-1.20 hour to get to the city. You can also take the express train but it costs around 6$ one way. 
But in general our time in NYC was great and Jullet was very nice and helpfull host, she even kept our luggage when we went to Miami for 5 days! Thank you so much for your help, Jullet!"
13121,3225419,2/1/13,4312351,Maria Antonia,"The place is VERY clean, that was like the most important thing for us, and that you have a private bathroom, the area where is placed seems to be very safe. Jullett is a great host, she helped us to find out how to get to the most importantes places of NY, the only little problem is that takes like an hour to get to Manhattan but the house is located where you can fin transportation pretty easy, so it was fine for us. Thank you Jullett, i will be back in your house, for sure. "
13121,3912530,26/3/13,5473142,Bruno Lotfi,"Short visit in NY ,really liked the room ,very clean and big enough ,the bathroom also was good size .

Perfect location if you need a  quick access to NYC in around 30 min by LIRR and in the same time very close to JFK airport at a very reasonable price .
I will definitely visit again this place during my next travel

13121,3967422,31/3/13,5566764,Maria,"Jullett Dilllon's house was exactly what i needed to relax and get away from everything. The house was clean, quiet and her brother was around just in case something was needed. I didn't get a chance to meet Jullett because of her job schedule, but I was very please with the accommodation. The bus stop was across the street from her house. Her brotther gave me directions where to find the 99cent store, Chinese restaurant, Corner store and pizza shop.

I will recommend your Jullett house to my friends and family.

Thanks Jullett for open your house to me and my friend Lorraine."

13121,4347154,29/4/13,5871415,Ashley,Great room with a good amount of space with a private bathroom. Very clean  apartment overall and I would recommend this place to anyone that wants to visit the city at a cheap rate. The apartment is right next to the LIRR Locust Manor station and gets to the city in like a half an hour. Close to a lot of convenience stores and places to eat. Friendly neighborhood overall and if you need help with any questions don's hesitate to ask Jullett or her brother Garnett.
13121,4968209,4/6/13,4434938,Vivian,"We spend 2 nights at Jullett place. The apparment was very clean. We needed because we wanted to stay near the airport. Everything was ok. She gave us information about the appartment and her brother help us a lot with many other things, like the bus to the airport and find a place to eat. He was very patient and nice with us. We took the bus at 3.04 am to go to the airport, and was right on time.  "
13121,5072829,10/6/13,3940102,Emily,"The room itself was wonderful. We had our own bathroom and closet. There is an air conditioning unit also which was nice in mid summer. The location was a bit deceiving. If you want to head into the city, you should expect over an hour of commuting. We found it easier to drive on some days. Jullett's brother was much more helpful. He gave us a map of the subway system, directions on how to get there, and advice on where to go. There are also very strict house rules. Showers can't be longer than 5 minutes long, air conditioning can't e run for over a certain amount of time, etc. Overall, we thought the room was very affordable and worth the price."

13121,16527376,28/7/14,18107571,Courtney,"My experience with Julett was my very first AirBnB experience as well, so I did not really know what to expect going into it.  I arrived in NYC earlier than expected and Julett did respond to my text message and allow me to come to her home earlier than the scheduled check in.  The directions she gave were accurate and the LIRR does stop literally 2 blocks from her house. She gave me a map and showed me where to go in NYC, and walked me outside and showed me where all the bus stops were.  The only CONS, I have for this stay were 
1. My reservation was modified to stay in a different room in her room than what I booked. She said that she had some regulars come in for the weekend and she gave them my reserved room.  The room I was moved to was fine, however, the main reason I requested my particular room was because of the private bathroom.  So my friend and I had to use the bathroom down the hall, but Julett assured me there would be no one else using that bathroom at all but me.  On at least 3 occasions, I went into that bathroom and the toilet was unflushed from someone using it, I knew it was not me or my friend, so someone in the house was obviously using the bathroom as well, and also not cleaning up behind themselves.  Also, one morning that I was taking a shower, someone kept knocking on the door and twisting at the handle, when I finally exited the bathroom I saw that there was a 7 or 8 year old girl standing there like she was waiting to use the bathroom, again I was told that this would not be a shared bathroom.  When I was walking back to the kitchen, I also noticed an older man brushing his teeth in the kitchen sink.
2. I'm assuming the other people that were staying there were a family of about 5 or so people, so it was uncomfortable for me to walk to and from the bathroom because they would be sitting at the kitchen table just kind of staring.  My friend and I even came home one night at about 1 am, and they were still sitting at the kitchen table. So again it made me uncomfortable going back and forth to the shower.
3. The home is extremely muggy, I'm assuming because the air does not run much. I had a wall unit in my room, but it still did not really cool the area down, so it was hard sleeping being so hot.

All together this is a pretty nice home and my experience was not that bad. However,it is just extremely far from the city so be careful with coming back so late the trains only run like every hour. I found out the hard way!"
13121,19903906,20/9/14,21168248,Yoshihisa,"Jullett's a nice host. Comfortable. Easy access to Manhattan. If I have a chance to go to NY again, I would stay her house and talk with her more."

Elle m'a demandé si j'avais un numéro de réservation et dans ce cas lire ses recommandations. Je lui ai exprimé mes difficultés en anglais…toujours pas du tout aimable. Pas du tout rassurée. Elle m'a ensuite bien expliqué pour aller à NY City, parfait pour cette partie là. La chambre est correcte, le lit bon, par contre un(e) voisin(e) au dessus fait du bruit( marche comme sur un plancher) jusqu'à 1h du mat et recommence à 5h …quand dort il (elle)? très bruyant aussi avec les avions…10 minutes de l'aéroport et mauvaise isolation phonique."

Also, the place is 5mins from JFK airport by cab. But almost 1.5hrs to Manhattan if you take the bus and subway or 30mins if you take the Long Island Railroad."

Only downside is you can hear the noise from upstairs pretty well, so it gets annoying during night time cuz people upstairs were moving around stuff even after 12am."
13121,33733164,31/5/15,33927832,Gregory,"Upon arriving at Jullett's Airbnb I introduced myself and extended my hand but she stated ""that won't be necessary"", so the initial experience was not welcoming. The handle to the front gate came off in my hand in front of Jullett but that was replaced later. The place was as described. Room and bathroom were clean, but one of the towels although I felt it was clean it had some yellowish stains. I called and texted Jullett but got no response at first, then seeing  a family member on the property and asked them to help me out which occurred a day later exchanging the towel and providing me with a requested bath towel. She was very nice. The only nightstand lamp was broken (there was an overhead light) and I informed Jullett about that with no response. I did feel safe in the neighborhood. The parking was A+. Although the two dogs behind the gate made alot of noise they were nice but walking over the poop when departing wasn't. And as a previous reviewer stated there is alot of noise heard over those hardwood floors when trying to sleep. Lastly, I only communicated with the host on check-in; luckily nothing urgent came up. Overall, it's a tossup, you can't beat the price, the place is clean, safe, great parking and some compromising as mentioned above. Thanks."
13121,34045729,3/6/15,33927832,Gregory,The host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

The communication with Jullett was easy, we had no problem during our trip to New York ! "
13121,53021082,3/11/15,36389247,Andre,"Firstly let me say that I went to this apartment with an open mind as it was my first time using the service however I was given an instant shocker when the host didn't turn up until over an hour after my scheduled arrival time and with no one to assist me with checking in I had to sit outside and wait, I tried calling her posted number without success only to see her arrive and as abruptly and unapologetic as ever she walked in with a blande hi. No explanation or apology for being so tardy was given and despite her being rude throughout my entire checking in process I went along with it as she outlined to me when I asked about canceling she swiftly mentioned to me the she won't allow my payment to be released to me. Throughout my entire stay I had no one to get information from as she never answers her phone I had to just do without basic stuff that should have been provided, it was mostly noisy at nights waking me up several times per night. The only positive thing I can say about the apartment is it isn't dirty but the hosts attitude is and on my final day during packing I was made aware that my car which was parked out front was broken into and when the police came to take a report even before I got a chance to thoroughly check my vehicle she told them that they can leave because I don't seem like I cared. All in all I must say it was four days in a nightmare for me and I only went along with it because at the point when I arrived I had no choice but I definitely wouldn't recommend the place as a place to be , the host is rude, the area isn't safe , the place is noisy and generally it wasn't what was described on the site, highly disappointed."

Only “complaint” if any is that the walls are kinda thin. I could hear the people upstairs moving about at various hours of the day and it was LOUD.

Another thing to know, AT&T users, is that the service in that area is poor. I could barely send text messages out."

13394,22210,1/1/10,60211,Wesley,"Alex had a spacious room for us. He was helpful in marking locations in Brooklyn when we asked. 
We were reluctant to stay in Brooklyn, but we enjoyed the old brownstone neighborhood.  We felt it was a very safe neighborhood. It was easy to get to Manhattan on the many express B and Q trains. We enjoyed seeing the skyline of Manhattan and the East River each day.
"
13394,31540,26/3/10,98176,Colleen,Alex was very friendly and helpful. The place is conveniently located near a nice park and trains to the city. 
13394,43446,17/5/10,106406,Brian,"Great location: stone's throw from Ft. Greene Park, the DeKalb Ave scene, lots of subway lines within short walk (easy & fast to get to lower Manhattan).  Brownstone on tree-lined street creates a relaxing, neighborhood feel.  Alex made sure all of the logistics went smoothly--nice spacious room with desk/wireless to get a spot of work done.  And the cat was great company!"
13394,45356,23/5/10,118924,Robert,"Alex was friendly and welcoming.  The building is comfortable and interesting, very much like the neighborhood.  "
13394,68686,25/7/10,19735,J.C,"Alex's apartment is genial, interesting, eclectic--very much like him.  The location is supreme, on one of the loveliest streets--engrossing brownstones, lush trees, cafes/restaus/shops just a meander around the corner-- in Brooklyn.  Your privacy is assured in Alex's apartment but, should he be around, and you're keen to receive excellent conversation, or prosaic and poetic hints and leads about gems or happenings in the city, he's a wonderful resource.  Thanks for a great experience, Alex.  ...and perhaps again, in the future!"
13394,74459,6/8/10,151337,Sharon,"Alex is such a great host, very nice, considerate, helpful. The room is clean, spacious, comfortable - nicely decorated. The common areas and rest of apartment are very clean and well kept as well. Great location - on a beautiful street just off the main part of Fort Greene with all the great shops, restaurants etc it offers. I really enjoyed my stay!"
13394,85106,26/8/10,198829,John,"What can i say about Alex that has not already been said in this forum. He is a very likable, gracious and generous host with a wonderful spacious room available in his apartment. He was also really considerate giving me lots of space and quiet to research and study at the very adequate desk in my room.

The room was very clean and light filled by two towering windows and a large palmy pot plant. the grand 4 post Balinese bed with firm futon was also a treat - as was the super fast/reliable internet connection and vast book collection. 

Bathroom and kitchen were also suitably clean and functional. 

I would happily recommend alex and his house to anyone coming to new york and i would happily stay there again.  

Thanks for being a champ alex!

JK

ps: his friends are great too."
13394,88983,2/9/10,106740,Wilma,"Alex was a very good host, full of local knowledge and very helpful.  The apartment is in a fab spot.  Great fun."
13394,93686,9/9/10,187674,Michael,"A thoroughly enjoyable trip! Apartment was great - nice location, safe, homely and an ideal base for exploring the city. Alex is a friendly and knowledgeable host who was keen to help us make the most of our trip to NY. Highly recommended!"
13394,94883,11/9/10,184827,Kim,"Alex is a thoughtful and generous host. His apartment is in an excellent location near so many wonderful restaurants, and he keeps it nice and clean. I would highly recommend."
13394,100363,19/9/10,142482,Lynette,"Alex was a fun host. Despite a busy schedule he was very accomodating to us and made us feel at home. Great, eclectic apartment in good, safe area of Brooklyn. Easy subway access to everywhere. About 20 min on subway to lower Manhattan. We had a good time with Alex and Frankie the cat (!) and would def stay again! "
13394,128305,27/10/10,237077,Venetia,"Alex was away during my stay, so Frankie (the cat) and I had the apartment all to ourselves and had a great time. I absolutely loved the neighbourhood, great bistros and a very relaxed and friendly feel. It's only a short subway ride or a slightly longer walk to Manhattan and the apartment itself is very clean and comfortable (though the mattress is a futon, and firm, which might bother some). I would highly recommend the apartment, so much so that I am going back for a couple more days before I leave town :) "
13394,130656,31/10/10,237077,Venetia,"Second stay at Alex's was just as good as the first time, with the added bonus of getting to meet Alex! I highly recommend a stay in Fort Greene."

13394,152424,12/12/10,199962,Ellie,"I stayed with Alex last week and it was fine. The room and bed are comfortable; the bathroom good. Plus, you have the wonderful company of an aged cat named Frankie who is friendly but not intrusive. My few conversations with Alex were interesting but too short. I look forward to staying with him again."
13394,158089,24/12/10,213249,Johnson,"I spent an excellent and fun 1 and a half weeks with Alex.  His place is very spacious and big.  You are about two to three block walking distance to everything in the Fort Greene area.  Or if you prefer, you can take the train to Manhattan and it only takes about 30 minutes from the door to Times Square!  

Alex himself is a very relaxed and trusting person.  I just met him for one hour only and he just handed me his keys to leave for a 2 day video shoot!  We shared some great stories and he even made breakfast a few times, which were very delicious.  

He does have a cat named Frankie but he is very chill and relaxed.  You can pet him all you want and then close your door to leave him out.  Frankie doesn't care.  I would recommend staying with Alex."
13394,161440,1/1/11,53314,Sue,"Alex's space is large and clean and very warm in winter. It is so well located that everything - including subways, BAM, wine, great food is in walking distance. He is very helpful and a delightful and charming host. 
The bed is a fabulous adventure. Thanks!"
13394,163902,3/1/11,302618,Alex,"Alex was a great host. Very personable and helpful. We had some fun conversation. He can give you lots of pointers. The room was pretty good size, bigget then you'd typically find in a New York hotel.  There is lots of space to store your stuff and Alex provides towels and all the bedding.  The location was great as well.  It's close to Fort Greene park and the nearest DeKalb train station is only 1 stop from Manhattan.  15 to 20 min, and you are in Manhattan.  Will definitely stay again."
13394,173253,22/1/11,310586,Meaghan,"This is a great spot. Plenty of space, very clean, lots of interesting books to skim and in an ideal location. Alex is a lovely host and I appreciated all his insight. I would most certainly come again."
13394,179021,7/2/11,310586,Meaghan,"I stayed with Alex for a whole month, he is a great roommate, I had to leave suddenly due to a family illness and he was most accommodating and helpful with my adjusted travel plans. He is a most lovely man, a font of information on the neighborhood, the borough and indeed even the city. Be sure to try his family's olive oil, it is delish! And his library is most fun on a winter's day."
13394,196141,10/3/11,406239,C H,"Alex is a very gracious and friendly host who made me feel right at home.  And the room itself is very spacious and comfortable, with a great book collection and nice desk space for any work.  The neighborhood is charming as well.  I enjoyed my stay and would stay again!"
13394,208090,24/3/11,322254,Rachel,Alex was a thoughtful and friendly host. Apartment was lovely and in a great location. Would definitely recommend staying with Alex if you get the chance!
13394,213488,30/3/11,465443,Carey,Alex was a fabulous host!!!! Place was perfect and he makes a mean coffee... Will definitely stay again... Thanks Alex!!!
13394,261629,13/5/11,429529,Cara,"I loved the bedroom here, it was spacious and big enough for me to hang out and relax in. It took very little time to make myself at home!
Alex was a very helpful and accomodating host. We didn't see much of each other during my stay but that was due to both of us having busy work schedules.
You will be sharing the apartment with Frankie the cat too, so if you're not a cat person then this probably isn't the place for you. However, I got to really like Frankie and his ways but kept my door shut in order to have my own cat free space. 

Overall, a great bedroom and a great part of Brooklyn to stay in, highly recommended!"
13394,266084,16/5/11,536903,Veronica,"Beautiful, clean apartment in a safe neighborhood.  Alexander is a great host with lots of info on where to eat, places to visit (neat farmer's market nearby on Saturdays).  I would highly recommend this place, if I come back to NYC I would stay here again!"
13394,275230,22/5/11,364536,Katrine,"We stayed in Alex' room for 3 nights and it was very good. The room is big, clean and there is a lot of nice books and funny stuff. Alex is really nice and we felt very welcome. The area in Brooklyn is beautiful. There is a really nice cafe on the same street, good coffee and food... really chilled out. We would both like to go back and visit Alex again. Thanks"
13394,309558,12/6/11,553282,Liz,"I could not have asked for a better start to my time in NYC! Alex was an incredible host. Helpful, interesting, respectful and full of great stories, advice and directions. His apartment is clean, comfortable and full of interesting pieces of furniture, art, books and objects.  Fort Greene is gorgeous and the apartment is close to everything you could possibly need. The cafe at the end of the street does great food and coffee and the local farmers and flea markets (where Alex sells his olive oil)  are great places to head on a Saturday. There is never a lack of things to do and places to eat in the area and is also the trip to Manhattan on the Subway is quick and easy. 

Hint: Always say yes if Alex asks you to join him and his friends on a night out! 

Thanks Alex! 
"
13394,319665,17/6/11,657800,Aisha,"Alexander was great! Very friendly and accommodating. I would stay there again if I had to. Location is great and Frankie, the cat was very friendly as well. "
13394,331909,24/6/11,579156,Samuel,"I had a great stay with Alex. The apartment is on the parlor (main) floor of the building, thus the room has wonderful high ceilings, is spacious with lovely details. The Balinese-imported bed is really quite stunning, and will comfortably sleep 2. 

I had full use of the kitchen, and laundry facilities, which made my stay all the more homey. 

Frankie, the 18-year-old cat that hangs out in the kitchen, is really sweet, though incredibly frail. Then again, I'll be frail when I'm 89. "
13394,347621,2/7/11,600178,Thao,"I had a wonderful stay and Alex is an extraordinarily generous host who made sure I had everything I need.  He was away on business but I was completely taken care of and he was very responsive through email and text.  

The room is huge and beautiful, lots of character.  The location is perfect, very close to subway, in sweet and charming Fort Greene.  Coffee shops, grocery stores, restaurants, wine shop, all within a few minutes walk.

Highly recommended!"
13394,420019,4/8/11,844726,Kate,"Alex's brownstone apartment was very charming and comfortable.... beautiful street and easy access to public transportation. As a host, Alex was friendly, accommodating and informative.... also a funny, likable guy. Will definitely be my place to stop in Brooklyn"
13394,424569,6/8/11,863669,Elisabeth,"Alex is a great host. He is friendly, hospitable, easy going and supplies you with all the basics. We didn't see a lot of him during our short stay.

The place is great. Clean, nice room, easy access to transit, close to prospect park and all the other great spots in Brooklyn. Alex's flat is perfect for couples, and it is located in a good neighbourhood. "
13394,441463,13/8/11,836247,Glen,"The neighbourhood is great, many restaurants, a nice park, and the trains to Manhattan are a short walk away. The firm, comfortable bed and spacious room were just what we needed to relax after a busy day. Thanks Alex !"
13394,452053,16/8/11,949555,Kate,"Alex was an awesome host :) 

Frankie the cat is adorable too ... definitely a nice companion to go home to!"
13394,460623,20/8/11,898367,Kevin,"It is a very nice area in Brooklyn, close to subways and plenty of places to go nearby. We had a great stay."
13394,467766,22/8/11,978872,Julia,"Alex, Frankie and friends were a joy to be around.  Beautiful apartment, very homey for the homies; my sis and I felt very comfortable, as though we'd lived there for awhile.  And Alex even listened to our last minute acting skit!   Staying with him was nothing like a hotel, but rather like a visit to an old friends place.  While we were given our own room and space, it was just a huge plus that our host couldn't have been friendlier... or suaver **.  Also, French honey is the tastiest... and the olive oil."
13394,477689,26/8/11,996307,Jared,"Alex's place is flat awesome. The room is spacious with eclectic-hip decor and remote controlled lights! Alex himself is generous, informative, and full of interesting stories. Plenty of good restaurants/cafes within walking distance, though the subway is about 5-10 min away (upside, the daily walk past Ft. Greene Park). Overall, highly recommend this spot in downtown Brooklyn."
13394,517676,10/9/11,780782,Marie,"This is a lovely room in a spacious flat in a great area. The bed is comfortable and the bathroom and kitchen facilities are good. Transport links are close and plentiful.

My experience of staying here was not ideal, however, because Alex's twenty-year-old cat had quit using his litter tray, and I spent much of the time cleaning up cat poop. It's not the cat's fault, twenty is pretty old for a cat. But my advice is to check with Alex before you book. If the cat is still going to be your roommate, you may want to stay elsewhere."
13394,550593,20/9/11,988918,Adnan,"Alex, a hospitable host, all cleaned and carefully!) Great area with walking distance to the subway, not far from where you want to just in New York. Hopefully see you again, we had a great time! Thank you very much))"
13394,646921,20/10/11,771553,Brian,"Alex is an interesting, generous and welcoming host with a comfortable apartment convenient for cafes, restaurants and transport."
13394,655914,23/10/11,771919,Wei,I really enjoyed my staying there and Alex's got a really nice apartment.
13394,675746,30/10/11,1241724,Fabienne,"La situation est parfaite, environ 15mn pour gagner Manhattan par la ligne express et j'ai adoré Brooklyn!
J'avais beaucoup aimé la photo de la maison et je n'ai pas été déçue.
Alexander est très accueillant, ""easygoing"" et donne des conseils judicieux pour sortir des sentiers battus. Nous nous sommes tout de suite senties très à l'aise. J'y retournerai volontiers demain!"
13394,689712,3/11/11,1142319,Denise,Alex did everything to make our stay most agreeable and so it was! A great New York appartment in a beautiful and welcoming neighbourhood! I would instantly move in there! Thanks again!
13394,702861,8/11/11,1271446,Karin,"Great place to stay.  Nice neighborhood, easy access to transportation and good restaurants."
13394,724241,16/11/11,1296325,Carla And Piers,"We had a lovely time in Alex'x apartment, though our favourite part being Smooch cafe on the corner, Kirk made us feel like locals. Best flat white in NYC. Sadly we missed the cat by a couple of weeks...

Thanks again"
13394,791286,18/12/11,1415207,Dyana,You will feel inspired and relaxed at Alex's place. A wonderful experience. Forte Green is the best place to stay in New  York. Thanks Alex! 
13394,819756,1/1/12,859727,Emily,"Had a wonderful stay with Alex. A great guy, very interesting, and a fantastic place in Fort Greene. The apartment is in a very good location, close to all of the major subways. Would happily stay here again!"
13394,879717,23/1/12,665991,Evan,"We had a perfect stay at Alex's place while we looked nearby for an apartment of own own.  An excellent launchpad for such a search because he lives in my favorite neighborhood in Brooklyn. 

Alex was away during our stay but he made sure to think of everything.  Getting the keys was flexible and easy even with him away.  Also in case of any issues that might come up he had people in the neighborhood with keys of their own etc.  

The apartment itself is quite comfortable - a brownstone parlor floor with the high ceilings - beautiful design.  The guest bed is detailed with wood carving a kind of canopy (?) style bed. Cool!  Little details around the apartment suggest worldwide adventure.  
Great stuff. "
13394,6984689,2/9/13,6587689,Fenella,"Alex is a great host - even though he was not there during most of my stay, he respondend promptly to any questions, and he had lots of practical advice and tips for the neighbourhood and movies around town. 
The room itself is spacious, with a large and comfy 2-person bed. There was a row of plants right outside the windows to the street, which was lovely. The kitchen is fully equipped for home cooking. Kitchen and bathroom are not all new and shiny, but they are kept very clean.
The best thing about the place is the location: just steps from DeKalb Avenue with its lovely cafés and restaurants and one block from the park. Many subways at close walking distance take you to Manhattan quickly. But you may just want to stay in the area :-)"
13394,7342619,16/9/13,401192,Andy,"Great location in a lovely neighborhood - easy access to transit, and good local restaurants. Alex's room is quiet, comfortable, and has a great collection of books that could keep me entertained for quite a long time. Alex couldn't have been more accommodating - the key exchange was easy, and when I managed to lock us both out of the apartment (yay, me!) he was completely gracious about it. I'll be back next time I'm in Brooklyn!"
13394,7449976,20/9/13,2073675,Alison,"Alex was so accommodating - my stay was last minute and he generously improvised a key pick-up and other arrangements that worked for me.  The room was just beautiful - enormous and flooded with natural light, filled with bookshelves (of quality stuff, too) that made me feel like working or reading instead of going out to see brooklyn....But I did of course, because Fort Greene is a wonderful, relaxed place to stay with great eating and strolling to be done in the surrounding blocks. And Fort Greene park around the corner is delightful.  Although I didn't see Alex much he was lovely to briefly chat with.  Recommend to others without reserve."
13394,8188454,20/10/13,1467387,Ali,"I had the most amazing month staying at Alex's in Fort Greene.
The room Alex offers, is gorgeous and felt like home almost immediately, infact that was my experience of the whole apartment. Everything you need is there, it's on a gorgeous tree lined street with fabulous neighbourhood bars, restaurants, yoga and parks and the wonderful BAM about a ten min walk away.
I was so fond of Alex too, he is a caring host who makes you feel 100% at home and I really enjoyed seeing him when our paths crossed - he gave me great advice in things to do alongside just being a really great guy. I will be back for sure and can't recommend a stay here highly enough. "
13394,8465577,1/11/13,9140011,Sam,"I never met Alex, but had a really comfortable and stress free stay in his apartment. Very easy and convenient."
13394,8592713,6/11/13,9654783,Vicky,"This was quite a last-minute trip to New York, and Alex couldn't have been more accommodating and helpful.  The key pick-up was easy, and he gave me lots of helpful information about the nearest subways and taxi prices.  The apartment is in a lovely area in Fort Greene, a nice big comfy bed and spacious room.  I was out for most of my short stay, but it was always great to come back to at the end of the evening.  I met Alex briefly on my final day and he was very nice and charming.  I would certainly stay again."
13394,9217815,14/12/13,2714528,Jamin,My stay at Alex's was great! Alex is a super generous and thoughtful host. All the logistics were clear and simple. Apt is perfectly located and the room is cozy and nice! Highly recommend.
13394,9646256,4/1/14,9869591,Tom,"Alex was a great host! He was away at the time of our stay, but everything was well organized and went off without a hitch. We would definitely stay again!"
13394,9776284,9/1/14,6455308,Anna,"Alex was a great host and very good at communicating, he even  managed to arrange a check in despite of  his own flights being seriously delayed due to bad weather and storms.
The room is really spacious and facing a quiet street.  Sitting by the window in the morning, with my cup of tea, planning the day ahead became my daily routine, it was easy to feel at home.
I am happy I chose to stay in Brooklyn and at Fort Greene, on my first visit to NY, Alex´s place was good to come back to after my trips to (more noisy) Manhattan.
Oh, and there is a dream of a wine store on the corner, with organic wines and super knowledgeable staff. 
I would recommend Fort Greene and Alex´s place to my fellow travellers.
"
13394,10318081,12/2/14,11171903,Carl V.,"Alex's lovely brownstone in the heart of Fort Greene was the perfect place to stay in the neighborhood while I was hunting for my own apartment there. It's just steps to amazing dining (Madiba and Smooch Cafe) and unique shopping. A block or so from the trains into the city. Large, roomy and cozy during an especially snowy week. Alex was particularly hospitable to accept my last-minute booking, and when I left behind my iPad and shoes after leaving, he was nice enough to drive them to me. "
13394,11936524,19/4/14,589639,Synnøve,"This is basically a bargain. You get more than your moneys worth. The neighborhood is centrally located yet quiet and the room is clean, filled with light and is comfortably spacious. Alex is super friendly, super smart and super 
helpful. The spot is nicely located close to several subway lines which makes it easy to reach both Manhattan and other areas in Brooklyn, such as Williamsburg. I thoroughly recommend this spot for NYC visitor. That being said this probably gives most value to visitors who know the city and what to appreciate. "
13394,12099486,22/4/14,7953618,Rob,"Had a fabulous time in Brooklyn at Alex's beautiful home. Although Alex is frequently out, he made every effort to ensure our stay was both comfortable and enjoyable. Would easily stay here again, and recommend anyone else do the same!"
13394,12718207,9/5/14,1401755,Mark,"Fort Greene remains just the best neighborhood to stay in in Brooklyn.  Alexander's apartment is on the main (parlor) floor of a 130 year old brownstone. The room you stay in is what was formerly the parlor (which means it's in the front and is large) when this was, in long ago times, a one family home. It has been converted to an 8 family, but Alexander's apartment is very good size, with a large kitchen and bath. The queen size bed and pillows were very comfortable and my frequently temperamental neck gave me no problems. The stay was totally smooth, although Alex was not there as he was away on business. Highly recommended! "
13394,14012267,10/6/14,3958388,Eileen,"Alex has been a wonderful host - very communicative and generous with tips and information.  The apartment is exactly what the profile promises and completely wonderful in every way - perfect location, great value and very homey to come back to.  I can't imagine anyone would be disappointed staying here.
"
13394,15388195,8/7/14,3958388,Eileen,"I stayed at Alex's for 2 months and it was amazing ... fantastic location, safe, secure, beautiful and light.  It was like living on the set of every fabulous movie ever made about Brooklyn, only better!

Alex was a wonderful host, even though I only saw him for a couple of days while he was in town briefly before heading off to the World Cup in Brazil.  He made arrangements for a friend to meet me at the apartment when I arrived - I was late and Miki was super patient and gracious in waiting for me.  He was always communicative the whole time he was away - super thoughtful in sending me tips on things to see and do in Brooklyn and NYC - and left me a bunch of numbers for local contacts who could assist while he was in Brazil.

This was a fantastic place to stay - the location is superb, the communication with Alex effortless and the apartment itself is charming."
13394,15756555,15/7/14,15175924,Teri,We had a lovely stay at Alex's brownstone for an extended weekend. The apartment was perfect and located in the beautiful neighborhood of Fort Greene. It was the ideal retreat after long days of exploring New York. Alex was always available when we had questions and was happily forthcoming with suggestions for restaurants in the area. We had the apartment to ourselves as Alex was out of town during our stay. There is nothing like sitting on the stoop of a brownstone with your morning coffee. Beautiful.
13394,17100455,7/8/14,7863920,Joel,"This is a gem of place. I found it an easy to walk to the subway, loved having a park nearby to wander around, and there are a number of streets nearby with restaurants, bars, and convenience.

The street itself is lined with trees, and building has character.

The room is huge, and Alex is often travelling for work, so you may end up with the whole place to yourself, but if not then Alex is a really warm and friendly person that will make you feel at home. I'm a bit on the quiet side, but it didn't seem to bother Alex at all. Wish I had a change to take him up on opportunities to go out, but unfortunately the timing didn't quite work.

My only struggle was that there was some construction going on across the road during the day and I was doing some remote working, but there are places nearby to go, and the double glazed windows keep a lot of the sound out if it's a real issue (I preferred having the fresh air)."
13394,18083817,21/8/14,14450321,Rachel,The apartment was great and Alex was a fantastic host!
13394,19522553,14/9/14,5764803,Tom,"The room is really big and comfortable, and Alex was a friendly and generous host. It's in a really nice part of Brooklyn too, a minute's walk to Fort Greene Park and surrounded by cafes and restaurants. I really recommend staying here."
13394,24222003,23/12/14,16564777,Eugene,"It was all great; the arrangements for getting in (Alex was away at the beginning) worked seamlessly, and the flat was lovely in itself, and a wonderful base for exploring in Brooklyn and Manhattan (very handy both for walking and for subway system).  When Alex returned we were room-mates for a while, and we had some good chats about common interests.  I'd highly recommend this as a place to stay.  One thing that some people might be sensitive to is that the heating is controlled centrally so the individual room control is limited to opening or closing the window; a minor point, and it didn't bother me, but if heating is a bug-bear for you...

13394,26958849,22/2/15,1947858,Yuri George,"Alex was a superb host and made my stay very comfortable. Since he is a world travel himself, he knows exactly what a visitor needs to hit the ground running and what to look forward at the end of the day: an extremely comfortable bed, nearby bathroom & shower, kitchen -- all very tidy and clean -- plus a view of a beautiful Brooklyn street. You can't help feeling the building's history as well of the surrounding neighborhood. A few easy minutes to the subway and BAM. Great location. Highest recommendation. "
13394,28189744,19/3/15,28984473,Doug,As a first time user of Airbnb I had a very positive experience. Alexander is a helpful and friendly host. The apartment is lovely and in a great neighborhood. 
13394,29442165,7/4/15,2845298,Edgaras,"Great neighborhood and quiet street. The room is huge to NYC standards. Subways, that can take you anywhere in the city, are a walk away. I only met Alex one time to get the keys since he was traveling, but he was kind and helping me even while being abroad. Good place to stay!"
13394,30541474,24/4/15,23512371,Ian,"Stayed at alex's and what a brilliant trip it was. The house was great as was Alex. His place was a splendidly friendly place, very relaxed. The location is spot on in a great part of Brooklyn and subways into Manhattan are close enough to get either there or to the beach of Coney island in half an hour (or just walk into manhattan over the brooklyn bridge). There wasn't a single thing wrong with our stay."
13394,30864578,28/4/15,27995280,Robert,"Stayed at Alex's apartment and had a great time! Even though he wasn't there, he made sure every detail was covered and my needs were met. I highly recommend it!"
13394,31425027,5/5/15,26629841,Lizette,"Alexander was a perfect host, even though he was away while we where staying in his place. No problems checking in and getting the keys, and with any question we had, he responded very quickly. A great (quiet) place to get to know New York, with Manhattan close by metro! Lots of shops and restaurants around, a nice Bitter Sweet (recommended!), so, all considered, a nice appartment to stay! "
13394,31936406,12/5/15,26589902,Marlies,"We liked our stay at Alexander's apartment. Although he wasn't at home, he was a good host. The apartment is spacious and the neighbourhood just great! Good coffee in the street and around the corner. :-)"
13394,32273513,16/5/15,5039041,Elke,"Alex wasn't around while I was there, but he was a good host nevertheless: available and helpful. I could leave my bags at his place until the evening the day of my departure, which was very convenient. The room is beautiful, with lots of light. Great book selection and a comfortable bed. The neighbourhood is lovely as well: calm but lively enough, with some nice restaurants and shops around. Lots of subway stops in close proximity. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Alex."
13394,32730378,20/5/15,21852745,James,"Alexander was a great host, really easy to deal with, got to stay at short notice, the place was really awesome!

We didn't feel like we were just guests at his house, we definitely made a new friend! Alex has awesome NYC recommendations and just an overall great person to talk to. He was welcoming and made us coffee and let us have anything in the fridge. 
You're awesome, Alex. I'll be sure to stay with you again for my next visit!"
13394,35554918,20/6/15,14482320,Jussara,"Foi muito bom ter me hospedado com meu filho na casa do Alex. O quarto é grande e o apartamento oferece tudo o que precisamos. O Alex viaja bastante e ficou pouco tempo conosco, mas no período em que estava no apartamento foi bastante solícito, nos ajudou no que precisamos e foi muito simpático. A localização é muito boa, próximo a pelo menos três estações de metrô. As ruas são tranquilas e arborizadas. O apartamento é antigo, mas charmoso e limpo. Eu me hospedaria novamente com certeza e recomendo."
13394,43159221,17/8/15,7837285,Adnan,I was in kind of a bind needing a place to stay on short notice. Alex replied promptly and was very welcoming. 
13394,45276616,1/9/15,3251188,Ligia,"O Alex fica pouco em casa, me senti bem à vontade no espaço. Inclusive, para usar a cozinha. O bairro, é ótimo, eu já conhecia. Uma região ótima do Brooklyn, perto de estações de metrô, parques, restaurantes... ideal para quem busca qualidade de vida em NY.  O aprtamento é bem espaçoso e confortável. O Alex fala um pouco de português também... foi um ótimo anfitrião, bastante sociável e atencioso, mesmo quando ausente. "

Il nous a raconté l'histoire de fort greene et nous a aiguillé sur la vie culturelle de Brooklyn. Nous avons vraiment pris plaisir a rester ici. 

L'appartement est très bien situé ; idéal pour partir à la fois à la découverte de Manhattan et de Brooklyn ! Le quartier est très sympa avec beaucoup de bar / resto aux alentours. Nous recommandons vivement cet appartement et cet hôte ! "

Alex was extremely helpful in terms of prompt responses, flexible check in and out times and places to check out around the area. I'd highly recommend his apartment! Thanks, Alex!"
13394,48144348,23/9/15,43275321,Jasper,"Absolutely great stay. I've been coming to New York for more than 16 years now, but I have rarely seen a room as nice as the one Alex provides to his guests -- beautiful wooden floors and shutters, high ceiling, great library. The neighborhood, Fort Greene, is very pleasant, and the park is literally around the corner. Alex was very welcoming, even though I gave him only -very- short notice of my arrival. Crucially, he seems to really enjoy having guests over, which is important, as one is sharing the facilities (kitchen, bathroom) with him. I never felt I was 'in his space' or anything like that. Instead, we had nice conversations, even while he gave me my space and was out of the house most of the time I was there. In short, highly recommended.  "
13394,49038771,30/9/15,1989917,Mihai,"Alex place is located in a great neighbourhood with two nice coffee shops close by (""Smooch"" right down the street, and ""WTF coffee club"" on the next block which makes extremely good coffee!). The room is huge, with high ceiling, a good bed with a very comfortable mattress, the apartment is clean and the street is quiet at night. We just had a chance to meet Alex the first night and talk a bit over a couple of Pale Ale's. Besides english he parle francais perfectly. He'll tell you more...
He was really busy with the Pope's visit and UN council etc. plus we were out all day visiting NY and came back only late in the evenings. But we can recommend his place as part of your NY experience - it's definitely not an impersonal hotel room, it's not hyper modern, but you'll find lots of interesting books, art and personality."
13394,50950331,16/10/15,44754417,M,"Alexander est un hôte très sympathique, accueillant et généreux.
Très bien située dans brooklyn, avec une belle grande chambre propre et lit confortable, cette adresse est juste parfaite !"
13394,52842163,2/11/15,793279,Emanuele,"Excellent location, 10 minutes from different subway lines (B, Q, R, 4, 5, G). The neighborhood itself is really nice, with many cafes and restaurants and the feel of a real community. The room is really spacious and well equiped, with cool decorations and a lot of sunlight. Everything is clean. Alex was helpful and contacts with him (mails and phone, we didn't meet) were smooth and precise."
13394,66568686,23/3/16,61974115,Catalina,"La estadía en la casa de Alexander fue muy grata. La casa era cómoda y el barrio era muy lindo, un típico barrio de brooklyn. Está bien ubicada, a pocas cuadras de un subte y cerca también de estaciones de citybike. Durante nuestra estadía Alexander se encontraba de viaje, así que no llegamos a conocerlo en persona, pero fue muy buen anfitrión y se comunicó constantemente con nosotras para explicarnos todo y que nos sintiéramos cómodas allí. "
13394,69444512,11/4/16,58759058,Elizabeth,"The room was cozy, bright with natural light and perfect for our needs.  I was surprised at how quiet it was. The bed was very comfy and the room was clean and full of wonderful literature.   We very much enjoyed meeting Alexander and had time to get to know him a bit.  He's easy-going and flexible. We were attending a reunion at Brooklyn Tech HS, so the location was perfect for us and we found some small, lively, excellent restaurants within a very short walk.  A great experience overall."
13394,79079035,11/6/16,27836380,Danjo,"Fort Greene park is one of my favorite places in Brooklyn, especially before 9am when it's off-lease time for a legion of four legged creatures. A very fun part of my morning commute for my week of work. The room is plenty large with nice tall ceilings and amazing morning light through 2 tall windows. The room is sparsely furnished but has lots of books and enough space to store a week's worth of clothes(hanging and in drawers). The door to the room is a sliding door which doesn't do much for audio privacy but works fine visually. Host was easy to plan with. This room is on my short list for my somewhat regular work trips to the area. "
13394,86957560,18/7/16,19308999,André,"Alexander is a very nice person. He did everything he could to make my wife and I have a good time at his house. He gave us tips of restaurants, free concerts and museums. We talked about our jobs, our cities... It was a pleasure to know him. The neighborhood is safe and calm. Brooklyn is an interesting place to explore and the Alex's house is located in a strategic area, not far to the Brooklyn Bridge and 3 blocks to the subway. It was a good exploring experience because although we know some of Brooklyn, it was the first time we stayed over there. Amazing."
13394,90416259,1/8/16,15033553,Marius,"Cannot recommend enough! Such a beautiful area and neighborhood, plenty of things to do, easy commutes and a washer/dryer to boot. Stayed for a few weeks with my girlfriend and we had a great time here. Alex wasn't around but was attentive and quick to respond. A little hot in the summer months without the AC, but a few fans managed to keep us cool"
13394,98568914,31/8/16,10609290,Joshua,"I recommend saving yourself the headache and avoid staying at Alexander's place.

The problem isn't the place, but how Alexander deals with disagreement and in general his communication skills.  He not only refused to discuss the matter, but called me a series of names unpublishable here.  

In Alexander's advertisement, he wrote in his all caps, ""YOU'LL HAVE THE APARTMENT TO YOURSELF.""  Approximately, two to three weeks before I was going to stay, Alex emailed me to let me know that three different sets of guests may end up staying with me in a separate room.  

I noted to Alex that this was different than the advertisement.  I offered however that perhaps we could limit to two out of the three potential guests.  

Alex wrote back twice that it was ""not negotiable."" that  ""luckily for you, the apartment will be empty almost the entire time.""  Alex told me that he could have as many guests there as he wanted, and that he could come back anytime if he wanted to as well.  

At that point, I called AirBnB.  As a courtesy, I told Alex that Air BnB might call him.  He wrote back that ""knowing that the person staying there is not worthy of my welcome rankles me"", that ""he dreaded to learn of my true intentions.""  He added, ""I said your request was non-negotiable.""  ""What is my problem?""  

He called me his ""skittish prima donna guest from Bogota.""

He wrote, Truly I would rather not have dealt with you at all.""  

""Can we stop talking about this (cuss word).  You are getting 27 days on your own far more than I ever get - so just enjoy the solitude.""  

Air BnB called him and told him that I was in the right, to please modify his favor.  Alex told Air Bn B he wouldn't do so.  We settled the matter with Air BnB.    

I add that in my letters I was always polite to Alex in all my emails, rarely bothered arguing the point, and never responded in kind with aggressive or hostile language.  

Lastly, in general Alexander sends three to five emails to answer one simple question.  Four emails to say how to water the plants.  A lot of them are unclear and repetitive.  It just creates a lot of confusion and wastes time.  

The apartment is great and probably nothing will happen.  But if you do end up disagreeing with Alexander, even if you're clearly in the right and are still willing to compromise, Alex will overwhelm you with hostile emails.  

Why risk it?

L'appartement a tout ce qu'il faut, il est très bien situé dans Brooklyn (pas trop loin de JFK et à quelques stations de métro de Manhattan). Le bâtiment est un vrai brownstone très mignon. La rue est calme mais le quartier est animé pour qui veut sortir ou aller au restaurant.
Tout a été facile (check in tardif, check out à une heure qui nous arrangeait)
Je recommande vivement cet endroit !"

In addition to the opening windows, there are three fans for your comfort.  The location is great, friendly, and safe.  The bed was super comfortable and plenty big enough for two large people.  The bathroom and kitchen are very adequate and well-equipped.  Alexander was wonderful to work with and, even though he was not there very much during our stay, we shared a lot and he was most helpful in making our stay comfortable and enjoyable.  We will gladly stay there again."

Very good location in Brooklyn, very nice to take every day citybike (just arround the corner) to manhattan over brooklyn bridge in less than 20 minutes. The place is clean and I guess a typical way many people live in new york which is a nice change to the normal smaller hotel rooms."
13394,111909543,2/11/16,3154837,Patricia,"Alexander's room is just as described here, large, private and separate from his living space. The neighborhood is ideal, on a quiet street close to lots of grocery stores, restaurants, a great bookstore, places to see cinema, concerts and theater, and lots of convenient transports. Very convenient for both JFK and locations in Manhattan. 
From the moment I made the reservation, Alex was extremely helpful. He is often away traveling, but I was fortunate to meet him just at the end of my stay, because he is lovely company (also speaks French fluently). Very highly recommend!"

13394,146381546,22/4/17,27836380,Danjo,This is my second time staying with Alex. I love this place. Fantastic location for me. Old style charm. Fort Greene park is a magical park of Brooklyn. Alex is a wonderful host. Full of information and friendliness but also leaves you with plenty of private space. Nice green grocer and plenty of good restaurants a couple blocks away. A short walk to downtown Brooklyn where I was working for the week. A quiet residential street. A classic old yamaha keyboard for composing your next masterpiece.

Public transport is close by - you can be on the LES in 20mins - and (for women travelling alone) it's a nice safe neighbourhood.

The room itself is lovely, with a comfortable bed, space to work at a desk (if need be), and a view onto the street through a thriving balcony garden. Alex was friendly and helpful with the check-in process: even though my flight was delayed and he was out of town, everything went perfectly."

I felt like it‘s my place, the street is very quiet and green, lovely neighborhood w/ a lot of little charming places, restaurants, coffee shops. Close to DUMBO & 2 stops away from Manhattan - the perfect stay if you need & want a place to rest after work & enjoy the weekends out of the bubble. Beautiful charming historic district known for its many tree-lined streets and elegant low-rise housing. will be back for sure."

There’s a lot to do in the surrounding streets, including the farmer’s market on Saturday’s. The apartment is clean, comfortable, well equipped, and really felt like Home at the end of a long day. Alex is a great host, making great conversation, while respecting one’s privacy and not being intrusive or anything. This was really the perfect experience, and I’m definitely going to try to stay with Alex on my next trip to Brooklyn. 100% recommend."
13394,241291893,8/3/18,173366186,Elana,"Хозяин очень отзывчивый, все объяснит, расскажет. Но квартирка, как из прошлого века, очень колоритная, даже запах из прошлого века. Не хочется обижать хозяина, но лучше заплатить чуть больше, но жить в чистоте или хотя бы ближе к центру. Район, вы увидите, добраться можно, при желании, хоть куда. Но стоит все взвесить, плюс дорога, и сколько бы ты заплатил....Или может ты хочешь тихо и спокойно, и ехать никуда не надо."
13394,243581234,16/3/18,85896444,Sharon,Staying with Alex was super easy and the place is cozy and perfect for a trip to NYC-- the bed is ridiculously comfortable with plenty of pillows; the bathroom is well-stocked; the kitchen is clean and perfect for cooking  meals; btw if you are an art and literature nerd you will have a hard time prying yourself from the bookcase; and above all Alex is a gracious host. Fort Greene can't be beat for all the different trains you need to get around and this place is a short to medium walk to all of them. I will definitely be back next time I'm in town. Thank you Alex!
13394,254366899,16/4/18,8624738,Yannick,"I loved my stay at Alex’ place and intend to return.

It’s in a beautiful brownstone, very old but all in all pretty cool.

The decor wasn’t fancy but definitely quirky, the space offered was exceptional and a pretty good book selection for the lonely rainy days in :).

Alex is a great host, friendly thoughtful and always trying his best to make sure you’ll have the best from your stay. He travels a lot but even when he is not around he always touched base with me to check if I needed anything or if I had any problems.

Definitely a good place if in need of privacy too... really if you need a large room with good private space this is it.

The location itself is about a 10-15 minute walk from the closest stations which will get you pretty much anywhere in Manhattan... you are literally a couple stops away from downtown.

The area is safe and there are cool coffee shops and nice pop up restaurants and quiet bars if you choose to explore... right down myrtle avenue as well as Delkab.

Thanks Alex!

13394,301739144,4/8/18,206247271,Bernadette,"To all my fellow travelers and adventurers - look no further, Alex's place is the place to be in Brooklyn.

As a female solo-traveler, I travel with precautions. I look into the safety of the area, ask my questions in advance, and scope out the food and drinks near by. I want to have the best, safest, and most pleasant experience possible when traveling, as everyone hopes to have.

From the beginning, Alex was the first to respond to my inquiries out of the other hosts in the area. He was helpful, detailed and thoughtful in his responses to all my questions. His communication didn't end once I hit 'book', his helpful communication was constant throughout the trip. When I was trying to figure out how to get to EWR in NJ to his Airbnb, he provided me the exact route to take. Traveling, to and from the airport, and place to place was a breeze with his help.

Highlights that I think will help others:
-  Subway is a close walk; Lyft drivers readily available throughout all hours
- Beautiful & safe walk to Barclays Center in the mornings
- Cafe (vegan-friendly) right on the corner
- Place was clean; Room was prepared very nicely; bed was freshly laundered with clean laundry smell and had nice matching, coordinated sheets with lots of pillows
- Room is huge with natural light coming through the tall windows
- Neighborhood felt safe, looked beautiful

Alex was friendly and polite from the moment I met him. He gave me space throughout the whole trip. Since I'm a friendly person, I enjoyed engaging in conversation with him, and when I did it was always a great and interesting conversation.

There are so many more things I could rave about my experience. This was my first time using an Airbnb by myself. I told Alex he has set the bar high for all the other future Airbnb's in other locations I will stay at. This experience has also encouraged me to be more comfortable using Airbnb as alternative to hotels. I tell my family and friends all about my trip and they say I'm blessed and lucky because they've never had as great of an experience the one I had.

Seriously worth the book!

Marisa was extremely helpful in helping us navigate our stay in NY, provided us with umbrellas because of the weather, maps of the subway and her recommendations for restaurants and shops. She even interrupted her telephone conversation to help us figure out an alternate way to get to Manhattan, because the subway service on her L line was flooded due to the downpour of the preceding 2 days.
The apartment was clean, quiet and we had all the privacy we needed.
Several good restaurants and shops in the neighborhood and Marisa is eager to share her 20 years of information collected living in the area. Marisa seemed to share my passion for finding good inexpensive restaurants and the Malaysian restaurant she directed us to was excellent.
Marisa permitted us to leave our luggage at her apartment when we checked out in the morning for pick up later that day, so that we could spend one more day in the city.
I have no hesitation in recommending Marisa as a host."
13414,479199,27/8/11,924316,Alexander,"Marissa was wonderful host with great knowledge of the city, Williamsburg and how to save money on local attractions. (Very useful!) The room I stayed in was spacious, and the air beds were very, very comfortable. The location of the apartment is a minutes walk from Bedford Ave and  the subway making it a great location. There are lots of great shops, bars around! I would definately stay with Marissa again."
13414,531378,14/9/11,1002931,Sara,"Marisa was a lovely host, I would definitely stay with her again. The location of the apartment is great, and the airbed very comfy."
13414,559178,23/9/11,909027,James,"My girlfriend and I had such a good time staying with Marisa!  She is a brilliant host.  The apartment is great and in an amazing location.  Marisa is very friendly and helpful and her cat, Rusty, is quite a character!  Like I said, we had a great time, great conversations and were both really sad to be leaving.  Couldn't recommend her place more!!  Thanks again!"
13414,581002,29/9/11,1020667,Erica,"Highly recommended! We loved staying at Marisa's place. 
1. Her house is perfectly located in vibrant Williamsburg: easy peasy logistics to wherever, loads of places to hang out and superb people watching.
2. Marisa is super cool. She is a wonderful combination of laid back, funny, interested and interesting. Staying at her place definitely made our trip to NY more special. Otherwise we would have not only missed a car ride to colorful Queens, great Vietnamese food, the very impressive exhibition Detroit Disassembled, the beautiful Panorama (!). But also her view on things, her ridiculously laid back cat, her great 90s CD collection. It added much local and personal flavor to our first NY trip. A very happy experience! "
13414,631494,16/10/11,1129414,David,"Искренне благодарю Марису. Она очень коммуникабельна, так что ожидание неловкости быстро исчезло,  Очень удобное расположение- 2 мин от метро. Район хороший и добираться на метро до Манхеттена всего одна станция. Цена вполне разумная. Рекомендую оставаться.
Мы успели подружиться!

I sincerely thank Marisa. She is very sociable, so expectations of awkwardness quickly disappeared. A very convenient location- 2 minutes from the metro. The area is good and get on the subway to Manhattan is only one station. The price is quite reasonable. I recommend to stay.
We managed to make friends! "
13414,636909,17/10/11,1120762,Beth,"We selected this listing based on Marisa's reviews and they are accurate.  We love Bedford Ave and being located so close to the L train (one stop from Manhattan).  Marisa was a great host and very personable.  I wish we had more time to take her up on her suggestions for visiting Queens.

The apartment itself was ok as it was cluttered and could have been better kept.  But we had the living room to ourselves and primarily only slept there and the air beds were fine.  "
13414,651656,22/10/11,939275,Bridget,"We loved it here. During our stay, Marisa was good enough to give us the run of her spacious lounge room. Her apartment is cosy with great views of the city lights, and the location is killer -- right in Williamsburg's thumping heart and only one stop from Manhattan on the subway. But Marisa is the real selling point of this place; her quick wit, great conversation and amaaaaazing restaurant recommendations made this trip one we'll never forget. Oh, and Rusty is our new favourite cat. Thanks for everything, Marisa, we'll definitely be back. "
13414,660539,24/10/11,645624,Fredrik,Williamsburg is a great place to stay if you are visiting New York! And Marisas place lived up to the positive reviews. Very helpful
13414,671974,28/10/11,1316855,Joao,"Marisa is a fantastic host, warm and friendly, very knowledgeable about the city. Location couldn't be better, just one stop from Manhattan, 2 mins from East River Park that has gorgeous views over the NYC skyline. Also it's in the centre of the happening Williamsburg area (I just love it when you actually find what's advertised for)... Thanks Marisa & Rusty for a great stay!!"
13414,682065,1/11/11,283460,Nathan,Marisa's place is located in a great central area in Williamsburg. She's a nice and considerate host.
13414,696335,6/11/11,1267486,Ruth,"Esta ha sido mi primera experiencia en airbnb y al principio tenia algo de temor por como resultaría, pero gracias a Marisa lo volveré a repetir sin lugar a dudas y lamentandolo mucho por mis futuros anfitriones, siempre los comparare con ella aunque no quiera. Marisa ha sido increíble, la verdad, mejor que lo que esperábamos. Nos proporciono toda la información q necesitamos en cada momento, nos dejo espacio para nosotros, fue discreta y silenciosa y ni se notaba que estuviera. Muy amable, simpática, cercana y acogedora. Ojalá hubiéramos hablado mejor ingles para poder comunicarnos mas y mejor con ella. Y bueno, la ubicación del apartamento increíble. El barrio mola mucho. Y el apartamento en si super distinto a todo lo q haya visto antes. La verdad que solo tengo palabras buenas para Marisa y su apartamento. Si volvemos a NY seguramente le preguntemos si tiene sitio para nosotros y espero que lo tenga. Un beso Marisa!!!....y ya sabes, si vienes a España tienes cama!!!...jajaja"
13414,705984,9/11/11,1313677,Alicia,"My boyfriend and I originally booked to stay with Marisa for just a few nights but ended up extending because it was such a lovely place to be! Marisa is a great host - helpful and so friendly.  We also loved Rusty, the fattest cat we've ever met.  The location of the apartment couldn't be better - right in the heart of Williamsburg (as the advert describes), next to a subway which is just one stop from Manhattan. Highly recommended. "
13414,722544,15/11/11,1363923,Matthew,Great location right off bedford ave.  I loved the convenience of the location and highly recommend this place for travelers not wanting to pay high prices for hotel accommodations that you do not need.  This unit is simple and perfect for a place to sleep and store your bags at a great price.
13414,753935,29/11/11,1366718,Nicolás,"Located in a perfect spot within the nicest area of Brooklyn, we really enjoyed our stay. Moving to Manhattan was easy and Marisa was quick to explain us whether we needed anything. Directions, recommendations or whatever. 100% recommended."
13414,768472,6/12/11,1438226,Jesper,"My stay with Marisa was outstanding. She was a very friendly and helpful host, always generous with information, and consistently very quick to respond the any questions I might have had (be it via e-mail, text, or telephone), and equally so prior to my arrival, during my stay, and after that I had checked out, and that was something that I found very comforting when you are visiting a country for the first time. She made feel right at home in NYC. She is also a person of great intellectual resources, and if you show the least bit of interest you will have the opportunity to learn about life in general and about NYCs in particular. For me personally it has been very valuable to get to know Marisa, not least because of her ability to describe the political, social and historical background of much of what is going on in NYC. The apartment is located in Williamsburg in Brooklyn, one of the hippest neighborhoods in NYC (with lots and lots of culture, music, boutiques, vintage clothing, coffee shops, great little bars, etc. if your into that), and it is literally 2 minutes from the subway. Just hop on the L-train (subway) and you'll be in the heart of Manhattan within just over 5 minutes. The apartment is homy and got a lot of character, but don't expect it to be like a hotel with everything neat in order. But the toilet and bathroom were very clean and nice. You sleep either on an airbed or on the couch. And even if I worried beforehand if I would get any sleep on an airbed I was pleasantly surprised. Marisa was also very generous by providing you the privacy you might want. Moreover, the price is great, I mean really great! You won't find anything in this price range at a great location like in the heart of Williamsburg. So if you want to keep your costs down while in NYC, I can definitely recommend Marisa's place. And if you want to learn about NYC at the same time, It definitely is a great place to stay."
13414,782905,13/12/11,1355411,Janet,Location Location Location.  Marisa is a friendly host and her apt. is in one of my favorite neighborhoods.  
13414,1668714,9/7/12,2621521,Monika,Marisas apartment was a great place to stay during our visit in New York. We stayed for almost two weeks. Marisa is a very good and attentive host and she gave us great tips on things to experience in New York. We had many nice conversations with Marisa and felt us part of life in NY while staying at her place. The apartment is centrally located in Williamsburg and easily reached by the subway. The neighborhood is interesting with small nice restaurants in Bedford street. Highly recommended!
13414,2287326,14/9/12,3006152,Simona,"You couldn’t wish for a better address in NY. The location is perfect and Marisa is a superstar, ready to help in every possible way. Heartily recommended. "

i sleep on the sofa becouse i don't like air bed ., i will definitely go back"
13414,3271861,4/1/13,4513057,Andrew,"My girlfriend and I had a great time staying in Marisa's place in Williamsburg. It was clean and well-kept, and as described, very close to the center of the action on Bedford. Marisa was very responsive and had two sets of keys so we had no trouble coming and going.

It is the case that there is not a completely separate living space and that guests have to share a bathroom, but as Marisa is a great host, very considerate and fun to talk to, I still recommend her place to anyone looking for an Airbnb spot in the neighborhood. We had a great time and would definitely stay there again in the future!"
13414,4611630,15/5/13,278731,Jonathon,"I stayed at Marisa's place for several weeks which served as a base for me while I looked for work and settled into the New York way of life. 

This place is awesome mostly for the sheer convenience of its amazing location. Right in the buzzing hub of Williamsburg, but just off Bedford so as to not get too much of the noise. You have shops and eating a plenty. The Bedford ave subway around the corner, and being on the top floor ( I hope you like stairs) you have views of the Manhattan skyline.

Marisa is about as good as they come as a host. Great sense of humour, very communicative (she was in Chile on holiday during my stay but was always quick to respond to email) and full of info.

If you're looking for hotel style accommodation you wont find it here but you will find a comfortable base to help you explore this great city. Highly recommended. Thanks again Marisa and get well soon Eddie (Marisa's cat)!!"
13414,5120939,13/6/13,6674926,Gregoire,"Marisa is a realy nice person. Very helpful, she likes to talk about the city. Very interesting! Perfect location near the subway, many restaurants and bars around. The appartment is charming. I stayed in a sofa bed in the living room."
13414,9021774,2/12/13,1673818,Chiara,"Marisa was a great host. She was very nice, communicative and really quick to respond any questions we might have had.
The apt location is perfect, the subway station (Bedford Ave, just one stop to Manhattan) is just around the corner and the neighborhood has a very cool and young atmosphere. 
I would definitely stay at Marisa's again!"
13414,12198155,25/4/14,2183748,Kathrin,"This is my favorite place in New York. I stayed at Marisa's place for several weeks in 2012 and again in April 2014. The location is perfect, in a quiet street but close to the riverside, parks, and a lot of restaurants and bars. Marisa is just a great person, we had a lot of fun and good conversations. I really miss her. And Eddie, her awesome cat, too. Thank you so much and see you soon! "
13414,12515408,4/5/14,4105376,Luis,"I enjoyed my stay at Marisa's apt in Williamsburg. The location was ideal, and the space was quaint and suited my needs. She was great energy and presence, and definitely helps to make you feel at home in the space. Would definitely stay there again, and recommend to future guests."
13414,13048363,18/5/14,14889837,Jamie,"Marissa is a very good host and her cat is wonderful. Marissa is attentive to a guests needs, respectful and helpful. The area is great. It's three blocks from the East River Ferry and 1 block from the L train.  There's also lots of places to go out to eat and drink in the area.  The room is good sized and quiet. This is a good apartment if you're on a budget, want to be centrally located, and rent from a great person."
13414,45574288,4/9/15,1120418,Ann-Sofie,"Marisa's place is situated in the heart of Brooklyn. Easy access to subways and buses. The place is pretty big and has a lot of natural light. The best part was to get to know Eddie, the cat. The cutest cat! Marisa was a great host. Never got a chance to meet her but she was always fast to respond and very helpful. She has a lovely sense of humour. I would love to stay there on my next trip and hopefully then meet Marisa, a five-star host!"
13414,50852628,15/10/15,4473123,Danilo,"Great host, best location... Perfect stay! Communication was impeccable.
 Eddie the cat is lovely."
13414,52641959,31/10/15,12840169,Alina,"The flat is situated in the heart of Williamsburg, where all the little shops and flea markets are. It is also close to the station, and takes just 15min to get to Manhattan, which is great. Eddie (the cat) is also super sweet and nice, giving you so much love)

Marisa is also so so lovely. I wish there were more people like her.
"
13414,53578895,9/11/15,30749893,Eduardo,"Marisa's place it's awesome, very cozy and very nice to chill out after a NYC day. It's in the heart of Williamsburg, lots of places to brunch, eat or drink. It's very very near to Manhattan, just one subway station. You'll feel like home.
Marisa is a very nice person to talk to, she's a very cult person, interesting conversations and she'll tell you very nice stories about NY. Eddie the cat it's just so awesome too, so chill and cool.
I'll definitely come back here really felt like home."
13414,55123506,28/11/15,10909091,Kürsad,Marisa was a great host and I enjoyed my stay very much!
13414,58178192,1/1/16,27003235,Damir & Mediha,"We spent a few days in Marisa's flat just before New Year's. Merisa was friendly, very responsive and everything was like described. We had lots of nice conversations with her. We liked her cat as well!

Although we didn't cook much we had the full run of the kitchen and could have done without a problem. Merisa kindly let us use the condiments and other items like umbrellas when it rained :) . Marisa was also very helpful in suggesting sites and things to do. The area is very active and steps away from cafes, restaurants and the subway to Manhattan. 

The flat is small, functional and as described in the advert. Our room was large with a large futon and big TV. The room was heated well and was made to be very comfortable. No complaints.

Thank you for hosting us!

13414,93669406,13/8/16,28467162,Rui,"Marisa is just amazing, just as life itself. She is flexible, generous, and tells great stories =) I'll have to thank Eddie for being such a sweet cat. He is a fun and tough guy! I enjoyed my stay here very much in this airy, spacial, and artsy place! Plus, great location! Highly recommended."
13414,107142846,9/10/16,198355,Sophie Et Thomas,"Marisa is the best host and Eddie the best cat. Their appartment is lovely, with a perfect location right in the heart of trendy Williamsburg, with the very convenient subway station just around the corner. Definitely the perfect place to stay, and also a real pleasure to meet Marisa, who is a wonderful person!  "
13414,125013900,3/1/17,84854956,Moritz,"At first we can say that we really enjoyed our stay at Marisas apartment. Marisa is a really nice person. She was very helpful and had always good advices for us. Her little apartment was perfect for our needs. She welcomed us with a good glass of bear what we enjoyed together. In the morning we got her self made coffee wich was also really good. When it was raining she had umbrellas and little bags for us to take for our trips. We had always good conversations when we arrived at home in the night. What's really special about marisa's flat is the amazing view of the One World Trade Center. And of course not forgetting Eddie the cat, he might be the cutest cat ever. 

The surrounding area was exactly what we needed. Williamsburg is great and offers many places to go at night or for dinner/lunch. And most importantly, the subway station (Bedford Ave) is just around the corner and it takes only one Station to get to East village of Manhattan. So all in all it was a great trip to New York and Marisa made it even better."
13414,151610934,13/5/17,1295268,Nathan,"We had a lovely time staying with Eddie the cat at Marisa's apartment for eight days. The location is unbeatable! With the L just a block away and the East River Ferry just five minutes' walk there are always good options. And the apartment is surprisingly spacious. We didn't do much cooking but the kitchen had plenty of room and equipment for it, and the living room was a cozy refuge from the busy city. Highly recommended.

(A bonus for vegans - Vinnie's pizza, offering a dozen (!) different vegan pies, is just a block away, and Screamer's, an all vegan pizza joint, is only about a ten minute walk.)"
13414,169779155,13/7/17,49185767,Maryiah,"If you stay here it's almost the perfect deal with the exception of cleanliness. There's a train right around the corner and a bunch of food and night places on every block, but something that might make you want to spend a few more bucks for a different place is the lack of cleanliness. This could be easy to get around if you bring your own towels and linen. "
13414,185818717,22/8/17,10466402,Melissa,Our stay in Williamsburg at Maud's place was great. So affordable and fantastic location. 'Mr Eddie' is a wonderful host too!

She was great at communicating and setting up a smooth check-in process. Ran into a minor issue with opening the door, but Marisa was quick to call/text me to try to help me remotely. The apartment was incredibly convenient to public transit and was nearby a bunch of really amazing restaurants and store in Williamsburg. Perfect for a short trip in Brooklyn!"
13552,19594,7/12/09,47455,Amit,"perfect stay. just absolutely perfect. brian is a super nice guy. he made sure we felt at home, and even left us with some snacks and bottles of water. he was available for anything by phone/text, and also left us a list of helpful tips for around the area.

the area itself was super nice. not as touristy, so you get the feel that you actually live in NYC. but it is just one block from the subway station so you are a few minutes away from times square and all that, and on one night we walked from the subway station to the apartment at 3am with absolutely no fear. it was a great area, there is a pizza place across the street open 24hrs, and super cool shops all around.

the apartment is PERFECT. there were two of us and it was super comfortable. it really gives you the ""i'm living in NYC"" feeling. it was super clean. brian provided everything from towels to toothpaste. it was just real cozy and warm.

i could go on and on, but this was my first time using airbnb and the trip could not have gone any better. amazing host, perfect apartment, and great city.

thanks so much brian! i hope we will be able to stay with you again sometime."
13552,489208,30/8/11,1019345,Jay,"This was my first time using AirBnB, and it went great. The apartment was large for a studio (while still fitting the ""cozy"" title), nicely furnished, and in a great neighborhood. Everything was very clean; our host pre-stocked the refrigerator with food and the bathroom with soap, provided clean towels, and even had cookies for us.

Simple, easy, and comfortable experience."
13552,508626,6/9/11,932841,Sarah,"Charming Cozy Studio was PERFECT! My boyfriend and I stayed there for 3 nights, but we wish we would've booked for more days! It is located in a safe area with many restaurants and the subway station is within walking distance. After spending a night out in Time Square, we felt completely safe taking the subway and walking the two blocks to the apartment. The only thing we didn't like was the fact that there was a few flights of stairs and no elevator. The entrance was not very impressive, but hey, it's what's inside that counts! Brian was very personable and nice to communicate with and we only met him on day of arrival. He provided everything necessary from food and bottled water to clean fuzzy towels and soap. This was my first time using Airbnb, and fortunately I had a great experience and will most likely do it again! Choose the charming cozy studio and you won't regret it! You'll feel right at home!"

Brian was very accommodating from start to finish (even as our bus arrived late due to longer custom clearance and traffic jams on the way) and the apartment was exactly like advertised.

The location was ideal, although sometimes a bit noisy in the morning with lot of traffic coming by. The rest was perfect with everything near and the subway and Central Park just around the corner.

Definitely recommending Brian. Plus special kudos for having an Apple TV and high speed internet access! ; )"
13552,7626249,27/9/13,8181419,Dmitrii,"It was my first time using Airbnb and it went cool because to have deal with Brian was safe and easy. He is friendly, outgoing and honest host. The apartment is conveniently located - close to subway (lines 1, 2, B, D), next to Central Park, Lincoln Center, Museum of Natural History. Our staying in Brian's apt was nice. Despite the fact that it is an old house (sometimes it takes a few minutes to have a hot water), an apartment is comfortable, kitchen is small but functional (fridge with food, gas stove, lots of dishes), king-size bed with clean linens, high-speed WiFi, the bathroom provided with soap, toothpaste, shampoo, shower gel, clean towels, outside the windows was a bit noisy, but it's New York - a city that does not sleep:)) Overall, our stay was wonderful. The apartment feels like home. The Brian's apartment much easier and more comfortable than a hotel, and a definite plus - the price. If I have the chance once again to visit New York, I'd like to stay in this apartment. Thanks, Brian!!!"

The apartment and the amenities are exactly as described, we felt right at home!

The close points of interest as well as the short walking distance to the main subway lines made the studio a great starting point for exploring the city.

Highly recommended, would book again!"

Tous les métros sont à côté, ligne 1,2,3,R,Q,N... Central park à 5 mn à pied Time Square à 25 mn max à pied. Un bon plan, c'est très propre. Brian ne nous stress pas pour arriver ou partir. Nous n'avons pas laissé de caution et le ménage est compris dans le prix. Agréablement surpris. New-York étant une ville bruyante, le sommeil peu parfois être perturbé. En tous cas je vous recommande grandement cet appartement ! Thank you very much Brian :) !"

El departamento era muy lindo, bien ubicado, la ducha funcionaba perfecta con mucha agua caliente  y la cama es muy comoda. Todo muy limpio y ordenado. Excelente ubicación, cerca del metro, un barrio muy lindo, a una cuadra del central park. Brian nos trató muy bien, es muy confiable, siempre se preocupó porque estemos cómodos. Alquilar este departamento fue la mejor decisión que pudimos tomar! Y Brian es una ecxelente persona, esperamos volver averlo pronto!. Definitivamente recomendamos el departamento y a su anfitrion!"

The apartment is very cute and had just what we needed for the duration of the trip (2 weeks). It was clean and comfortable--we were provided with pretty much everything you would expect in a hotel (towels, wifi, etc). Public transportation was super close -- less than a 5 min walk away. Central park is about a 10 min walk away as well. There are so many restaurants in this area and it's pretty convenient to get to wherever you need to go.. My cousin lives on the UES and it was so easy to take the crosstown bus to meet up with her there. 

Overall, it was a wonderful experience and I would definitely stay at this cozy apartment again for a future visit! Thanks Brian :)"

13552,15946233,19/7/14,11354866,Leigh,"We stayed in Brian's apartment for 10 days and had a great time. The apartment is a perfect example of NYC inner city living. The Upper West Side neighbourhood is very friendly and beautiful with tree lined streets and awesome architecture. The apartment is ideally located a block away from a major subway station and the same distance to Central Park. There are literally hundreds of restaurants, cafés and bars within walking distance and we had no trouble and felt safe walking home late at night. The apartment building isn't the best example of architecture in the area but the apartment itself is fitted with all mod cons including fast internet and a functional kitchen (the gas was not working for our entire stay but with so many food options nearby we didn't care). Brian was responsive to all our questions and although we didn't meet him we felt welcome in the apartment. Overall the apartment is perfectly located and offers a genuine experience of NYC life."
13552,16880827,4/8/14,818090,Sara,"Brian responded so quickly that made it an easy decision to choose his place. He is so helpful and lovely. His place is so close to everything in a lovely part of the upper west side. So close to central park also. A great location to explore every where. Great size place for a couple. The bed is so comfortable. Would definitely recommend this place if you want to feel like a New Yorker over a tourist. Heaps of bars, cafes and restaurants all within walking distance. We loved this place and would stay again."
13552,32062007,13/5/15,9967144,Mélanie,"Appartement idéalement situé à côté de central park et de plusieurs stations de métro.
Commerces et restaurants a proximité !
Quelques points négatifs à noter : fenêtres en mauvais état, ce qui vous fait profiter de la circulation (plutôt intense sur l'avenue) des 5h du matin. 
Pas d'ampoule pour les lampes de chevet, dommage. 
Pour finir, nous avons pu faire quelques trouvailles sous le lit (chaussettes d'ex locataires, gobelets, bouteille...) 
Nous recommandons tout de même cet endroit surtout pour la situation!
Brian est un hote disponible et très sympathique qui a su nous arranger à notre arrivée.
Merci et à bientôt ! "
13552,32515551,19/5/15,29335833,Radivoje,"It was our first Airbnb experience...and what an experience.
Everything was close to perfect. It is an older building but we knew that and that was ok for us. Communication with Brian (we did not actualy meet) was excelent. Instructions we got were detailed and accurate, not a single issue. He was very responsive from initial contact until the day of departure. Flexibe as well.
Location of the place...fantastic, 5 mins to central Park ( The Dacota building is like 300m away), maybe 7 mins to subway...you can easily walk to Time Square.  Restaurants, bars, shops...everything is so close. And you will feel like at home here.
We had 5 amazing days in NYC.
Our thanks to Brian and Airbnb."
13552,32978925,24/5/15,27866104,Monica,"My boyfriend and I stayed for 6 days at this apartment, and overall our experience was wonderful. 

Brian was great at communicating, he was friendly and he made sure that we had everything we needed. I didn't meet him personally but he and his girlfriend coordinated everything perfect to facilitate the check-in and our stay in the apartment.

The apartment is exactly as described. It's cozy, clean, confortable and perfect for a couple. It is equipped with everything you may need during a trip. The location is great!!! It is very close to Central Park, Lincoln Center, Time Square, etc  It is also very close to grocery stores, delicious restaurants, cafés, bars, department stores, a little mall, etc. Public transportation is very close too, it is very easy to go anywhere. 

I would definitely stay at this apartment again for a future visit! Thanks Brian!

13552,35915621,23/6/15,30336409,Michiel,"The apartment was at a great location, 3 minutes walk to 2 different subway stations. and 4 minutes walk to central park. Supermarkets and bars are located nearby. The apartment is not very large, but definitely big enough for a pleasant stay. It is not the cleanest apartment, especially the bathroom.  Moreover, sometimes, the was no warm water in the shower. But all-in-all a very pleasant apartment. The apartment is equipped with a small kitchen with an oven, stove and microwave. The TV had HBO available which was nice to relax after a long day in the City. As everybody has previously mentioned, the bed is great! Brain was very pleasant to communicate with. We have never met him, but somebody else brought us the key. "
13552,37045279,4/7/15,31201599,Denis,"Avant l'arrivée, nous avons eu une très bonne communication écrite pour caler les détails. Malheureusement Nous n'avons pas eu l'occasion de faire la connaissance de Brian, néanmoins représenté par une charmante jeune femme. L' appartement est en effet très bien placé à deux minutes à pieds de central park. Petit bémol, l'endroit est peu isolé contre le bruit, important sur cette avenue. Brian a été très arrangeant quant à notre départ, nous laissant les clefs jusque tard dans l'après midi. Nous avons pu ainsi profiter de la dernière journée sans être encombrés de bagages."
13552,37739451,10/7/15,31001520,Rosanna,"We had a great stay in Brian's apartment.  It is in a fantastic location, within walking distance to many attractions and close to public transport, restaurants and supermarkets.  When arranging collection of the keys, his girlfriend was extremely friendly and understanding when our shuttle from the airport was three hours late.  It can be a little noisy at night with traffic and sirens sometimes waking us up for a minute or two.  Overall a very comfortable and enjoyable stay, thank you!"
13552,38392854,15/7/15,8375702,JP & Faen,"Very welcoming home, as described a cosy studio in Manhattan. Great value for money and a central location with easy access to transport. My only reason for less than 5 stars is the difficult operation of the shower which took a couple of goes to get the hand of. Otherwise highly recommended and the aircon was a godsend in summer. Thank Brian :)"

Brian was a good host and very good and quick at answering any questions, we could have concerning both the city and how to get to the apartment. Brian had provided sheets, towels and things like shampoo and toothpaste.
The only minus of the apartment was that it was not as clean, as one might could have hoped. As we only slept there and was out in the city all day, this was not too big a problem."

13552,49308793,3/10/15,26807089,Charles,This is a delightful small apartment in a perfect spot close to Central Park. On the third level it is on an intersection with a view of this busy and interesting neighbourhood. Brian was there to greet us and it was a pleasure to meet such a friendly and helpful host. Everything we could need was there and a couple of minor issues were fixed very promptly and unobtrusively. We felt it was our home in the city for the days we were there.  This small apartment which is for sole occupancy is excellent value for money and Brian as host was brilliant both keeping in touch with us before arrival and while we were there.

13552,50869854,15/10/15,44004314,Rick,"Brian was at the apartment to meet me, hand off keys and answer any questions I had.   He also made himself available for calls at any time during my stay and responded promptly, within minutes, on a couple of occasions when I sent text messages.   

The studio is in a great location, 71st and Columbus, and is walking distance to Central Park and several restaurants, stores etc on the upper West Side.  It is a perfect place for a stay in NY.  Studio was clean, bed was very comfortable, second floor walk up which was no problem. "

After a really warm welcome on our day of arrival by Brian himself we discovered a really cozy appartment. The room with bed, table and chairs was big enough for the two of us. The apt was clean from bathroom to kitchen to bedroom to hallway.  Everything you need for an easy time in NYC is present. In the kitchen you can cook your meals if you don't want to go out for dining. Fridge and toaster are at your disposal.  The location is more than perfect, close to two subway entrances and bus. Close to Central Park, shops, restaurants and further everything you need for a pleasant stay. "

The location is ideal with tube stations very close to the appartement that allow you to go anywhere in Manhattan and Brooklyn very quickly; supermarkets, Starbucks and bakeries...
Brian is very friendly and answered to our questions / queries very quickly. 
The kitchen has the basics and allowed us to lay back, cook diner before going out at night. 
I would recommend it without hesitation. "
13552,73907066,11/5/16,24556324,Walter,"Located at a convenient, elegant and nice neighborhood, Brian's apartment gave us the chance to enjoy Manhattan in full. Just a block away from both Central Park and several subway lines it was easy to reach fun within minutes. 
The really comfortable bed gave us the chance to recover from our exhausting strolls and rides around Manhattan. 
Although there's little room to place your belongings (and extra wardrobe would help a lot)  and the faucet needs some improvement (I guess,  through Brian's words, it's not so easy), Brian's apartment is absolutely convenient. 
Besides,  Brian is an excellent host,  really kind and very communicative as well as efficiently organized. 
Whenever we came back to Manhattan we""d certainly book this apartment again.

13552,104218984,25/9/16,54022285,Annik,Brian's apartment is great to explore NYC. It is big enough for two people and you find everything you need there. It is clean and cozy. We loved staying there.

13552,115410756,24/11/16,10038419,Justin,Brian is an awesome host and has a cozy apartment. He went above and beyond to ensure it was an easy check in and a comfortable stay. I can't imagine a better value staying in the City!
13552,116329514,29/11/16,289688,David,"Brian started texting with me the day before I even set out for NYC. We used the Airbnb site, then the texting, and then finally a quick telephone call--all on his part to make sure I knew that all was fine at his place. 

When I arrived, he patiently helped me set up the WiFi and showed me how to use the TV, loaded with Netflix, Hulu, etc.  Only when he was convinced that I knew everything was operational did he leave. 

The more I stayed in the place, the more I realized how fortunate I was to be in the location. The lower 70s in Manhattan are chockful of restaurants as well as a neighborhood grocery. Lincoln Center is literally 5 minutes away. I quickly grew to love ""my"" local coffee place, ""my"" wineshop across the street, and the incredible ease of being one block from an express subway station to anywhere. (Hint: Buy the $20 Metro tkt and be done with it. )  

I also loved sitting at the desk and looking out onto the street, during the day and during the evening. I was there at Thanksgiving, so I watched the Northeast tree farmers set up their Christmas tree stands at midnight on Thanksgiving.  Those images are ones I will recall for a long time--and take me back to the cozy studio, without hesitation."
13552,116778756,3/12/16,4089142,Paul,Brian is super welcoming and explained everything really well.  There's also a wash/fold place right around the corner that made my trip just that much easier.
13552,117340961,6/12/16,48522969,Kayla,"This was our first time using Airbnb and we were pleasantly surprised! When we arrived, Brian was there to greet and show us all the details of his studio and give us all the information we needed to enjoy our stay. He had already given us his personal cell number just in case we needed anything throughout our stay. When we opened the door it instantly felt like home. Very clean, he had fresh towels folded for us on the bed and everything in the kitchen that we would need. The location was perfect! The studio was very close to Times Square and all the hustle and bustle, but still far enough to give that homey feel. We particularly enjoyed the market that was right downstairs. I would recommend Brian's place anytime and for any occasion!"

Also I really need to give an special thanks to our host Brian, which did many things that for us were unexpected but we are really grateful for, like contacting us the day before check-in to know if everything is allright, waiting for us at the subway for showing us the apartment, being flexible with check-in and check-out hours and he even dropped us in Penn Station by car!

Thank you for everything, it was an amazing stay and we felt like locals for the weekend."

The sheets were clean and the shower was warm, and Brian provided us with enough towels to use :) Thanks so much for taking our luggage up and down the stairs Brian👏🏻 We would definitely come back to stay! (The only downside was the slightly open window that wouldn't close :/ But the bed was super comfy and warm we didn't feel cold at all! :))"

If you want to stay in NYC we would definitely recommend Brian's apartment."
13552,125747049,7/1/17,9782019,Nevena,"My bfriend and I had a great time at Brian's place. Checkin and communication with Brian was so smooth, and he was very helpful. The apartment is how we expected an old new york building to be like. We used to live in nyc and staying at his place was definitely very authentic experience. We had a few issues with the windows/heating but Brian was so helpful and quick in finding a solution. The flat has absolutely everything you might need! From maps, guide books, netflix, umbrella, plenty of towels... And that was lovely! 
The only thing we didnt like so much was the bed/mattress, way too soft of the type that make you sink in. So we ended up putting the thin top futon spongy layer on the floor after the first night. No biggy, but could be easily improved."
13552,129810021,2/2/17,110903726,Darby,Fabulous Apartment! Would highly recommend for any travellers headed to NYC. Brian is a wonderful host and went above and beyond in answering all of my questions prior to coming to the city.

13552,135627533,5/3/17,107595461,Christianne,Cosy apartment but has everything you would need for a single traveller or couple. Heating was quite hot but have air con to counteract it. Only negative would be if you have a bad back as bed is quite small for two people and not very supportive. Host is fantastic very easy to deal with and quick with communication.

The neighborhood his real clean and safe. Its location is great real close to everything. Avoid the corner store if you can cause its really over priced. Thanks again brian."
13552,144682052,16/4/17,68250256,Oscar,"The place is fantastic, a block from the park and a subway station and really close to everything worth to visit in NYC. The studio is truly a cozy place and Brian is a great host; you really feel at home. In the morning a fresh juice to start the day at ""Joe and the Juice"" is literaly a cross the street, just beside ""Ella"" which is a great place to have a drink at night. All and all an amazing stay."

The appartment is very cosy and you find everything you need.
Brian is great. He gives you a feeling like being at home from the first moment you step into the appartment. If you have any questions - no matter what kind of - he is there for you with his support. 
We can warmly recommend this appartment.

Brain was very helpful during the check in process. Very friendly.

Only complaints, both minor, are that the street noise was loud (expected in NY) and that the shower was difficult to get a good temperature. However, there was no shortage of hot water!"
13552,162875515,22/6/17,14867551,Arshkit,Really enjoyed (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with him was great and he made our stay very comfortable. Location is very central and the unit has all the needed amenities. Won't hesitate to stay here again.

Brian greeted us in person when we arrived, showed us the place, offered a few friendly tips, made sure we knew he was available for anything we needed, and then left us to our own devices.  I travel to NY regularly, and hope to stay at Brian's place often. Thank you!"
13552,164795193,29/6/17,136411969,Richard,"Brian's place couldn't be more conveniently located.  1 block from the subway, in the middle of the Upper West Side.  The apartment has everything you need and is comfortable to stay in.  The bed was super soft - I do see how 2 adults would be cozy in it though.  If you don't want to spend money on expensive restaurants, the kitchen is stocked with everything you need to cook there.  I would stay there again."
13552,165359818,1/7/17,8153211,Simon,Brian was really helpful and communicative prior to checkin and met us in person to talk us through the place. It was really ideally located for our visit to NY and hope to stay again in the future. Highly recommended!
13552,166769860,4/7/17,126164822,Sarvani,"This is a great place to stay if you're looking for something affordable, in a great location, with enough supplies and amenities, and a great host! Brian was very friendly, timely, and flexible! He greeted us when we arrived, showed us around, and offered several suggestions for restaurants, bars, transit, etc, which was super helpful! The studio was very well decorated, and he had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. It is in an old building, so 1) it doesn't have an elevator, and 2) the shower was a bit difficult as the temperature was unpredictable, and the water flow was not super fast, but it was still effective enough to clean ourselves, and the running water works fine otherwise. We also didn't have a lot of luggage (just two backpacks) and we spent most of our time out and about, so we didn't need anything fancy. The location was perfect, as it was not in the heart of Manhattan where there would be a lot more crowds and noise, but it was also not remote at all...right next to Central Park, a couple of Subway stations, and several great restaurants and bars within walking distance. I highly recommend Brian's place!"
13552,168510493,9/7/17,20148908,Misako,"He greeted us very kindly. And the room was very pleasant with a very clean and comfortable .

13552,173077575,22/7/17,47224207,Damian,"18 July, 2017
Brain was an exceptionally accommodating host.
Location far outweighs the age of the building.
Proximity to subway, Central Park, banks, general shops, etc. made the stay perfect for our needs.
Not suitable for a less mobile couple due to stairs. Extras all there including kitchen items, WIFI, Netflix
and a pocket guide to NYC. Thank you."

13552,180108271,9/8/17,34137330,Thiago,"This was my best experience in air bnb ever!!!

The place is bigger than it seems to be. The kitchen is properly equipped, the room has a comfortable bed and an excellent decoration with pin up pictures , books and maps, besides a working desk  and an apple tv device so you can enjoy your streams content providers as hbo, netflix and YouTube.

it's important to mention he provides linen, towels and amenities as shampoo, hair conditioner, liquid soap, toilet paper, hair dryer, and there are empty drawers where you can keep all your clothes and stuff.

Is very, very, very well located. One street from central park, one station or 3 minutes from time square (using express subway lines 2 and 3) and four stations or 12 minutes by local subway lines 1, B and C.

The infrastructure around the apartment is fantastic: there are Duane reade, trader's Joe, papaya, dunkin donuts, McDonald's, a lot of bars, cafes, restaurants, shoe stores, pizzeria, and all you can imagine NYC can provides... everything just around the corner.

Brian was an amazing host, waiting for us and attending our early checkin request. He gave us all necessary instructions and we did not need to contact him even he being available all time because the stay was perfect with no problems and I'm sure if any problem come out he'd help us properly.

If you're planning to go to New York in up to 2 persons, do not hesitate and get this place as soon as possible.

Thank you Brian and  I wish a good trip for the next luckily guests."

Most of the time we didn't need either as most things we wanted were within walking distance.  The apartment had everything you could possibly need and although compact was a perfect space for our stay.  Brian was very flexible with our check in and check out times and made himself available at any time we needed help but we didn't need any because he was so well organised.   There is a huge array of eateries nearby and also supermarkets if you want to eat at home.  Central Park, a TKTS booth at Lincoln Center, the Riverside Park, the list is endless.  Nothing is too far away, it's a perfect location for everything."

The bars and restaurants are frequented by locals which really added to our New York experience! The apartment itself is clean, tidy and very comfortable! Brian was very friendly and extremely accommodating! We can't wait to return!  "
13552,210111682,7/11/17,129581282,Susie,"Brian is a fantastic host - he was there when we arrived, showed us all the little quirks of the place, and gave us some tips on where to go. I was running the NYC Marathon, and I can't imagine a better spot to stay - I literally stumbled just over a block from the park exit and was ""home"" after the race. The apartment is cozy and clean, with all the amenities we needed for our stay (but bring a hairdryer if you'll need one!). And of course the location is great even if you're not running a marathon - convenient to subway lines, close to a ton of great restaurants and bars, and right in the heart of the Upper West Side, which is probably my favorite Manhattan neighborhood - plenty to do, but relatively low key. I will definitely try to stay there again if I have the opportunity."

The only thing was that the shower was pretty touchy (going from hot to cold suddenly), but Brian warned us about it beforehand and was very apologetic. We felt like we got a real New York city experience there. Brian was a great host!"
13552,218414977,12/12/17,29289239,Harvey,"Brian was quick to respond to any questions, and kindly helped me by bringing my suitcase up the two flights of stairs (he’s younger & stronger than me!)
Very nice, clean apartment, great neigjborhood...
The only negative is the shower, a bit tricky to maintain pressure & temperature. Other than that, this was a very nice stay!"
13552,220492702,22/12/17,92315892,Tanja,Brian hat uns sehr herzlich begrüßt als wir in seinem Apartment ankamen und uns gleich noch ein paar praktische Tipps für NYC gegeben. Wir haben uns dort in dieser Woche sehr wohl gefühlt und konnten auch jederzeit fragen (mit schneller Antwort) wenn wir etwas brauchten. Die Wohnung ist Nähe des Central Parks gelegen und mit der Subway auch sehr schnell zu erreichen. Zur 5th Ave oder zum Times Square geht man ca. eine halbe Stunde zu Fuß.
13552,223610423,1/1/18,66916445,Maggie,"This place is in a great location! 20 mins walk to time square, train is 2 blocks away and takes you everywhere!! Would come again!"

But I can’t say that I would stay there again because it’s nearly impossible to have a consistently warm shower. It would go from freezing to boiling without being touched. This may not be a big deal to some, but it was tough for us. 

Everything else was great, Brian was nice, he gave us our privacy and answered any questions I had. It’s perfect walking distance to the Subway and Central Park."
13552,230227496,27/1/18,3813940,Wendy,"Brian is a wonderful, thoughtful, friendly and communicative host. His place is well located on the Upper West Side, with restaurants, the subway, and Central Park all within a short walk. The apartment is clean and quite spacious, and suited my needs well.

The bed was very smooth, hot shower, mellow towels, beverages in the fridge. 
I hadn't realised that the place would be noisy, as this is Columbus Avenue, so for those that are not used to it, I'd recommend you bring ear plugs. The place is very close to Central Park, so easy to go for a run from there.
This is a very old building but the flat is nicely maintained and fitted."
13552,233218519,8/2/18,5126361,Elena,"Sunny little studio in the best residential neighborhood in New York, walking easily to subways, supermarket, Central Park, and Lincoln Center. It's pretty simple, but has everything you would need and is decorated nicely. The bed is very comfortable too. The studio faces Columbus avenue, so if you're not used to NYC, bring earplugs (was not a problem for me, though), but otherwise the building is very quiet and relaxing. Lots of places in the neighborhood to go out/ to eat as well, from quick to fancy."
13552,234889165,14/2/18,66379345,Josefina,"Brian’s place was perfect for a 5 night stay in NYC. Clean, equipped, and the location was perfect!

The location is literally one of the best in NYC - ready access to Central Park, shopping, lovely Upper West side neighborhoods, and one of the express stops on the 1,2,3 subway lines at W. 72nd St.  We are return visitors, and expect to be coming back often.

13552,279448633,20/6/18,43275184,Marcos,"My wife and I stayed at Brian's place for 8 nights last June. Although the apartment is in an old building (which is something to be expected in New York City), the location is absolutely great! You're two blocks away from Strawberry Fields in Central Park and pretty close to the American Museum of Natural History. Subway services 1, 2, 3 are also within walking distance.
This is a stylish, well-maintained apartment, with all amenities you may need, and the host promptly replied to every message I sent him.
The only downside I can think of is the shower. The water pressure is low and we couldn't take a shower without constantly adjusting the knobs for water temperature, which varies a lot for no apparent reason.
As for everything else, our stay was amazing and we'd recommend this place to other travelers.
Brian is a super friendly guy too."

My past trips to NY have been very short-two days at the most-, so I would stay just in Manhattan, but Brooklyn was new to me. Their place was quiet, eclectic and fun. The room I got was perfect for me, and I loved the Indian bed that became mine for the few nights I stayed there. Thank you JT and Tiziana! "

This family is able to recreate the past on their walls and feed their house with their personal soul. and beliefs.
Humanity, culture, openmindness, respect and simplicity are the words I would use if you asked me to describe our hosts.

Guest will be provided with all the essentials equipments like lots of towels, blanket and so (Website hidden by Airbnb) you don't have to be worry.Most of the rooms are provided with electrical utensils like water heater, microwave, toaster or even iron for your convenience. 
Her house has a lot of books, pictures,beautiful painting and artistic piece that you might enjoy.
Tippy's apartment is extremely close to the subway, hence it's easier for us to go to Manhattan with high frequency trains even in the late nights.
There's a lot of groceries and several restaurant like McDonald's, Asian Food or Halal Food for Muslim near the housing area.
I would recommend this to everyone who want to have an affordable stay but in the mean time comfortable place like a home for your vacation!
Highly recommended."

JT and Tippy as hosts was nothing but great, they helped out everytime we needed direction, advices, computer and they called us a cab the last day so we could be at the airport in time. We could step in and out the house anytime we wanted aswell. Overall I'd like to say that it was perfect!"

i had a great time, the apart is really nice and clean.
we had kitchen use, which was a big add cuase we did not have to depend of restaurants.
the bathroom was clean.
the location of the flat is ok, but probably not your best bet if you are planning to go back and fro manhattan.
Tippy herself was really nice and helpful.
definitely gonna come back."

Tippy and JT were really nice hosts so were the cats. Big bathtub, just be careful with the handheld showerhead. The subway is around the block.  It takes about 25 mins to get to Penn Station on the ""C"" Train, not bad at all. Plus there is free street parking in the area. I was hoping to see Spiderman swing through :-) You also get free wi-fi around the house.

Tippy sent us a box of chocolate for just a slight inconvenience, and JT saw us off personally even we had to catch a flight on 5 a.m. The house was decorated with interesting artifacts and even if the blue room was slightly older than it looked, it was still quite comfy in every other way. My only complaint might be the exclusive (beautiful!) bathroom which was equipped with a tub but without something to hold the sprinkler. Maybe i should've asked the host about it.
Anyway, i will definitely recommend it!"

The sheets on our bed weren't clean when we arrived but our (very friendly!) hosts immediately gave us fresh ones when we told them and they even put chocolate in our room the next day, which we thought was a nice gesture. However, the mattress is kind of worn and the bed sags in the middle. There also seemed to be a problem with the electricity because the power went off as soon as we turn on the lights, air conditioning and hair dryer at the same time - this happened 3 times but our hosts were always there to fix it.

All in all, we had a fantastic time. The hosts are very nice and welcoming, the neighborhood is nice and the subway is just around the corner!"

13808,2811540,5/11/12,3812897,Theresa,"JT and Tippy were really nice hosts. We took the blue room for 2 plus bathroom, both are as described and shown in the photos - really nice and lovingly arranged! The cuddly cats are great! Tippy and JT helped out every time we needed direction or information, they were great. We arrived very late (about two hours later than we thought) but this was no problem at all, Tippy waited for us to come. The house is full of culture and books - I loved it. Unfortunately we were in NY right when the hurricane came. The subway wasn't running and it took us all days about 1,5 to 3 hours to get the single way to Manhattan from their house. 
Unfortunately, the mattress is worn. And we first didn't know how to use perfectly the tub without something to hold the sprinkler in the bathroom but we arranged finally. ;-)
Very nice place, I definitely would go there again! It's a really nice place to stay and hang out."
13808,2825229,7/11/12,1872374,Jeremy,"Just got back in town today from our trip. We stayed at JT & Tippy's for one night, right after the hurricane-slash-superstorm Sandy messed up the coastal areas and took out electricity around NYC. The house was inland away from the worst of it and everything was safe and sound in their neighborhood, and actually very quiet. They made us feel right at home, even pulling coats and scarves out of the closets to make sure we were bundled up for the weather. As sundown approached, we got caught up in the height of rush hour trying to get back for our bags. Running very late, JT got us a cab and out the door in 3 minutes and delivered to JFK in perfect time! Everything worked out and our hearts managed to slow down once we got checked in. But at least we got a great story to tell. "
13808,3079477,12/12/12,4264019,Stefanie,"JT and Tippy were my very first Airbnb-hosts, and the experience couldn't have been better! I had a wonderful room in their really lovely brownstone full of atmosphere and beautiful things. 

The house having its own spell would yet be nothing without the people who live in it. Specially Tippy was very welcoming and supported me in every way. She kindly invited me to their vivacious  Christmas tree ceremony and proved strong nerves in helping me find a further host for the last days (their place being already booked). It turned out that we have a lot of interests in common, and I would have loved to have more time for talking. Not to be forgotten the cats, 4 lovely ladies, who always care for a cozy moment with inclined visitors. Thank you so much all of you for this wonderful experience!   
"
13808,3336255,13/1/13,3458477,Ginny,"Love love love! JT and Tippy were great hosts and we felt just at home! The house was filled with beautiful things (not forgetting the cutest cats on earth, play with Sophia - my personal favorite!), definitely one of a kind. Tippy was especially welcoming - she showered us with gifts during the holiday season and also let us receive mails and packages via her home address which was really nice! The guest kitchen that was made available to us was perfect as it was fully-equipped and stocked (Sophia came in often to watch us make supper, she's so cute). A couple of things to note, the bed is really old and yet to be changed, and the bath tub has no shower curtain (because there is no way to install one, it is meant to be a tub). It also bothered me a little that the curtain in the bathroom does not fully cover the area of the window. But these matters were small, and my boyfriend and I were able to get by perfectly fine! We had problems accessing the house wifi a few times but Tippy responded to our needs very quickly. We had the best brunch over at Peaches restaurant while staying at JT and Tippy's - highly recommend!! Anyway, I really loved staying there and it felt like a home away from home. Thank you for having us JT and Tippy, all the best!!!"
13808,4388206,2/5/13,4582993,Tess,"Tippy and JT are two truly impressive and kindhearted people, and  are the best hosts one could wish for. Their home was a sanctuary for us  over our three month stay in New York, during one of the coldest winters the city has seen. We quickly felt completely comfortable and cared-for in their home, sharing breakfast together one morning soon after we arrived, lunch in chinatown, coffee and chats in the kitchen and late night catch ups in the lounge room. I always felt comfortable to drop in on Tippy downstairs to ask her a question – which often turned into a great conversation, eventually ending in me being ushered out by the most gorgeous landlady ever, only to realise I'd forgotten to ask my question! Their place is old, grand and homely, with four cats lolling about in the lounge room, on the staircase and in the kitchen just waiting to have their head scratched. The room we stayed in (the blue room) is very generously sized, with a huge walk-in wardrobe space, a big cupboard for storage, a lovely big bed, a couch, a dining table, dresser, and still enough room for two people to lay out yoga mats and have a morning stretch on the floor. The house is in a great neighbourhood, with a strong sense of community. The local cafe (The Pantry) was like an extension on the lounge room for me, and Peaches Restaurant around the corner an irresistible weekend brunch spot with live jazz and a totally buzzing energy. When I return to New York, I'll be making a bee-line for Tippy and JT's place."
13808,5120349,13/6/13,6635154,Jen,"I booked with JT and Tippy the first time I used AirBnB and had a fantastic experience!

"
13808,7344475,16/9/13,8424929,Paola,"I stayed with my boyfriend at JT and Tippy's in the blue room for 5 days. The house has a very particular and warm design, the room is big and the bed comfy. Tippy was very kind and available. We checked in very early in the morning 'cause our flight landed before 6am and she welcomed us and was responsive in keeping in touch all the time before that moment. We had a whole bathroom for us at the same floor, very colorful and relaxing. A couple of cons may be the wifi network in the room, not working amazingly and the bath tub not very comfy for showering but I definitely recommend this airbnb. The subway is very close, less than 5 min walking. The neighbourhood is not that charming but it's fine. Thank you for hosting us! "
13808,8216513,21/10/13,8711117,Bibek,"Had a great stay in New York in this characterful brownstone in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn.  Very good instructions on getting to the house on arrival (arrived in the evening, NB actual entrance quite unobtrusive, with ivy over one side).  Tippy also kindly sorted out cab booking back to the airport on departure.  Excellent transport links once there make this an excellent base from which to explore Manhattan and Brooklyn.  Was so busy doing this I didn't get time to talk enough to Tippy, which was clearly my loss.  Ah well, there's always next time, would be delighted to stay there again.  "
13808,9276233,17/12/13,10098106,Theresa Anna,"My friend and I needed a place in new York for a  long weekend. Tippy's place was perfect. Quiet , warm and inviting. Tippy is a lovely person. Very friendly and ready to help with any questions you may have. I loved the little quiet neighborhood and the subway was a block and a half away. The room and bed were very comfortable and very clean and very spacious . The kitchen had everything you could possibly need. Great environment and when I go back I would stay at Tippy's again.!!!!"
13808,11403505,1/4/14,12421192,Kaylen,"Lovely space, lovely people, lovely cats. We stayed for a full month and enjoyed living here. The subway two blocks away makes everything accessible, the kitchen is well-stocked, and Tippy and JP are ever-gracious hosts. HIGHLY recommend. "
13808,12133130,23/4/14,765360,Court,Thank you so much for letting us stay in your lovely home Tippy and JT! It had everything we needed to get out and explore NYC. Was wonderful talking to you when we saw you. A fun and very memorable part of our honeymoon. 
13808,12909966,13/5/14,14503471,Monet,"I am super late with responding but Tippy was A-mazing!!! When I first arrived it was cold and I was ready for summer wether coming form New Orleans, but she went out of her way to help me find warm clothes since I had none, gave great recommendations for food, and was really like a mom away from home! I absolutely adored my room and everyone that stayed there was nice. I made some really good friends there and hope to come back! 

Oh,  and the cats! they were so sweet and loving! "
13808,14270593,16/6/14,6259601,Laure,"The bedroom Was amazing,Close to the subWay !! A lot of shop around !!! I adviise everybody !!! Very Great moment In this house "
13808,29748672,12/4/15,28766838,Jamie,"We had a very pleasant stay in the blue room. It has a genuine and romantic atmosphere, which makes you feel at ease. We would certainly recommend it. We loved the cats, especially Olivia. Tiziana called a taxi for us at the end of our stay. Thank you for that!"
13808,32950832,23/5/15,13802098,Sheila,"In One word great house, beautifull room, very kind and warm people and a great Location in town. So: its perfect! "
13808,33676572,31/5/15,30851334,Saverino,"Tiziana e JT sono molto accoglienti e disponibili per ogni richiesta di informazione e supporto turistico per chi visita la città. La stanza grande, il bagno e in generale la casa corrispondono alle aspettative e alle foto e descrizioni. Il quartiere e tranquillo, ben servito sia dai negozi che dalla metropolitana. I gatti di Tiziana sono molto discreti e coccoloni.  In complesso siamo stati molto bene."
13808,49181206,1/10/15,6972245,Nadya,Overall positive experience in nyc - beautiful house with cats in a quaint neighbourhood. Great hosts- JT has travelled everywhere - speak to him to know more. Thank you for the stay!
13808,55353937,1/12/15,27446878,Marianne,"JT and Tippy are such gracious and considerate hosts. We felt very at home in the Blue Room and had plenty of storage for all our stuff (and we had a lot of it). It was so nice to have a kitchen to cook in and cats to play with, especially the little calico! Their home is beautiful and full of fascinating details from around the world. It's on a quiet, lovely street very convenient to transportation, laundry mats, coffee shops, and restaurants."
13808,57708192,28/12/15,24637437,Niha,"The host made us feel very welcome. They were warm and homely. We chatted at length with both of them. The house is old an provides a unique experience I havent had before. It felt royal and antique. 
The host was very understanding and let us store our luggage there before check in time, and let us check out later than required.
We love animals, but, we werent prepared for the strong pungent cat odor that permeates the building. The only day it wasnt there was when the host had the windows open.
An extenuating situation occurred during our stay which the host apologized for, and we understand these things happen. However, it could have been dealt with much better if we had been informed earlier so we could have changed our plans accordingly: Due to some construction going on, the house had a cockroach breakout and the host tried desperately to get a professional to come help, but due to Christmas/holiday period they couldnt find anyone right away. They had noticed the cockroaches in the week leading up to the start of our stay. I wish they had told us so we could have changed our booking.
The house and furniture in this room is quiet old, the curtains cannot be pulled shut and the couch cover is torn. "
13808,57814433,29/12/15,9569595,Amelia,"We only stayed one night with JT and Tiziana, but it was great. Exactly what we were looking for. They are very friendly and accomodating. The room was comfortable and looks exactly like it does in the pictures.  They're close to a bunch of shops and a short walk away from the subway. The location was great for us. We'd definitely stay again. "
13808,59959612,17/1/16,32771644,Ya'El,"Tippy and JT are one of a kind, warm, hospitable, super humans. We spoke days in advance and she was so patient with every question I had.  The listing looks the same as in the photos."
13808,60673268,25/1/16,9167342,Mary,"This place is so lovely! I came here for a photo shoot (didn't stay the night) but it was clean and quiet and I would have definitely stayed here if I didn't already live in Brooklyn. The house is awesome-an original brownstone in Brooklyn, not renovated into tiny apartments like so many of the houses here. JT's friend Amanda let us in, and they were super accommodating for our same day last minute request. 10/10 would book again. "
13808,63772312,27/2/16,36285909,Johanna,"JT and Tiziana were amazing hosts and helped us whenever we asked them for anything. Their house is an original Brooklyn townhouse with charming interior and our room was really spacious. There are also four lovely cats which will pay attention to you if you pet them :) 
The house is located in the centre of Bed-Stuy which is a vibrant neighborhood from which you can easily reach other parts of NYC. 
We really enjoyed our stay and are grateful to JT and Tiziana for their hospitality! 
"
13808,63901908,28/2/16,960241,Erin,"We had a great time in NYC staying at  JT and Tippy's place. The space was quite lovely and very welcoming. We only stayed for one night but the experience was great and easy. It was a very short walk to the subway which made traveling especially nice and we also got an parking space very close to the apt. The only critique that I had was that it was a bit dusty in the room and bathroom. It was nothing that really bothered me to bad, but if I had my daughter with me (who is allergic to dust) it would've been a bit of an issue. Without her though, I wouldn't hesitate to stay again. We had a great experience. Oh, the bed was super soft and comfy too. "
13808,73648407,9/5/16,22666163,Tash,"JT and Tiziana's place was wonderful! What a treat of a place! And Tiziana was a great host, easy to communicate with and attentive. The room was big a spacious and the bed so comfy! Having access to a full kitchen as also so great.  The neighbourhood is beautiful with rows of brownstones and the local cafe ""Brunswick"" does great coffee. An easy half a block stroll to the subway was great for getting anywhere around town. Would have loved to stay longer! "
13808,74894972,17/5/16,59559653,Olga,I had booked a room for 3 days. JT and Tiziana are very communicative persons. They answered immediately and tried to make our accomodation as comfortable as possible.
13808,76245663,25/5/16,21145251,Emma,JT and Tiziana were very welcoming and clearly experienced hosts. There was a fresh pot of coffee every morning and were always available and helpful. The neighbourhood was perfectly authentic and the subway couldn't have been closer. We had a wonderful time and would absolutely stay with them again.
13808,80185065,16/6/16,47418988,Ayelen,"Jt and Tiziana made me feel very comfortable at their home. I stayed in the blue room, is very spacious , the bed is very comfortable and has plenty of room to store things . The bathroom is beautiful, everything was equipped and clean when I arrive. Tiziana is very friendly and I always help you need , giving me information needed to enjoy my stay in New York. Cats are adorable and made me feel at home. The neighborhood is very safe and there are many shops that are open late in case you need something, the subway is only two blocks away and takes you straight to Manhattan. Definitely if I ever go to New York again, I would choose this airbnb"
13808,107424721,10/10/16,15738412,Colin,"A charming and very comfortable place to stay. I would not have imagined being awakened by birds singing and the chiming of church bells while in Brooklyn, but it happened every morning. The house is big, the room is full of space and the bathroom was excellent."
13808,111766193,1/11/16,96276213,Sabri,"I totally loved my staying at Tippy and JT beautiful brownstone house!
The house is absolutely astonishing, authentic Brooklyn brownstone  and beautifully decorated. The location is very good and well connected with Manhattan; this is a safe area of Brooklyn (I was a female solo traveler in my first time in NYC and I felt abs safe)  in a very alternative and lively neighbor with so many little shops, cafe', restaurants...you can just spend hours walking and exploring it! 
Tippy and JT are adorable! they made me feel totally at home, I really didn't want to live them and the house! I cant wait for my next trip to NY for meeting them again! Sabrina"
13808,122379166,23/12/16,36201388,Samantha,"JT and Tiziana were great hosts. Their home was clean, spacious, close to the subway which made it great for my commute into Manhattan for work, and close to neighborhood restaurants and cafes. Their company, friendly cats, and beautiful home made me feel comfortable and relaxed while I stayed here for two months! I highly recommend staying with them for longer stays or a weekend away!!"
13808,133430569,22/2/17,7667995,Gillian,Really fun to get out of Manhattan and stay in Brooklyn. Close to the subway. Room is large and a private bathroom. Good communication and great directions.
13808,150310124,7/5/17,16528045,Svetla,Beautiful old stone house in a vibrant neighborhood. Tiziana and JT are wonderful hosts. I definitely recommend it for anyone who's looking for a quiet place to escape to after long days of exploring NYC and Brooklyn.

13808,161312637,17/6/17,20957556,Charlie,"Very charming home and equally charming hosts! Lots to look at and admire in a beautiful home. The Blue Room+bath are incredibly spacious and comfortable and the house is very close to the subway.  Appreciated the readily available books, ample seating, plenty of electrical outlets, soft towels, iron/hairdryer, and extra in-room storage space for clothes and bags. The neighborhood was both lively and quiet, we had no trouble sleeping in until the early afternoon and felt safe walking home from the subway at 4am. We didn't have time this trip to explore much of the neighborhood restaurants so can't advise as far as meals but check out the corner bodegas for 24 hour fresh homestyle food and snacks. And remember to fuss the cats on your way in or out, Mama Sophia monitors the front door at almost all hours! "
13808,175304990,28/7/17,35230671,Christine,JT and Tiziana sont des hôtes agréables et à l'écoute qui veillent au bien être des résidents. Chambre bien située pour se rendre en métro à Manhattan. Adresse à retenir pour un séjour new-yorkais.

13808,193227187,12/9/17,15740782,Mariah,"This home is really close to the train, which it very convenient to travel.
It's in a more traditional part of Brooklyn so there aren't any cafes around but since the train is no near that it didn't matter to us.
Since this was our first air B and B we didn't know what to except but we were pleasantly surprised with our hosts.The communication was excellent and the room was clean as well as our private bathroom.
The only negative thing I would say is as a single female I would be cautious walking around late night."
13808,194307244,16/9/17,81690662,Jake,"Really nice and interesting place to stay, the hosts are really lovely and accommodating people. Beautiful building and a really nice area to stay. Very easy to get into manhattan"

All communication was fast and they were really kind to me and my husband.
It´s very close to the subway. So, It is easy to go everywhere from their place. 
Unfortunately, I didn´t have enough time to discover more about Brooklyn and the places close to their house."
13808,205709159,22/10/17,65148450,Haoyu,JT and Tiziana are awesome. The room is spacious. the bath wall color was my favorite. 2 min to the subway. We enjoyed our stay.

13808,210855528,11/11/17,55210172,Nellie,"Beautiful, unique, historic and charming vibe space. Great for photography.
It would have been nice to control the heat in our room because it was very cold and then we asked to turn on the heat we were hot all night because we could not open the windows. Besides that we really enjoyed the space and atmosphere. 
Uber from our location to the Lower West Side cost about $25 one way which we did twice because it was very cold out."
13808,211608021,13/11/17,155172260,Jessie,"This was a very nicely decorated housing arrangement. The room is very spacious, bed is comfy, and the bathroom is right next to the room. There is a subway less than two blocks away also, which was very convenient for travel. And the hosts were lovely, very pleasant and welcoming. I would like to stay again and recommend to others for sure!"
13808,213866364,23/11/17,149182332,Sarah,We have a wonderful stay with JT and Tippy.  They are considerate and thoughtful hosts.  Response is timely and accurate.  Tips on local breakfast place is superb.  Subway is just around the corner.  And ride to JFK via subway and air train is cheap and quick.  Will definitely stay with them on our next visit.
13808,214337362,25/11/17,66262549,Maureen,"Amazing vibes and a gorgeous space! Check in and check out were very easy, the host had lots of recommendations for us and was very relaxed. Room was gorgeous and incredibly comfortable. Will stay again!"

Безопасный район и близкое расположение к метро(100метров), продуктовые магазины в шаговой доступности. Хозяева очень добродушные, открытые к общению и уважают ваше уединение, всегда готовы помочь и на связи. Уверена, что в следующий раз вернусь сюда.Спасибо большое Тициана!"

Un bémol quant à la vétusté de la maison qui mériterait un bon rafraîchissement. La station de métro est vraiment très proche ce qui est très pratique. Tippy est très disponible en cas de besoin. Elle a été très arrangeante pour que nous puissions récupérer nos valises à l'heure qui nous arrangeait le mieux le jour du départ (vol à 21h30), ce qui nous a permis de profiter du dernier jour sans ce soucis."

The bed was great and the private bathroom was huge! We would love to come back to their place someday. Thank you so much for having us. Getting to know you and staying at your place really let us enjoy NYC even more!
13808,299731136,31/7/18,3818694,April,"JT and Tiziana’s place is gorgeous and rich in character, a peaceful sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan and Brooklyn (but still so close to it all). 
A 2 minute walk to the subway and a direct line to Manhattan makes it easy and accessible at all hours. Don’t overlook all the things to see locally, though - our favorites were Lunatico around the corner (particularly gospel brunch) and Peaches restaurant. Prospect Park is also a stroll away.
The bed is so comfortable and perfect for long coffees in the morning. The bath is deep and perfect for bubbles at anytime. If you’re lucky you might hear music coming through the floor from JT’s studio.
JT and Tiziana are always around and open to chat, but definitely give you plenty of privacy. The cats are also there to cuddle when you want. We almost felt like we had our own place for our 2 month stay, which is a rarity. Thanks for having us!
"
13808,302502922,5/8/18,207180192,Matthew,"The room was perfect, I never wanted to leave! The house just felt loving and comfortable, like another home. JT and Laura were as kind as can be and I look forward to spending more time there in the future :)"
13808,311570914,21/8/18,86151875,Stefano,"Siamo stati ospiti di JT e Tiziana per 14 giorni durante le vacanze estive questo Agosto. Siamo rimasti soddisfatti in pieno.
La casa è situata in una posizione strategica ottimale: fermata della metro a pochi passi dalla quale ci si può recare in Manhattan in circa 15 minuti.
Il quartiere multietnico è assolutamente vivace e tranquillo . Può sembrare difficile per un italiano non abituato a vivere con diverse culture così a stretto contatto ma ci siamo sentiti più sicuri di camminare di notte qui che a Times Square in città. Inoltre il posto è Ricco di posti non turistici dove recarsi per mangiare ad una qualità diversa da quella che trovereste a Manhattan.
La casa presenta un ingresso con soggiorno comune, una scala di legno che porta ai piani superiori (con le relative camere) e alla cucina con frigorifero in comune.
La camera da letto dispone di letto matrimoniale, sgabuzzino, aria condizionata e bagno privato.
Durante il nostro soggiorno purtroppo non abbiamo potuto conoscere di persona Tiziana. Lei però è stata gentilissima e sempre disponibile  tramite telefono. Suo marito JT simpaticissimo ci ha sempre trattato bene con premura che fossimo soddisfatti.
Non vediamo l’ora di tornare
Grazie"
13808,314911413,27/8/18,36086776,Maria,This lovely old brownstone is full of character and charm. I loved the claw foot bathtub and the artwork. It’s got a bohemian vibe that may not suit all tastes but it was indeed right up my alley. Access to the subway couldn’t be better. JT was interesting and extremely hospitable and responsive. He recommended the Sumner Cafe down the street and it was fantastic. I felt very comfortable & it all made for a lovely long weekend in NYC.
13808,319144742,5/9/18,163788857,Andrew,Authentic brownstone close to subway and some excellent eating places. We particularly liked Sumner cafe for breakfast (corned beef hash a real favourite) and Besa restaurant where the tapas was really good. We also liked Peaches restaurant. Location to subway was a bonus allowing us to be in central Manhattan in about 30 minutes. Will return.
14287,22188,1/1/10,60397,Wanda,The place was awesome! Clean and super cute. It was right by a metro.

14287,43760,18/5/10,108924,Merja,"The apartment is really cute and cozy, just right for a single traveller on short stay in NY. The location in UWS is convenient with metro lines both on Broadway (3 blocks away) and just round the corner. The only drawback is the tiny kitchen that is not really suitable for proper cooking and like most brownstones in the city the lack of an elevator. In spite of that I would definately like to stay at Joya's place again. "
14287,46792,27/5/10,113644,Roxanne,"The apartment is absolutely lovely, very clean, very large and in a great neighborhood. Renters should note that although the per night charge is very low, Joya charges additional $60 for cleaning; was a surprise to me. But otherwise, I would recommend."

She left clear instructions about the key exchange, and was able to graciously accomodate a last minute change in our schedule. Her apartment was spacious for a one bedroom, neat, quiet, and on a lovely street close to the subway and retail. We were surprised by a cold wave in NYC and had not brought enough warm clothes; there was a thrift shop a few blocks away that had everything we needed. We very much enjoyed our stay and would recommend Joya's apartment to anyone looking for a quiet and convenient UWS location."

14287,113110946,10/11/16,69254739,Darci,"Joya provide details timely and detailed response to my booking inquiry.  Apartment is located a stones throw from Central Park, which was ideal for my morning runs, but close to a number of great ethnic restaurants"
14287,116007129,27/11/16,14565527,Sophie,"Joya was very responsive and answered all our questions. She was very flexible with our check-in time and the check in process was very easy. Fabulous location less than 1/2 block to Central Park. This was the highlight of our trip and we walked in the park every morning. Joya's apartment is very spacious - especially for NYC. Comfortable couch, 4 person dining room table, very simple but functional kitchen, decent sized bathroom with bathtub and good water pressure. She is a 4th floor walk up so keep that in mind & try to pack light. House is decorated with interesting, international & eclectic art - a bit cluttered but cute. We couldn't turn down the heat (original fixtures in an old building) but with the windows open we were comfortable. Overall we had a great visit and enjoyed staying at Joyas and it was almost half the price of nearly any hotel over Thanksgiving."

The location is also outstanding, half a block away from Central Park,  on a quiet street.  The bed was comfortable, as was the sitting room.   "
14287,281812387,25/6/18,90713216,Karen,"I loved this apartment! Very cozy, very NY, very close to everywhere I wanted to go, including subway stations. I loved it and I would love to stay there the next time I travel to NY. Thank you very much, Joya!"

14287,285387553,3/7/18,153303514,Paul,"Great location on the upper west side, easy walk to Central Park and Museum of Natural History.  MOMA just across the park.
Apartment is in an older building on a quiet residential street in a clean and safe neighborhood.  Numerous restaurants and shops located just a block or two away, as well as subway access.  (Please note that apartment is on 4th floor with no elevator.  If this is a concern you may want to look elsewhere.)
Apartment was clean and spacious (by NYC standards).  Kitchen is small but clean and functional.  Wifi worked with no issues.
Host instructions were clear and easy to follow.  Host was responsive to questions and very professional.
Overall we had a great stay.  Highly recommend, and would definitely stay again."

Lots of restaurants nearby, close to Central Park and still feels like an oasis in the city.This apartment is in an old brownstone up three flights of stairs. Quiet. Comfortable. Good bed.

* The space is absolutely inspiring and flooded with natural light, particularly during the late morning.

* The location happens to be conveniently nearby both the L train (takes you midtown) and the J train (if you're going to lower Manhattan).

* James is a chill host who knows what he's doing.

Anyway, if you do rent this place, do us all a favor, 
and try to keep it a secret, k?"
14290,26706,17/2/10,79896,Tatar,James is a great host. Very nice and helpful. And his place is perfect. Lots of sunlight and so close to subway. Strongly recommending it...
14290,29792,16/3/10,83547,Rafael,"Me and my girlfirend stayed there and everything was great! Was our first time in NY, and If you check the street view, maybe you get scared like us, but the area is completely safe, and is kind of a new created neighborhood, lots of artists, good cafes, great organic supermarket, and only 10 minutes to manhattan by L train....  even if you dont get this house, go to this area to eat at roberto.s pizza, everything on that pizzas is organic!

James was great helping us for everything, and house was clean and big, also you can cook at home so you spend half money in your travel.

We really have to say thanks to James! We hope we,ve been same good as guests, like him as landlord.

14290,38948,30/4/10,97263,Kellar,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for two weeks at the end of April and absolutely loved it. The neighborhood was surprisingly filled with life, tons of cute little hipsters hanging at Cafe Orwell and outside the Brooklyn Natural grocery store. Although it's an industrial area, people are everywhere and the L stop is super close. Roberta's pizza two blocks away is amazing, as well as Life cafe (two blocks away in the other direction).

We liked it so much in fact that I'm looking at a loft a block away today to move into. 

All in all, a pleasant stay. The accommodations were perfect. Ton's of space to work and relax and James is as nice as can be.

"
14290,103908,24/9/10,31305,Are,"My father and I were fortunate enough to stay at James Henrys loft in Bushwhick for almost 3 weeks, this september. The flat is excellent, both practically and designwise. James is generous and a great host.
As a photographer I especially enjoyed all the light coming into the loft-space.
The neighborhood is very interesting, with hidden qualities, great bars and restaurants. We warmly recomend both the flat and its surroundings.   "
14290,107582,28/9/10,235662,Jeremy + Katrina,"I stayed at this loft with some friends for a great weekend.  It was a wonderful experience... seamless.  I we found the neighborhood inspiring, and the loft was everything that James said it was.  The space is clean, artful and you feel at home. You will love it.  My highest recommendation.  Thanks James!"
14290,112836,6/10/10,204018,Deborah,"James was terrific and the apartment absolutely beautiful. The location is close to the train, the coffee at Cafe Orwell is as good as everyone says, and it's a wonderful, unique space. I recommend this place wholeheartedly!"

14290,133309,4/11/10,207868,Astrid,"James is the a very welcoming artist. His broolyn loft is huge, comfy, the light is just amazing. This is a place to relax and have some ideas for a new project. I was there with 4 collegues friends for three weeks, I had the best time in Brooklyn ever. The area is great, Brushwick is the place to be in Brooklyn now for artists and all kind of easy going people. With the L-train, we are in the city in 15minutes. This is a fantastic place to stay. I wish I come back soon. xxx all the best to Jame's next guests, astrid serafini"
14290,135399,8/11/10,143460,Megan,"I stayed in James' loft for 4 days in the beginning of November with a friend of mine and had an excellent stay. The place is even better than the photos - lots of light and space. It's very comfortable, clean and in a great part of Brooklyn. You can chose more hip spots like Cafe Orwell or walk down to Broadway & Flushing for great soul food and bargain hunting. We were two single girls and didn't have any issues walking home at night. The loft is under a flight path, but you don't hear the planes over head after a night. Other than that, it's relatively quiet. James is a great, welcoming host and has plenty of tips and is incredibly helpful.  Can't wait to stay here again during our next trip - thanks again!"
14290,138675,14/11/10,19534,Gerard,"The brooklyn loft was perfect.  Clean, spacious and had everything we needed. It was an easy commute to Manhattan and quick to get into Williamsburgh from Montross or Morgan Ave L trains.  I'll definitely be back!  Thanks James!"
14290,142680,22/11/10,257789,Ioanna,"Wonderful loft apartment! Location is incredible - 2 seconds from the L train which is perfect if you want to check out the Williamsburg area, or go to Manhattan. The building was great - quiet and safe. The loft sells itself - it just like the pictures, but comes with a great host! (Thanks so much James). Laundry is on the corner of Bushwick street (drop off cost us 12 bucks and was ready the same day!). Perfect place to stay in New York - we will be back!! Thanks so much James! "

In a really nice part of town, and very close to the subway, so it was easy to get everywhere.

Would definitely recommend it!
"
14290,180771,11/2/11,337074,Julie,"Our stay in James' loft was magical. It's a great spacious flat that is lofty but has a very homely/ comfy feel to it which is usually hard to find. 
We liked the neighbourhood which has a few great places to eat (Roberta's) and drink (The King's County). There is very easy access to Manhattan by walking to the Morgan L stop in about 5 minutes tops then getting on the most reliable subway line (we think) straight to the heart of NYC. 
We felt very much at home and Brooklyn is a great place to stay when in New York. 
"
14290,197709,13/3/11,371590,John,We enjoyed meeting James and staying in his Brooklyn loft. Nicely laid out and equipped. There was plenty of room for all 5 of us and it was located very conveniently for getting in and out of Manhattan. Also some good restaurants and coffee shops nearby too. We'll definitely stay there again if we visit New York in the future. John S. and family.
14290,221078,9/4/11,414010,Sofi,"Amazing part of town, close to some of the best restaurants in Brooklyn (Momo and Tandem). Don't let the distance to Manhattan scare you off, this place is magic."
14290,226780,15/4/11,361336,Maria,The host canceled my reservation 2 days before arrival.
14290,427690,8/8/11,532009,Aymeric,"James is very easy-going and even on a trip to Europe we found a way to make things smooth. Great guy!
Very nice loft, the pictures are not lying at all. The location was perfect to me : close to Williamsburg and Bushwick. The best of both worlds : hipsters on fixies and puertoricans :) ! 
You feel like a new-yorker @James'

Be aware though: this place is not for first time tourists.
But if you wanna feel the vibe and the culture of a disappearing New York, this neighborhood is for you.

Nice view from the rooftop, graffitis on the streets' walls, if Keith Haring was still around this where he would be !"
14290,487926,30/8/11,704678,Sebastian,"This is the ultimate NY experience in this loft. We felt like we were right at home at this enormous space. There are too many things to mention, James was delightful and would definitely stay again. Thanks"

James is a great host, and had recommend a lot of nearby restaurants that we really enjoyed. A special experience to stay here, and we can really recommend it!"
14290,21786130,24/10/14,417084,Dineke,"I couldn't have wished for a better place to stay on my 2 week trip to NY. That goes for both the loft and the neighbourhood. James was very easy to communicate with. Handing over the keys went smoothly.
I loved exploring the industrial neighbourhood with its nice restaurants. Convenience store, great wineshop and L-train which takes you to Manhattan in 15-20 min around the corner.
The loft is a great place to hang out and do some work if you need to. It's really quiet, I slept like a baby."

The loft is exactly as it looks in the pics and is huge.
Anything we needed James was at the end of the phone for even with the time difference.
Also the area that the loft is in (East Williamsburg/Bushwick) has some of the best restaurants in the city and is super close to the subway.
Thanks for the stay James! Would highly recommend

We enjoyed staying there for the most part and even though there was a miscommunication about check in, James did his best to rectify the issue and was accommodating. There were a couple of noisy nights during the 8 that we stayed there, but Bushwick isn't exactly known for being a quiet neighborhood.  Would definitely recommend for a larger group, especially if you're interested in staying in the neighborhood. "
14290,102362445,17/9/16,58397508,Alexis,"Very large loft---looks just like the photographs provided. Easy access to Manhattan, close to the L train and basic necessities (e.g. market, coffee shop, etc.) It was quite hot in the summer with no AC and it is a four floor walk-up but overall great place and price for an extended stay. I'd definitely recommend for large groups."

Also the bathroom is a bit of a bummer, very small, no window, just not as nice as the rest of the loft. But other than that, the loft is a great place to spend a few days, especially if you like to explore Bushwick and Williamsburg. The area is great, good shops around and fantastic restaurants. You must try the pizza at Roberta's!"

Nestled on a quite street on the border between Williamsburg and Bushwick, the two hippest areas, lies James incredible apartment. We were absolutely amazed by the unique decor of this place. Coloured pipes; retro furniture; hundreads of interesting objects and tree trunks hanging from the ceiling. An absolute joy to look at and to spend time in. 
It's also very close to one the best pizza places in town and incredibly convenient, if you want to grab the L Line into Manhatten (25min door to door to my office in Chelsea market). 
Overall really enjoyed my stay in this super quirky and stylish property. "

It's less than a couple of minutes to the L train at Morgan and when that is closed J&Mnaf Flushing Ave are less than 10 mins walk. We enjoyed all the bars and cafes close by. The apartment itself was just as described. Lots of space. The only small problem we had was the Internet was not particularly strong, so this is worth considering if you are travelling on business.

14290,299841518,31/7/18,26471651,Caesario,"BOOK AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! This is the airbnb that you do not what to book. James was unreachable for 9+ hours on the day of my check in. He accepted my booking and did not send any check in information. Upon trying to reach him i find out that his number is international and not available. So he is not even in the country. He could have left me with an alternative contact knowing he was going to be unreachable. When he finally gets in touch its with absolutely no remorse for his inaction, just with a phone number that I can call and he goes off-grid again. At this point i have been hanging on the street for 5+ . hours with 3 massive suitcases. It took Airbnb another 3 hours to cancel this reservation and release my funds so i could book an alternative accommodation. I spent a total of 2 hours back and forth on the phone and texting with the most bias and unhelpful Airbnb support staff who used delay as a tactic to try to force me to check in to this apartment. After i clearly communicated that i did not feel welcome there. I can go on.....but i think you get the picture. This experience defeats the concept of finding a space that you can call home away from home. Zero hospitality and massive FAIL on the host and Airbnb "

We were delayed arriving in New York by about 20 hours but Jacquline went out of her way to give a friend of ours the keys, and then we lost a key and she was quick to help with that and very understanding. All-in-all an amazing stay. Would recommend to everyone!"
14314,20198,13/12/09,60287,Akilah,"We enjoyed our stay at Jeanne's humble abode :) It was super cozy and well-kept. I would recommend this place to anyone. Only one thing to keep in mind, the walls are thin, you may hear a bit of noise from time to time because the apartment is in the basement. But other than that the place is Lovely and Jeanne and George were the most hospitable! "
14314,22880,3/1/10,54720,Shannan,"My stay at gorgeous in greenpoint was wonderful!! The place is beautiful, as well as the neighborhood. I definitely recommend staying in greenpoint when visiting NY!!! Thank you Jeanne for making my family vacation such a wonderful one!!!!"
14314,24347,18/1/10,67940,James,"They did an excellent job converting a basement into a very comfortable apartment.  The bathroom tile and kitchen were amazing. The only negatives are the footsteps of their two kids running around early in the evening and the low ceiling support across half the apartment, hit my head a few times.  I also was quite surprised by the additional cleaning charge or $50. Personally I think that should have been a part of the rental charge, but oh well."
14314,24871,25/1/10,71025,Erica,"Just returned home from a weekend in New York City where I stayed in Jeanne's adorable apartment in Brooklyn.  We really enjoyed the Greenpoint neighborhood which is still not totally hippified and yet has plenty of excellent (and reasonably priced) restaurants to enjoy.  Getting into Manhattan takes a bit of effort, but is not a chore: the ""G"" train, or a convenient bus takes you to a number of train-lines that speed you into the city.
Especially enjoyed coming home to the apartment with its separate entrance, and which Jeanne has lovingly furnished with every thought for the comfort and convenience of her guests. One caveat: as this cozy apartment is carved out of the basement space, the ceilings are somewhat low; a tall person would need to mind.  I would definitely stay there again.
 "
14314,26794,18/2/10,80628,Ed,"A nice apartment- thoughtfully designed, and a pleasure to come home to after a long day out. It's true that there is a bit of noise from footsteps above, but not late at night, so we slept very well. The glass tiles in the kitchen and bathroom are amazing and the place was immaculate. I would recommend this place to anyone!"
14314,29354,14/3/10,69700,Akeisha,"I had a great time staying at Jeanne's apartment.  It's lovely, comfortable, and within a short walking distance to a subway stop and a variety of restaurants.  There were some footstep & dog noises but I didn't find them any worse than staying at my friend's Brooklyn apartment.  I would definitely stay at Jeanne's again."
14314,30846,22/3/10,54314,Vo,"Our stay at Jeanne's was perfect, everything we needed was provided.  The place is very comfy and home-like which was one of the reasons we wanted to stay there.  She was very helpful and answered every question we had.  We will definitely stay at Jeanne's again in the future"
14314,34000,7/4/10,46001,Louise,"Jeanne's apartment is beautifully decorated and a great size considering its location.
We only got to meet the family on the last night as they'd been on holiday, they were very helpful with information about getting to airport and Jeanne even booked us a taxi. Its a very short walk to the subway and one easy train change and you're in Manhattan. There are plenty of Grocery stores in the main street (which the apartment is in a side street from), the area felt very safe even when we walked back from the Subway around 11pm.
We had a wonderful trip in NYC and if we're ever book wouldn't hesitate to stay here again! Thanks Jeanne and family and my mum would like to say how much she loved your cats. "
14314,45758,24/5/10,107299,Ashley,"The place was absolutely wonderful! Cozy, tidy, and neat. We definitely will use this apartment again, located in the great area of Greenpoint full of ethnic restaurants! Jeanne had provided maps of New York, local restaurant menus, all the  toiletries, towels, a fan, all the kitchen necessities and so much more! Neighborhood is quiet and safe, just note there is quite a bit of noise from the footsteps upstairs. Personally I would rather hear the footsteps of 
a family home than all the screaming, yelling, loud music, and more that come with an apartment complex.:) 
thanks Jeanne!    "
14314,65404,17/7/10,89084,Katie,"We stayed at Jeanne's gorgeous apartment in Greenpoint from July 11-17th and had a wonderful time. It was a lovely, quiet place to relax after long days in the city. The air conditioner felt awesome during the heat wave that we experienced. 

Make sure to have breakfast or lunch at Brooklyn Label (great prices, just a few blocks away) and stock up the kitchen with lots of food to save some money.

14314,120811,17/10/10,241883,Ann,"Beautiful accommodations.. friendly and helpful host, great communication, easy stay.

Slept 4 comfortably.. great deal for this neighborhood! If you want to stay in Greenpoint the nearest hotel is in Queens and there is not public transit.. this place was great... just a short walk to the train and you can be in Wiliamsberg or Manhattan in no time at all! 

Wonderful neighborhood with lots of cute shops, restaurants and bars. Thanks Gorgeous in Greenpont for a wonderful stay! 

I would recommend this rental to anyone!! It was great and we will defiantly book for our next visit!!"
14314,142710,22/11/10,261561,Elizabeth,"My family was visiting from out of town and had a great stay at Jeanne's apartment. She was very attentive and helpful, and my family could not stop expressing how pleased they were with the place--it was very clean and decorated nicely. It was perfect for their visit. Would highly recommend, and when they come back, they'd like to stay there again!"
14314,193950,7/3/11,63563,Kitty,"Whether blasting around NYC on business or just visiting the area, this apartment is a peaceful sanctuary located on the quieter end of Greenpoint that is a pleasure to return to at the end of the day. Jeanne has thought of everything you might need, and the other reviews that remarked on how spotless the apartment is are absolutely accurate. Not sure if anyone mentioned the beautiful shower--a real treat.  (And runners--this is a great place to get in the miles! Flat, interesting, and offer a nice over the East River and into Central Park if you are so inclined.)"
14314,255259,8/5/11,468985,William,"Jeanne was a gracious and friendly host. Everything was as promised, clean, comfortable, and quiet. Apartment is very well appointed with every imaginable need addressed. Highly recommended for short or long term stay in Brooklyn.

14314,360520,8/7/11,683475,Lisette,"I will definately stay here the next time I am in NYC. It is affordable and perfect for a family of 4. Once u get the hang of the subway it is an easy ride to manhatten. The 4$ dollar ferry to Pier 17 is an easy option, as well. All in all a wonderful stay in a perfectly cosy/clean appartment in a convenient/safe location.

Thanks Jeanne & George!

14314,544134,18/9/11,1012623,Christopher,"Jeanne and George's place was just perfect for our getaway.  We just loved it.  The place is perfectly renovated and decorated with excellent taste and timeless style.  The kitchen and bathroom were perfectly stocked with everything you could possibly need.  It was like a luxury master suite at a 5 star hotel but with the warmth of a cozy home.  I'll add it was super neat and clean.  

The location is just prime, everything you need within a few blocks walking distance, groceries, food, shopping, great restaurants, getting to the City or Williamsburg is a breeze and just minutes by train.

From the key-less entry to the cable ready living room and serene bedroom, it was the perfect stay and we look forward to coming back real soon.  We didn't get to meet Jeanne until check-out but she was just adorable, lovely family, and they are NY Ranger fans to boot, GO RANGERS!


Note: If your from the UK or a fan of a Proper English breakfast!.  Jeane and George's place is just minutes from one of my favorite places to eat breakfast, Gordon Bennett's in Williamsburg, they serve up the best proper fry-up you'll ever get in all of NY, it's just Pucker!

Thanks again to Jeanne & George for hosting a wonderful place.

14314,584763,1/10/11,382798,Rafael,"Jeanne is a great host! Everything was perfect!! Location (Greenpoint Brooklyn, great & quiet spot, well provided in restaurants,bars & convenience stores, the appartment (big,new,well equiped, very clean and finely decorated), public transportation (few steps to MTA, 10 min to get midtown Manhattan by ferry with wonderfull views) and the kindness of Jeanne and George! I definetely recommend staying at Jeanne's. Thanks for the experience. Rafael."
14314,733018,21/11/11,988090,Adriana,"Our stay at Jeanne and George was great. This is a perfect getaway location. After all the huzzle and buzzle of New York it feels great to arrive back in Greenpoint. There are all kind of shops for your convenience in the neighbourhood. 
The apartment is clean, tidy and cosy. And what a lovely shower!
The subway is nearby and it takes about 30 minutes to get from Greenpoint to Times square and 42nd street. With one transfer.

It was also very nice to meet Jeanne, George and the kids.
We will definately come back to Greenpoint!"
14314,755807,30/11/11,1303312,Charles,We loved the little apartment and found Greenpoint fascinating.  Had a great breakfast at Papacitos and would like to go there at night.  Great neighborhood feeling.  Sorry we couldn't try the ferry from India road.  The apartment was in great shape and had some nice guidebooks. Took the G down to Willamsburg for some great restaurants.  Would recommend this.  We did not get to see Jeanne--- maybe next time.
14314,804954,25/12/11,1367734,Ana,"gorgeous in greenpoint it's a real home away from home! we've loved everything about it. it had everything that we needed: linen, extra blankets, a million of towels, shampoos, shower gels, coffee, sugar, ... saving us space in our suitcases. every morning we walked 15 min accros the bridge and grabbed a metro there, so we were on times square in no time. would love to go there again. thank you, jeanne :)"
14314,954016,27/2/12,1752839,Thomas,"Great experience, exactly what we were after. The apartment is perfect as a base to go and explore. This part of Greenpoint hasn't yet changed into the madness that Williamsburg has become, yet there is a great collection of little places opening up. Great coffee, Thai food, polish food and no more than 20 minutes walk gets you to PS1/Moma. 25 minute walk in the other direction and you are in Williamsburg. Can be in mid-town in less than 25 minutes."
14314,1126569,14/4/12,1207411,Åse,Nice and tidy apartement. Everything worked very well in contact with Jeanne. Close to everything and wonderful neighborhoods. We could have spent our 9 days only in Brooklyn. 
14314,1252833,9/5/12,63563,Kitty,"This was my second stay at Jeanne's, and it was as excellent as the first. Jeanne is stunningly easy to work with, crystal clear about everything, and gracious to boot. The apartment is immaculate and quiet. Heaven for anyone looking for a place that both soothes the nerves and feels homey. Be sure to try the East River Ferry service at India St., as it is a great alternative to the subway. Also, be sure to try Anella's or the recently opened Gwynnet Street. Fantastic food. And the nearby Ashbox Cafe is a great place for breakfast (cash only)."
14314,1409053,4/6/12,1520278,Nick,"Staying at t Jeanne's apartment made a great trip perfect!  The apartment had everything our family of four needed and was wonderfully finished.  We loved the Greenpoint neighborhood with its array of eateries, Champion Coffee, markets, playgrounds, etc.  It is also super convienient to get anywhere in the city due to its proximity to the subway and East River Ferry.  One of our favorite parts of our time there was talking with Jeanne and getting an insider's view of living in the area.  We can't say enough good things and are looking forward to our next visit!"
14314,1849348,31/7/12,2479878,Stephen,"Jeanne's basement apt in Greenpoint was our first stop on an extended vacation into New England. I agree with all the positive comments about the apartment. Our stay was for 3 nights and it was very confortable space for 3 people. Much roomier than a NY hotel room. I especially appreciated the air conditioning, as it was hot and muggy during our stay. The walk to the subway or the ferry was about equal distance and I would recommend using the ferry at least once if you want some views of New York City from the East River. Note: The ferry stops very briefly  so you must have your ticket from the kiosk and be ready to board when it arrives. 

We never met Jeanne, but she had plenty of maps and references for us in the apt.  Local Brooklyn restaurants are great and reasonably priced. One we really enjoyed was Cafecito Bogota, 1015 Manhattan Ave., Colombian cuisine, a short walk from the apt. Another a short distance further was OTT, a Thai restaurant, 970 Manhattan Ave. This area in Greenpoint is a Polish neighborhood and we  bought some of the old country pastries. However along Manhattan Ave there are a multitude of coffee houses, bars, small markets, and more.

The only reason I rated the overall experience 4 out of 5 stars was the car service, Java. The apt had their cards as part of the information so we used them when departing. What a mistake.  We were very disappointed with the rudeness of the driver, the quoted price to Grand Central Station had undisclosed additional ""charges"" and the driver did not want to help unload our luggage from the trunk when we arrived. He did not want to get out the the car due to some concerns he had about him being able to stop at the curb there.

In comparison, the times we took a taxi we had no problems other than giving the driver major cross streets in Brooklyn. And taxi fares to Greenpoint from Manhattan were generally less than $20.

The apartment in my opinion is a 5 out of 5 stars and what a relief to come back from a day in Manhattan to a quieter place in Greenpoint.

"
14314,3085734,14/12/12,3488533,Chris & Liz,"Jeanne's apartment is perfect if you want to be easily into the hustle and bustle of Manhattan but with the option of returning to a homely and relaxing base.

The apartment was more than big enough for the two of us, was beautifully and thoughtfully decorated, and had all the mod cons we needed. The kitchen was perfect for making our breakfasts before a day exploring, and the shower was great.

Greenpoint itself is a very nice neighbourhood from what we saw of it, and a nice contrast to other parts of NYC we visited. The apartment had easy access for both the G and 7 trains too which was helpful.

Our biggest tip would be to use the East River Ferry, $4 to Wall Street from India Street, and the perfect opportunity to cruise along the Manhattan front and under the Brooklyn Bridge.

We have had a fabulous time and would not hesitate to use the apartment again on a return to New York, nor to reccomend it to our friends and family."
14314,3731688,9/3/13,788386,Yokeu,"I spent a week in Jeanne's apartment with my family and it really does have everything! Neighbourhood has everything you will need, from coffee houses with free wifi to laundromats to great choice of eating places. Subway is nearby and you're minutes away from Manahttan. The apartment is clean and cosy and Jeanne and her husband were very helpful setting up the heating and the internet for us. Kitchen is fully equipped with everything you would need to cook, which I did a lot of for my 3 year old daughter. wifi and tv were great. I've used other airbnb apartments in NY before but Jeanne's place will be my first choice from now on. 

Thanks Jeanne!"
14314,9369878,24/12/13,10083503,Bathsheba,"This apartment was awesome. Having lived in the neighborhood, we were very familiar with the area and the apt. felt like being at home-well planned, designed, and though out it fit our family of four + baby comfortably. The hosts were responsive and excellent and we look forward to staying again on our next visit."

They are wonderful hosts and made the experience like staying with friends. The kitchen has all the needed items to prepare simply meals and the bedroom offered much storage for all our needs. "
14314,11655514,11/4/14,10018732,Darren,"My family and I spent 4 nights here in early April. Way, way better than paying for a hotel. Plenty of space and comfort for the 4 of us and literally a 10 minute walk to the 7 train and then only 2 stops to Times Square. If heading to the south end of Manhattan a short walk to the G train. The place was perfectly clean and it was great to have a kitchen with basic provisions to have breakfast before we went out each morning. Every night we came back around 11 or 12 and never felt anything but perfectly safe walking back. 24 hour mini market just a 1 minute walk away perfect to buy bread and eggs etc. Also great to be able to pick up a few beers each night when we got back.

If we make it back to New York we will definitely be trying to stay here again. It was quite soothing to be staying in this neighbourhood and not the madness of Manhattan. Also only about a $20 taxi trip from LGA."
14314,13500542,29/5/14,11794145,Julie,"This Greenpoint apartment was perfect for us. It was clean, very comfortable, and close to the subway and great restaurants.

We'll definitely be staying here again during future visits to New York. It was really nice to come ""home"" to a cozy apartment instead of an impersonal hotel room at the end of a long day. "
14314,14821477,27/6/14,514035,Jason,"Aside from some Wifi connection issues (macbook doesnt like WPA on AES) the place was great for what we needed, about a 10 minute walk to a couple of subway stations. It felt clean and modern even if the bathroom is a bit of a squash. The $50 cleaning fee is a bit cheeky but it is what it is. A washer/drier would be nice but there is a laundromat down the road. Noise from above was minimal and the AC kept things cool even if it is a bit noisy. No electric kettle so you'll need to boil it on the stove or microwave if you want a hot drink. Overall it was what we needed."
14314,18047736,21/8/14,11617550,Peter,"Das Apartment von Jeanne ist ausgezeichnet, wenn man nicht nur im Trubel von Manhattan unterwegs sein möchte. In der Gegend gibt es viele gemütliche Bars und Lokale und trotzdem ist man mit der Fähre bzw. der U-Bahn schnell in Manhattan. Das Apartment ist sehr sauber und gemütlich - ideal für zwei bis drei Personen. Wir haben Jeanne leider nicht persönlich getroffen. Es hat aber organisatorisch wunderbar funktioniert. Alles in allem: Sehr zu empfehlen, wenn man Zeit in Brooklyn verbringen möchte. "

We used the bus or ferry to the subway and generally cab back($12).  Clean, comfortable and well equipped.  Never had the pleasure of meeting Jeanne, but access into the property was slick with the lock box/pin number.  Would highly recommend to others."

Jeanne gave us a ""home away from home"" welcome the minute we walked in.  The entire apartment is warm and cozy and we wanted for nothing.  Everything we needed was provided.  The location was close to everything, and we just love this Greenpoint neighborhood.  We will definitely return for future visits.  "

The location is very convenient to the metro station and the ferry that let you get to the center of Manhattan in less than 30 minutes.
Only negative to report is warming below our expectations, partly because of the very cold weather outside.
We highly recommend the apartment for a pleasant holiday in NY in warmer periods."

The kitchen is nice and there is a big fridge and coffee and drip machine. 
It's a basement apartment so this helps keep coole in summer. Has low ceiling.
Nice neighbourhood away from the main street, and nice restaurants/bars hidden on back streets on the other side of Manhatten Rd.

The apartment is lovely, not a vast amount of natural light but who needs that, when you're going to be out and about in New York all day?! The area is lovely too, amazing $1 oysters, $3 well drinks and yummy chicken wings right around the corner from the apartment. 

When you walk to the 7 train each day you get an amazing Manhattan skyline view - I was gawping at it so much I walked into a lamppost!

It's the best place to stay, away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan, and doesn't cost the earth unlike the hotels in New York!"

The apartment is exactly as pictured, kept very clean, and well stocked. The design of the space is gorgeous. And Jeanne had everything we could need! We had four people stay in the apartment. There were plenty of towels, linens, pillows, blankets, shampoo, kitchen supplies- dishes, pots, pans, toaster, etc. The door is on a code, so there is no need to worry about keys. I immediately felt at home in the space!

The location is great! It is a quick walk to the G train or over the Pulaski Bridge to the 7 train. There are plenty of great restaurants and corner groceries to pick from in the area. We walked every day to get coffee at the nearby Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts (there is a coffee maker in the kitchen if you prefer your own). Check out the Polish Bakery too! It is excellent! Jeanne left a list of recommended restaurants and groceries in the apartment too, which was helpful. Overall, a great neighborhood."

We have everything we need when we stay here.  Located on a nice quiet residential street, the location is close to fantastic restaurants and shops.  It's our home away from home when we visit our son and daughter-in-law and we look forward to future visits.  Thank you Jeanne and George for everything.  Josie and Gary"
14314,53960680,15/11/15,40528918,Shab,"Jeanne was a phenomenal host. She was very accessible and helpful when it comes to where to go, what to eat, etc. The neighborhood and home were both extremely cozy. We couldn't have picked a better spot. Also, the fact that Lobster Joint is right down the street is just an added bonus :)"
14314,56301861,12/12/15,4934888,Akin,"Speckless clean, charming, very practical.  Sweet kitchen and coubter. Our kids loved playing with the toys. Convenient to the train. What a great place for our stay in NYC.  Look forward to staying there again one day hopefully.  Thank you to Jeanne!"
14314,60624869,25/1/16,21379507,Rick,"Jeanne was a wonderful host continually communicating to make sure we had everything we needed. Her place was nicely furnished and decorated....a real nice, cozy apt with a new feel...a separate entrance with an automated lock so no need to hassle with keys. A very quiet place on a quiet street convenient to restaurants and grocery. Look forward to staying with her again."
14314,69711355,12/4/16,4918414,Laurent,"Jeanne et Georges sont trés bien.
L'appartement est trés bien, comme sur les photos.
Le Subway est a 10 minutes à pied de L'appartement.
Time Square est a 35 minutes en Subway.
Merci de nous avoir reçu.
Meilleurs salutations 
Laurent"
14314,75737471,22/5/16,22045492,Richard,Great location close to everything in Greenpoint and easy to get to Manhattan. Jeanne was welcoming and accommodating. We were visiting for a wedding in Greenpoint and this was a great base for us.
14314,76300198,26/5/16,43988046,Lara,"My aunt and I stayed at Jeanne's apartment for a few nights while traveling in New York. We were most impressed with the location and would definitely choose to stay in Brooklyn if we are to travel in NY again. It was very handy having access to a 24 hour small store which is just down the road and there are lots of lovely places to eat within walking distance. The apartment itself was okay. The keyless entry was great! I wouldn't recommend for anyone to stay on the pullout sofa though as it's not very comfortable. All in all a comfortable enough stay and Jeanne is a good communicator who was always happy to answer any of our questions. 
We thought the USD50 cleaning fee was a bit cheeky though."
14314,84883298,9/7/16,51911558,Natacha,"The apartment was spotless with lots of character.  Quiet residential neighbourhood with cafes, restaurants and groceries within a short walk.  We walked in late evenings and felt quite safe. The host lives on the premises and was available if required.   On street parking only, and difficult to get spot close by though and walked 4 blocks with our luggage, we left the car parked our entire stay. Host however offered up their spot. Subway was a 10 minute walk away, for a another 10 minute ride into Manhattan, super easy. All amenities needed for a comfortable longer term stay, however no laundry facilities. Perc coffee and all the fixings available to make...nice touch since we got in late and did not have time to get groceries.  Jeanne did offer to pick us up some groceries if we needed them.  All in all very pleasant stay and location. "
14314,94012990,14/8/16,13783533,Fabien,"Nous sommes arrivés à Brooklyn en fin de journée. 
Nous avions échangé avec Jeanne, qui nous avait communiqué toutes les précisions pour accéder à notre hébergement. 
Nous avons pu rencontrer Jeanne et Georges le lendemain. 
Ils sont absolument charmants et très accueillants. 
Georges a pris du temps pour vérifier que je m'étais stationné correctement  (ce qui évite certaines surprises !).
Il s'agit d'un appartement en sous-sol disposant de sa propre entrée. 
L'hébergement est très propre et correctement équipé. Nous n'avons manqué de rien.
Il est vraiment idéalement situé : à 10-12 minutes de marche vous accédez à une station de métro qui vous place à une station de Manhattan ; vous en avez une autre pour descendre dans le coeur de Brooklyn.
Je vous conseille d'acheter les Metrocard Illimités (31 $) pour voyager tranquillement. 
Du pont Pulaski, vous aurez une vue magnifique sur Manhattan.
Niveau commerces : vous avez un supermarché C-Town à 7-8 minutes, très bien achalandé et une petite épicerie juste au coin de la rue (+ chère).
C'est vraiment un lieu idéal pour poser des bagages avant de partir découvrir NYC !!!
Vraiment chouette !"
14314,95381981,19/8/16,21379507,Rick,"Liked having our own space.....didn't have to share closet space, etc. Nice space!"
14314,105020082,29/9/16,1235128,Bernadette,Jeanne was very welcoming and easy to communicate with. She was a pleasure to meet and speak to. Her place was perfect for our 2 week stay had everything we needeed. Apartment has access to 2 main subways G & 7 which will take you to Manhattan within minutes! Jeanne  was accommodating when our flights were due out late in the evening and was very kind to hold our luggage for a few hours. We really appreciated this. Highly recommend her place it's away from the hussle and bustle of Manhattan but close enough to get to. Greenpoint the neighbourhood has a lot to offer and would stay here again. 
14314,107556054,10/10/16,17444048,Josh,"Great space, great location, close to everything. It had everything we needed for our week in New York. Jeanne is a great host, super helpful, really easy to contact. Highly recommend."
14314,113381420,12/11/16,77951752,Jillian,"We had a fantastic stay at Jeanne's apartment. We traveled with our children and Jeanne was so kind to allow us to use her pack 'n play.  She also knew we would be arriving late at night so she set up the fold out bed for us. The apartment was perfect. Clean, cozy, comfortable. We have no complaints and would heartily recommend anyone to stay here. Thank you for a great time Jeanne and George! "
14314,114953863,20/11/16,29040029,Hege,"My husband, two children and I arrived JFK quite late in the evening but Jeanne gave us the code to the door so we had no problems getting in. Jeanne even made the bed in the livingroom for us so that we didn´t have to do that first thing when we got there. The apartment is perfect  - with everything you need. Fully-equipped kitchen, great WIFI, maps, books and toys and a clean and nice bathroom. 
There are a lot of cozy cafés close by and the apartment has access to 2 main subways G & 7 which will take you to Manhattan in about 15-20 minute. 
We had a great stay! Thank you so much!
"
14314,133119193,20/2/17,1885864,Gerilyn,Jeanne's place was just perfect for our trip to visit family.  Hope to stay there again in the future.  Very cozy apartment with most everything you need!
14314,136900099,12/3/17,37608933,Fabrice,"We stayed for 3 nights in this perfectly located apartment. The neighbourhood was great, with everything you need on our doorstep from quirky coffee shops, to grocery stores to some lovely bars and restaurants. Then a short 10 minute walk to either the subway or the East River ferry will get you into Manhattan in no time. The apartment was lovely, clean and given the freezing weather, it was comfortably warm and cosy. Jeanne is a great host and was extremely accommodating when we needed to check out late as our flight wasn't until late at night. Overall, after staying in Manhattan once before, I would definitely stay in Brooklyn again, for a slightly different view of NYC."
14314,140941391,1/4/17,29894203,Andrew,This was the best air Bnb I've ever stayed in! The place was very charming and cozy. Jeanne was an amazing host and made sure we had everything we needed in a timely manner. It almost felt like we were just staying with family or friends because she was so welcoming. We will definitely be staying here on our next visit to Brooklyn. 
14314,145253348,17/4/17,33532690,Jia-Xuan,"This place was lovely to arrive to - it was clean and well furnished, more beautiful than in the pictures and spacious enough for four people considering it being in NYC. It's relatively convenient to walk to the subway to get to Manhattan, and living in Brooklyn offers a slightly different vibe that we wouldn't have otherwise experienced. Greenpoint is also a relatively safe neighbourhood as well. Lastly, it's also reasonably priced considering the cost of living in NYC. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and was really thankful that we chose this apartment! "
14314,145857745,20/4/17,17472533,Jennifer,"Jeanne's place is in a good spot in Brooklyn walkable from the subway and near plenty of shops and restaurants. I also felt very safe in the neighborhood. The apartment is also very nice to relax in and play board games, read, or make coffee - things you don't always have a lot of room for in a hotel. It feels much more like a home away from home than a hotel would. We were even able to iron clothes and hang them up. I loved walking to a bagel shop in the morning and picking up some bagels and then having a refrigerator in which to store them. Thanks for a great stay in Brooklyn!"
14314,147385556,26/4/17,109007982,Star,"I would absolutely recommend Jeanne’s place! This was our first time using Airbnb and our entire experience was wonderful! Jeanne even messaged us to make sure we were doing ok our first day there and was very responsive to messages when we did have a question. The house has a private entry and everything you could possibly need for a stay! It is conveniently located, with a grocery store about 5 blocks away and it's near many restaurants! "
14314,150659034,8/5/17,181645,Joyce,"Jeanne was a terrific host. Very easy communication and she was accommodating and helpful with all. The place was very convenient - great location, clean, and easy check in and check out. We stayed there with friends who were visiting NY for the first time. They walked everywhere. Felt very safe and easy to come and go. Highly recommend."
14314,152453896,16/5/17,114545007,Hermenegildo,"El apartamento-sotano para acceder a él es muy estrecho y pequeña. Tiene sus pros y sus contras. 
Sus pros son la ubicación aunque el fin de semana una de las bocas del metro no funcionaban. El cuarto de baño esta muy bien , equipado con todo, y el agua siempre caliente, no habia que esperar. 
Sus contras:
Las hormigas; tuvimos hormigas durante 7 noches y eso que teniamos cuidado con la comida y la guardabamos en la nevera. 
Espacio: los armarios del apartamento estan casi todos ocupados con cosas de los propietarios con lo cual estar cuatro personas con cuatro maletas mas cuatro maletas de cabina pues fatal.... 
Los techos en algunos lados bajos, si mide 1,80 cm te puedes dar con una de las vigas en la cabeza.
Algunos utensilios de cocina , como una cacerola tenia el fondo marron de estar estropeada. 

En lineas generales bien pero para dos personas por que para cuatro personas no lo recomiendo en absoluto. 

He de decir que ella se comportó muy bien anterior al viaje y nos preguntó por el tema hormigas... 
"
14314,154233682,23/5/17,77953762,Elly,"Het verblijf bij Jeanne was super. Het huisje is volledig uitgerust. We misten werkelijk niks. Omdat het warm was tijdens ons verblijf, werd er meteen een airco geregeld. Jeanne reageert snel als je iets vraagt. De laatste dag mochten we onze koffers achterlaten in haar eigen huis omdat er weer volgende gasten kwamen en wij pas een late terugvlucht hadden. Als we ooit nog naar NY gaan dan komen we hier zeker terug! Aanrader is zeker om de ferry naar Manhattan te nemen; veel leuker dan de metro."
14314,154644737,25/5/17,14452477,Larisa,"In May we stopped for two days and two nights to see the city. My husband, I and my sister. Our host Jeanne's apartment was clean, decorated with tastefully. Everything was provided that was necessary for travelers. The place was located on the lower level of the home and though there is low ceiling it was still and enjoyable experience. One thing to consider is the soundproofing between the upper and lower level. We are sensitive to noise in the morning, so unfortunately when the family awoke up at 6 am we heard every step. Otherwise, it was good.
The apartment is located relatively close to Manhattan - 15 minutes to the metro on foot and just a couple of stops from Times Square. As far as price, it was quite affordable. The cleaning fee was not included in the main amount of Airbnb and do not forget to pay it in cash. "
14314,156837348,1/6/17,3274071,Jeanne,My parents and my sister stayed at Jeanne's place when visiting me in NY. I live in the same street and I was happy to have them close to me in my beloved neighborhood that has so much to offer.  The place was very clean and complied to Airbnb pictures. We loved having a code on the door instead of keys ! Jeanne and her family live upstairs in the house and the apartment has it own entrance above the main stairs. It is very easy to communicate with her. I will definitely recommend staying in their place. 
14314,160530344,14/6/17,116649270,Celine,"L'appartement de Jeanne était exactement comme on l'imaginait, très cosy. Nous étions quatre pendant une semaine et l'espace est largement suffisant. L'emplacement est parfait à quelques minutes du métro et du ferry pour une traversée extraordinaire jusqu'à Manhattan en passant sous le pont de Brooklyn. Le quartier est calme mais avec tout ce qu'on a besoin pour le séjour (supermarché, restaurant...)
Jeanne a été très discrète et présente à la fois, en nous envoyant dès notre arrivée un petit message pour savoir si tout allait bien. On a eu la chance de la rencontrer elle et son mari, ce sont des personnes charmantes et attentionnées avec leur invités. Je recommande cette adresse et y retournerai avec plaisir."
14314,167011938,5/7/17,93817178,Per Øystein,Fin leilighet. Rolig strøk. Kort vei til Manhattan. Veldig greie verter. De er nøyaktige og svarer raskt på spørsmål. Anbefales!
14314,169166036,11/7/17,39368152,Danielle,"It's true, Greenpoint really has it all! Jeanne's place is located on a very cute residential street that's just minutes away from delicious restaurants, night life and great shops. It's also a beautiful and comfortable apartment. I absolutely recommend staying there."
14314,175190709,28/7/17,39308439,Tigrou,"Pour éviter certaines correspondances en métro, n hésitez pas à prendre le ferry sur le east River... Il y a un arrêt sur la 34eme pour l empire state building, un pour Wall Street et un autre pour Brooklyn. C est d ailleurs très sympa de le prendre la nuit.
Rue India côte ouest. La rue est en travaux mais c est bien au fond, malgré le panneau ! Danger...
Cout 2,75$ par pers. Vous pouvez les prendre avant de partir sur le quai, via une application ou à bord... "
14314,176573839,31/7/17,13226893,Jennie,"Greenpoint is a charming neighborhood. This place is in a great location on a quiet street. Very clean. Jeanne was a wonderful host who communicated with us promptly and let us store our bags before/after check in, which was really helpful. I highly recommend this place."
14314,182382580,14/8/17,12646579,Tobias,"The apartment in Greenpoint has the perfect location for exploring New York City. Just a short walk over the Pulaski Bridge to Long Island City and the 7th train puts right on 42th street. Or walk the other way to the river and take the East River ferry for a scenic tour down to Brooklyn bridge / Wall Street. 
We had a great stay in the apartment and It was easy to communicate with Jeanne."
14314,188678848,30/8/17,60787780,Ben,"Good location, very easy to get into Manhattan on ferry.

Not best for tall people (I'm 6ft 3), I did bang my head a few times on a low beam 

Hosts very friendly"
14314,189628106,2/9/17,37185502,Jessica,Our two boys (ages 8 and 9) and us really enjoyed our stay in Greenpoint. It was a very close walk to the subway and many stores. About a five minute walk to the ferry to head over for some delicious pizza at Julianas. It was a nice quiet stay at night away from it all after an exhausting day touring Manhattan. We would definitely stay again!
14314,192277082,10/9/17,120518436,Brian,First class stay at Greenpoint with Jeanne. Attention to every detail!  Fell in love with 172. Highly recommend!
14314,193194921,12/9/17,6260609,Paula,"Clean and many thoughtful amenities-
We were right where we needed to be for an event in Long Island City.  Tasteful apartment."
14314,193744519,14/9/17,1606660,Lacy,"Great little place for your stay in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Just make sure you read the rules and are prepared to leave $50 cash for cleaning service. Other than that, the apartment was cute and clean!"
14314,195744201,20/9/17,65440850,Rishi,"Good communication and seamless check- in. Nicely decorated and clean accommodation. Had a small kitchenette with basic amenities. A small grocery store was just around the corner from where we got stuff to fix up a quick breakfast.
Located in a quite , residential neighbourhood. 
It took us around 10 - 15 minutes to walk down to their place from the nearest sub station ( which seemed like a lot when you had a lot of luggage!). Times Square was just 2 stops away. 
There was a separate $50 cleaning fee which we had to pay in cash."
14314,196962554,24/9/17,72179799,Don,Enjoyed the stay there. Apt is below the host’s apt. Not real noisy.  Can here foot steps. The apt is spotless and looks freshly remodeled.  Tks
14314,198512313,29/9/17,12752216,Werner,"Wir haben 4 Tage bei Jeanne im Apartment verbracht und hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt. Die Lage ist top. Greenpoint ist etwas ruhiger als Manhatten, es gibt viele Supermärkte und Restaurants und man erreicht die Grand Central Station in etwa 20 Minuten. Das Apartment an sich ist recht klein und hellhörig und deshalb wurde es doch etwas eng. Dadurch dass es im Kellergeschoss ist, ist es auch sehr dunkel aber für die 4 Tage hat alles gereicht. Schade fand ich auch dass wir von den Gastgebern nicht empfangen wurden bzw. gar keinen Kontakt zu ihnen hatten und somit uns auch keine Tipps oder ähnliches abholen konnten. Außerdem kamen wir zu fünft und mussten $100 extra zahlen obwohl die fünfte Person auf dem Boden schlafen musste. Aber alles in allem ein Apartment welches wir für einen Kurztrip nach New York weiter empfehlen können."
14314,199239620,1/10/17,152516826,Andrew,This apartment is a great option. Jeanne is great at communicating and very welcoming and helpful.
14314,200794079,6/10/17,30966764,Dana,Jeanne and her husband are wonderful.  It was such a wonderful little place for my two children and I to stay.  The apartment was perfect. Jeanne even had set up a second bed for my daughter prior to a late arrival.  She helped us get settled and we're so friendly. Will absolutely recommend to friends and return the next time we are in the area.
14314,201915780,9/10/17,35822468,Tanya,"I am second hand writing this review due to booking this space and having the pass the reservation on to my mother/grandmother due to illness. However, from their experience this place is spot on. Wonderful hospitality, clean, comfortable and walking distance to everything! My grandmother cannot walk far distances, but this place was extremely close to the ferry, transit, shopping and dining. She was able to fully enjoy herself ""in the city"" and have a comfortable place to stay at the end of it all. Everything felt right at home, like a special guest. You just can't beat this place. Wonderful for children through grandparents :)"
14314,202709883,12/10/17,28140565,Abby,Great place in great neighborhood. Perfect size and location for four people. Everything was as expected and better. Host is very helpful. Will go again.
14314,206480706,25/10/17,23320455,Claire,"The apartment was ideally located and the subway was nearby and easy to use-2 stops to Times Square!!! The apartment is a basement apartment so does have limited ventilation and not many windows but is perfect if you are just using it as a base to sleep.
I didn’t actually meet the host but communication was easy and was she replied quickly. She also helped us with our check in/out requests."
14314,208501239,1/11/17,100590602,Puneet,This is a great place to stay if you are looking for affordable and peaceful place near New York. It is close to almost everything and it’s very comfortable.
14314,209177440,4/11/17,24713244,Mickey,"My stay at Jeanne's place was fantastic!  The apartment was clean, cozy and well equip.  It was perfectly located with easy access to the G & 7 trains as well as many great shops, restaurants & bars easily walkable.  The neighborhood has the perfect balance of energy and peacefulness.  Jeanne and George were very welcoming, offering great recommendations for local spots and any advice needed throughout my stay.  Communication and access to the apartment were as easy as it gets!  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would love to stay there again on my next trip to NY.  Thanks Jeanne & George!"
14314,211323948,12/11/17,28652479,Lynn,"Definitely one of the best airbnb buys in Brooklyn! Outstanding value, clean, welcoming, GREAT location in an old Polish residential row house neighborhood with easy safe access to subway, oodles of delicious restaurants and bakeries. We'll definitely go there again, but book well in advance because I noticed they fill up fast. Lynn"
14314,214279398,25/11/17,8139166,Claire,Jeanne is an excellent host. The apartment is well equipped with everything you need for your time spent in NYC. It's location is close to transit and local Brooklyn sites. We will definitely be back when we visit again!
14314,215769936,1/12/17,155352404,Anne,"Jeanne's apartment is well equipped for anyone, like me, who likes to cater occasionally for themselves while on hols.  The local shops are well equipped with fresh produce, there are bakeries, gourmet shops, fruit & veg shops near by.    It's very easy to find and is near the local subway stations and a number of coffee shops.  It is only a short trip to Manhattan.   There is also a water taxi to the Financial District or boat to Staten Island.  Jeanne had everything you need in the apartment you needed, phone charger/hair dryer etc.  I would definitely stay there again!"
14314,216346429,3/12/17,39138807,Joanne,"Cozy comfort, responsive hosts, a quiet neighborhood with flower shops & Polish bakeries.  Walk to India Street ferry slip & take a ride under Brooklyn Bridge while viewing Manhattan skyline for the price of a ferry ticket: $2.50.   Wow."

14314,219719311,18/12/17,157678115,Dana,"This is an awesome space.  Our first time in an airbnb, and we are now officially converts.  The apartment was cozy, very functional, well-maintained and incredibly clean!  Location was great - lovely neighborhood convenient to shops, restaurants and public transportation.  We discovered we enjoyed the trek to the G line station rather than the Pulaski Bridge to the 7 line, which gave us a nice trip through the neighborhood.  (Although make at least one trip over Pulaski - GREAT view of the Manhattan skyline, including the Empire State Building!)  A lot of care has been given to the small touches in the apartment, and our host Jeanne was so friendly and provided great information.  We would stay there again, no doubt.  Overall, a great experience!"
14314,220929768,24/12/17,154036251,Casey,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it couldn’t have been better!  Jeanne is not only an amazing host who made us immediately feel welcome but her place is safe, beautifully decorated and in a great area!  We were traveling with two small children and the commute into Manhattan every day wasn’t tough at all...we took the subway half the time and it only took us about 20 minutes.  We also took the ferry a few times which is a short 10 minute walk away!  Two quick ferry stops and it brings you right into midtown!   My kids loved playing with all the toys and also loved putting our little pin on the map and seeing where all her other visitors had traveled from.  This spot is a perfect place to slow down the pace after a busy day in the city, yet still close to shops, restaurants and laundry!  There was also always a good amount of available parking on the street!  We will definitely be back on our next trip to New York!"

Der Jahreswechsel 2017/2018 war sehr kalt und Jeanne in Toronto bei ihrer Familie. Sie hat sich immer gemeldet , ob es uns in ihrer Wohnung warm genug sei. Der Empfang war sehr herzlich. Immer wieder gern.
Danke"
14314,230682831,28/1/18,27703100,Adrian,My wife and I stayed here two nights and we think it's a great value. It's a little off the beaten path but the G line gets you only a couple blocks away. The street is quiet and we had luck parking very close by. Left the car there and took subway everywhere. Plenty of room for us in the apartment. Great kitchen with anything you need. Nice shower. Comfy bed. Plenty of closet space. Great WIFI.
14314,237863912,24/2/18,62538895,Tania,"Jeanne’s place is very cozy and clean - she has paid lots of attention to detail! Just be aware it is a basement apartment and you will hear all noises from upstairs including children playing, footsteps, a piano, etc."
14314,243584348,16/3/18,85205854,Becca,Had an excellent time at Jeanne's place!  Her communication was fantastic and the space was perfect to come back to after a long day of exploring the city.
14314,245031799,20/3/18,74295312,Karen,"We just arrived home after our stay at Jeanne's apartment, and we're still raving about how perfect her home was.  The apartment is located on a beautiful, tree-lined street, where parking was suprisingly super easy!  It was within walking distance to all of the shops and restaurants in Greenpoint.  The apartment itself was so tastefully decorated and clean.  Jeanne has such great attention to detail, and she thought of everything!  Coffee, tea, shampoo, conditioner, soap, we barely had to touch our own supplies.   While the apartment is classy and clean, it was also very child-friendly.  We were traveling with my young daughter, and upon arrival, she had the pack-n-play already set up, sheets and all!  Further, she has toys in the apartment that my daughter loved.  It was super safe and comfortable for everyone.  Lastly, Jeanne is super responsive and attentive, so you never have to worry about a thing.

Jeanne always very quick to respond to queries and the place was ideally located. Very clean apartment with everything you need. Some great NY books to browse in the apartment too!"

I stayed for 5 days with my grown up daughter and although Jeanne was on her holiday for most of the time, everything was ready for our arrival and Jeanne kept us very much in touch  to make sure we were fully informed.  One thing we loved was the location - it was a quiet location with loads of food outlets and grocery shops just round the corner.  Even better was that it was only a 10 minute walk to India Street to catch the ferry across the East River to Manhattan, only $2.75 a journey. We used this every day, one way to 34th Street and the other way to Wall Street.  We met Jeanne before we left and she was a delightful person who obviously wants to do only the best for her guests.  We loved this accommodation and could not praise it any higher. "

Not enough blankets, the climate was cold and she only had 2 blankets for 4 people. The apartment was full of things, there is no space to place things in the bathroom and only 4 hangers in the closet!!! You can unpack your clothe because there is no space to leave it.
The room smells to naphthalene  and the living room to dog (franchesca has a dog) we found two cockroaches, one in the kitchen and the other in the living room. In conclusion it was dirty and with no space.

Conseil pour les futurs hôtes : pour fixer le 1er RDV avec Francesca, tenir compte du temps des formalités douanières et du trajet depuis l'aéroport (5 heures pour nous!).
Idem, si vous êtes un peu frileux, demander des couvertures dès votre arrivée.

Es un barrio tranquilo, rodeado de todo lo necesario y con una ubicación muy céntrica. El metro más cercano está a menos de 10 minutos caminando y hay supermercados y restaurantes en la misma manzana.
El apartamento es como se muestra en las fotos. Es cómodo y tiene todo lo necesario. Lo que nos pareció un poco raro es que hubiese una webcam en el salón, pero la dueña nos dijo que no estaba encendida. Tuvimos un problema con la cisterna y nos lo solucionó. La cama es cómoda y el salón también tiene un sofá cama. Nos pidieron que fuésemos muy discretos con los vecinos, para que no percibiesen el tema del subarrendamiento. Por el resto, todo bien"

El piso como muestran las imágenes. Zona tranquila l con un montón d super y restaurantes. A menos d 10 min. dl metro, Flatiron y Empire. Gran TV. El único pero es que hay muchas cosas suyas x la casa y te resta un poco d espacio, sobre todo en la cocina. 

Recomendable. 

Is like to have a friend in NY. She is very comunicative, answers at the moment and give you all you need. Welcome pack. In less than 10 min. you are in the metro, Flatiron or Empire.

The apartment itself was spacious, bright and comfortable, and perfectly located in the heart of Williamsburg. It was a short walk to the very trendy Bedford Avenue, and just across the bridge on the subway to Manhattan. We enjoyed our stay very much, and would highly recommend the apartment!   "

14377,176908,31/1/11,279835,Emily,"Joanna's place was amazing and she is a very thoughtful and welcoming hostess! The apartment was a great refuge during the snow storm and a wonderful place to work during the day. It was cozy, warm, and well-stocked with blankets. The location was also perfect and very close the both the L and JMZ trains. Joanna thought of everything: she met me in advance to give me the key, left detailed notes in the house and even left some homemade chocolates in the fridge!  "
14377,209298,26/3/11,247494,Rebecca,"The apartment was pretty much exactly as shown in the pictures -- bright, colorful, and comfortable. I was especially grateful for the small desk to sit at and do work in the evenings, and for the apartment's proximity to the the train for easy access to Manhattan. Unfortunately I was working most of the time I was in town, so I didn't get to explore the neighborhood as I'd have liked, but Joanna was great about leaving helpful advice about finding food and services around the neighborhood.

I didn't get to meet Joanna, but she was *incredibly* communicative leading up to my stay. She checked in via email to make sure I got into the apartment OK, and then again later in the week to make sure everything was going well. 

If you're looking for a nice place to call home for a few days, this place is great. I look forward to staying there again if I get a chance."

Located between the two trains we constantly used to get in and out of our Manhattan activities, and also right in the middle of wonderful Williamsburg, it was quite perfect.  Joanna was great to deal with, the apartment was clean and organized.  Only problem: so many great and unique little restaurants in the neighborhood I think I gained 10 pounds."
14377,395827,25/7/11,787697,Beau,"Joanna's place is perfect for a comfortable weekend away with all the mod cons. We were only there for 2 nights, but felt right at home: air conditioning (2 units, critical with 100 degrees outside!), nice TV, comfortable bed etc. It was easy to find and really convenient to 2 different subway lines which made it a snap to get into Manhattan, no matter where we were going."
14377,457445,19/8/11,486603,Jordi,"Joanna is an excellent and responsible host. I've had the chance to meet her personally. She's really nice and with an interesting background.
The communication was quick and easy all the time. She gave lots of tips about restaurants, bars and things to do in Brooklyn, including some free and outdoors activities that have been very helpful during my stay in NYC.
The apartment is exactly as you can see in the pictures: clean, well equipped and stylishly decorated.
The location is also great if someone is planning to stay in Williamsburg. There are two subway stations near the apartment (Marcy Av. and Bedford - less than 10 mins walking-) that go to Manhattan directly. The apartment is just a few blocks from Bedford Avenue, where you can find all kind of restaurants, cool bars and trendy shops.
Joanna's apartment has made my staying in nyc very pleasant and comfortable. If I ever come back to NYC I definitely will stay again and I highly recommend it to anyone who want to visit the city.

She kept in close contact and made sure I had everything I needed. Her apartment is large, comfortable, well designed, and above all exceedingly clean and tidy. It was also very quiet during my trip. I felt like I was living in luxury. The neighborhood is close to transportation and convenient. Highly recommended. "

Joanna was an excellent host (we didn't meet her but she was easy to communicate with, left us maps and information about restaurants/cafes in the neighbourhood, a note about how the TV works etc .), The apartment was very clean and cosy. Perfect for a couple. The neighbourhood is very lively and a short walk to various subway stops. The only minor point was the noise of a fan of a neighbour but it didn't keep us awake even though we're light sleepers. I'd definitely recommend staying in Joanna's apartment."
14377,822478,2/1/12,1268254,Erica,"La mia amica Silvia ed io abbiamo trascorso una settimana incantevole a casa di Joanna. L'appartamento, davvero grazioso, è situato in una zona comodissima per le principali linee della metropolitana. Joanna, inoltre è sempre stata molto gentile e sollecita ad ogni nostra domanda o richiesta. 
La via dove si trova l'appartamento non è bellissima, ma tutto sommato tranquilla e soprattutto molto vicina ai supermercati. Con una breve passeggiata si arriva nel centro di Williamsburg, che è un quartiere giovane, ricco di ristoranti e negozi molto alternativi ed interessantissimi.
Spero di poter tornare presto a NY e sicuramente sceglierei ancora questo quartiere di Brooklyn e la casa di Joanna come alloggio! "

14377,2856001,11/11/12,3461746,Camille,"Joana est une tres bonne hôte,
Elle fait attention au confort de ces locataires et il est très facile de communiqué avec elle, elle répond tout de suite à toutes les questions que l'on peut se poser. Nous devions arriver a NY le jour de la tempête Sandy et Joana a été très réactive pour que l'on puisse gérer la situation ensemble.
Son appartement est très agréable, pratique et confortable et la décoration est sympa. Après une bonne journée de marche dans Manhattan, ce fut un plaisir d'avoir un petit cocon douillet à Williamsburg, de vivre un peu comme un New Yorkais! 
L'appartement est bien situé, a 5min du metro qui va directement sur les plus grand site de Manhattan et en s'enfonçant un peu plus dans le quartier, il y a pleins de restos et de petites boutiques de fringues et de créateurs. Ainsi qu'un petit parc avec un vu sur Manhattan !!
Pour les parisiens, je comparerais williamsburg au quartiers Bastille/ Oberkampf/ Menilmontant.

Ce fut notre première experience avec air bnb et nous n'avons vraiment pas été déçu!

Bon voyage!

Joana is a very good host,
She pays attention on the tenants comfort and it's very easy to communicate with her, she answers quickly at all your question. We had to arrive has NY the day of the Sandy storm and Joana was very reactive so that we can manage the situation together.

Her apartment is very pleasant, practical and comfortable and the decoration is nice. After a good day of walking in Manhattan, it was a pleasure to have a small cosy cocoon to Williamsburg, to live a little as a New Yorker! 

The apartment is at 5min of the metro station which goes directly on the biggest site of Manhattan and by sinking a little more into the district, there are lots of restaurant and of small store of clothes and creators. And a small park with Manhattan view!

It was our first experience with air bnb and we were not really disappointed!

Have good trip !!

The place is modest, really clean inside  and equipped with everything you may need for your stay in NYC.  Joanna was an attentive host checking in with us via email a number of times to ensure everything went well. She even left some of her devine home made chocolates out for us! 
Overall we had a great stay here. "
14377,2986945,28/11/12,3105784,Richard,"We really enjoyed our week at Joanna's apartment in Brooklyn. Despite not meeting her in person, she communicated with us during our stay and we felt she was always there to offer help if any were needed. We arrived earlier than planned, due to unexpectedly sailing through Customs & Immigration at the airport, but we were able to get into the apartment early, rather than wait on the street.

The apartment is easy to find, head out of the Havemeyer exit of Marcy Avenue subway, turn right and walk up Havemeyer keeping the McDonalds on your right, go under the enormous freeway flyover, and turn left at the next street you come to. The photos are very accurate, the bed is very comfortable and we enjoyed having wifi internet to help plan what we were going to do in New York.

The neighbourhood is great, further along Havemeyer are loads of cool bars and restaurants - Rye is amazing, also Dram, Post Office, Roebling Tea Room, High Horse Saloon and Fette Sau are highly recommended. There's a supermarket on S 1st St, and the Bagel Store on the corner of S 4th and Bedford is a great way to fill up cheaply in the mornings.

Overall, a great apartment, easy to get into the city from, and a great host - what more could you want?"

Very comfortable bed, plenty of heat, clean bathroom with plenty of hot water, cozy living room, sunny kitchen, all surrounded by a wonderful neighborhood packed with amazing restaurants, shops, and bars. 
When I arrived very hungry after a much delayed flight, Joanna even helped me find a place that was still serving food at 2:00 a.m."
14377,3764328,12/3/13,27418,Clint,"Five Stars for Joanna. She was out of town when we arrived, but she had mailed  us keys two weeks in advance by registered mail so we had no trouble getting in. The place was roomy, well-lit, nicely decorated and spotless. Bed was comfortable, and there was plenty of hot water and good water pressure for showers.
 Joanna left complete instructions on how things work, plus a nice page of local recommendations. There was also a warning about potentially noisy neighbors, but that was never a problem. She emailed us several times to ask how our stay was going, and promptly replied to our questions.  
We have stayed at AirBNB properties about five times, and this one was the best by far.
Only downside was was not actually getting to meet our host :-( Maybe next time.
Highly recommended. "

14377,6567820,17/8/13,274028,Maika,"We stayed at Joanna's apartment for a whole week this August. Due to a short notice cancellation of our original booking, we arranged everything less than 2 weeks before we arrived. Joanna managed to prepare everything as if it was planned months ahead. She mailed us the keys to Germany to ensure a smooth and flexible check-in. She was very responsive and caring throughout our stay, even though she was in Europe by the time we were there. The apartment is wonderful, exactly as described in the listing. Very spacious, very comfy. Super clean. Love the area! Highly recommended. Will definitely be in touch for our next stay in the city.

Joanna even left us some delicious chocolates in the fridge for our arrival, as well as a really helpful list of bars and restaurants in the area.  The apartment itself is really well located in the heart of Williamsburg, so we only had a short walk to all the shops and cafes on Bedford Avenue, as well as only a few blocks to the subway.

14377,7674063,29/9/13,3053604,Alesya,"We spent 5 days in Joanna's apartment. Apartment is very comfortable, exactly as on the pictures. Location is good, very easy access to Manhattan. very good for those who are in new york for less than a week, but do not want to pay a fortune for apartment on Manhattan.
Joanna is a very good host and made overall process very smooth. I would definitely recommend Joanna's apartment to my friends. "
14377,8222969,21/10/13,9017266,Genevieve,"This was our first experience with AirBnB and it was great, thanks to Joanna we will definitely do it again! Joanna was great about communicating with us and coordinating our arrival, she gave very helpful detailed instructions before we arrived which was great after a long day of traveling. The apartment was spotless, well-kept and very comfortable. We loved having a little piece of Brooklyn to ourselves for the long weekend. It was in a great location, very easy subway ride from Penn Station and close to several subway lines going into Manhattan, also very close to the center of Williamsburg. We split our time between Brooklyn and Manhattan and it was very easy to get both places from her location.
We highly recommend staying in Joanna's flat, it was fantastic!!!!!"
14377,9011361,1/12/13,10260968,Deborah,"Joanna couldn't have been more wonderful and her apt couldn't have been more perfect!  The place was bright and clean with great decor and every amenity (including hair dryer and bag of toiletries Joanna supplies for her guests).  The location was brilliant and Joanna was there for us responding to texts throughout our stay whenever we asked her for tips of places to go. 

Joanna was there to meet us and let us leave our bags at the apt even after she had returned home at the end of our visit so that we could make even more of our last day in Williamsburg. 

We had a wonderful time in every respect and Joanna was a complete star.  We will be back for sure! "
14377,9548336,2/1/14,639904,Steven,"We had a great experience with Joanna and her apartment during our recent stay in NY. The location is fantastic; great for wandering around Williamsburg as well as simple access to Manhattan. 

The apartment was perfect for our needs; comfortable, clean and very well appointed (sharp knives in the kitchen - amazing!). 

Joanna is a terrific host as well. She was very quick to respond to questions and laid out a wonderfully helpful 'instruction manual' which we referred to quite often.

Highly recommended!"
14377,10778117,7/3/14,4927233,Julien,"We had à wonderful stay in lovely Joanna apartment ! It´s à very cosy place very well located. The neighbourood is awesome with many bars and restaurants. Joanna is a great host, she gave us many advices for the restaurants and she was very easy to contact."
14377,11884756,18/4/14,11516273,Adeline,"Joanna was a very great host! She left us some home made chocolate as a welcome gift and many instructions for our stay. She provides some adresses in the neighbouroud to eat or take a drink.
The apartment is really great : cleaned, cosy and well decorated. The area is quiet but animated and the subway is just one block away. The Williamsburg bridge is not far away and it can be crossed on foot easily.
We spent 3 great days in the apartment with all we need on site.
We really recommand Joanna as host and her apartment for a nice stay in NYC.
Joanna was always there when we need, by email. All our questions before the stay have found a quick answer. There was no problem.
I really thank Joanna for the great experience, our first one with airbnb ;)"
14377,13453159,27/5/14,8879737,Antonio,We had a great stay at Joanna's place. The apartment was in great condition and very well located. The neighbourhood is great and has many restaurants and bars. 
14377,14760698,25/6/14,16924840,Kristen,"This was my first experience with Airbnb, and I don't think I'll ever get a hotel room again. (Yeah, it was that great!) Joanna was a fantastic host - great communication, very comfortable and clean apartment, and she even had a list of things to do in the neighborhood which was very helpful to someone who has never been there. I felt very much at home during my short stay in an unfamiliar city. The neighborhood is great! The business owners were very friendly and attentive, and the food was amazing. I will definitely visit Williamsburg again."
14377,21237006,13/10/14,21717143,Paul,Joanna's place was very nice and close to all the  happening places. Would defiinitely recommend it.

Many bars and restaurant in this animated neighborhood, and access to Manhattan is very quick.

Joanna was a great host, easy to communicate and friendly.

We highly recommend it."
14377,22873386,16/11/14,23642817,Eileen,The apartment is fantastic.  It was so clean. The location was perfect. Lots of restaurants and very easy to get around.  Joanna left a very helpful guide.  
14377,24392487,27/12/14,6824389,Aditya,"The home was very welcoming and very neat and clean. The neighborhood is quiet with easy walking access to the subway station, even late in the night. The grocery stores and restaurants are nearby. The home was very comfortable to stay."
14377,24506912,29/12/14,11255952,Daniel,Check in/out was seem less. The place is charming. My wife liked the decorations. The bed was very comfortable after a long day of touring the city. Thanks Joanna!
14377,29184563,5/4/15,27670451,Laura,Joanna was the best host and her apartment is amazing. We loved it! It's in a great location in Williamsburg - really central and close to the subway! The place is so warm and inviting that it really felt like home away from home. We had the best trip and will definitely be back. 
14377,29735345,12/4/15,1472225,Rachel,"Just as pictured and described. Perfectly clean, comfy, and the bed is divine!!"

14377,35704303,21/6/15,34819352,Adam,Joanna met me at the door with homemade cheese danishes and even helped me with my bags! The apartment is spacious and charming with greenery outside of every window. This was actually our first airbnb experience- and she made it a good one!
14377,37203764,5/7/15,19690464,Roxy,"Joanna and her apartment were an absolute delight. She was there when we arrived and showed us the place (which was spacious, cute and well-equipped), and offered us a host of great advice on restaurants and bars in the area to try (we took her up on a quite a few, and they did not disappoint). If we had any questions, she was always just a text away. She'd even left us flowers and champagne for our anniversary, which was incredibly sweet.

The area is perfectly situated (just a walk away from shopping and restaurants on Bedford Ave, a short subway ride into the city for Broadway). There are a lot of amenities in the area, like bodegas and laundromats (though we didn't take advantage of those). 

Air conditioning in the bedroom was a wonderful relief from the hot New York summer. The place also comes with Roku, etc., but you probably won't use it since you're in the heart of Williamsburg.

All in all, the whole experience was charming. We'd absolutely stay here again."
14377,37870497,11/7/15,23848461,Stewart,Great apartment in Williamsburg. All arrangements were simple and straightforward. Apartment exactly as described and good value for New York. Joanna also left very clear information on the apartment and the local area. Subway 5 mins walk. Ferry to Pier 11/Wall St a 15 minute walk and a nice change from the subway. The immediate area has plenty of bars and restaurants. Laundry a couple of doors away. Appreciated the lovely chocolates left for us as a welcome gift. Would definitely recommend Joannas apartment. 
14377,41499935,7/8/15,39960697,Camille,"Extremely organized instructions and easy to get in contact with. Superior location and felt at home. So many lovely notes on where to go, what to do, how things operate in the house, etc. It was so easy, painless."

14377,55404141,1/12/15,46723160,Peter,Joanna made us feel very welcome in her apartment. The apartment was very accurately described in the listing and the neighbourhood was very pleasant. 
14377,57601459,27/12/15,15084960,Lauren,"Joanna was able to accommodate us over the Christmas weekend with little notice and it was such a seamless experience. The apartment was cute, cozy and close to everything especially the subway. The J and Z are about 5 minutes in one direction and the L is less than 10 in the other. Her apartment is quite literally surrounded by great restaurants and just a couple blocks away from amazing coffee, and great antique stores. An Uber ride from the city was $15. The neighborhood is great and there is even an old woman across the way who leans out her window and watches the street from (Website hidden by Airbnb) NY. Thanks, Joanna! "
14377,58441294,2/1/16,28524284,Leslie,"Great apartment, beautiful kitchen. Very happy with our 2 night stay"

14377,81124450,21/6/16,68937641,Lily,"Joanna was an excellent host. The building was quiet, the bed was soft and the air conditioning worked, just the things my boyfriend and I needed for an excellent weekend in Brooklyn! The neighborhood has lots of cute coffee shops and bars within walking distance."
14377,82496905,27/6/16,74498496,Michael,"Everything was as shown and described. I had a late night flight and I got the keys ahead of time so that I'd have no problems getting in, even with any delays. It worked perfectly."
14377,99942630,6/9/16,8189481,Lesley,"Joanna's charming apartment had everything we needed for our three night stay. The location is very convenient with street parking and walking distance to many shops, restaurants and the train. We even enjoyed a walk to Manhattan via the Williamsburg bridge. The apartment was clean and comfortable and Joanna provided us with thoughtful and detailed information to make our stay as easy as possible. She even provided some delicious homemade chocolate!"
14377,100996299,11/9/16,15558297,Jordan,"Joanna was an amazing host and we had no problems whilst staying at her Brooklyn apartment. Everything was easy and well catered for.

Awesome response time and friendly too! 

The apartment was in an amazing location and was never more than a 15 minute walk from anywhere that we had on our Brooklyn bucket list.

I would highly recommend staying here. New York was having a bit of a heatwave whilst we stayed there and the AC was ideal!"
14377,105626123,2/10/16,94358081,Shirley,The location is great and Joanna's restaurant recommendations were spot on. Cute apartment. I would recommend.  
14377,115984093,27/11/16,6593195,Jaslin,It was a great place to stay.  It was close to everything you need from shops to restaurants to supermarkets and wine bars!  Joanna was communicative all through out and followed up on how we were doing during our stay.  Fantastic host.  Definitely recommend to anyone.
14377,116439029,30/11/16,32909519,Jun,Joanna's is a nice and cozy apartment which has basically everything you need during a trip. It's ten-minute walk from metro and the neighborhood is pretty.
14377,123087373,27/12/16,3627549,Carla,"Her home was very clean, bright and cute! Very spacious for Williamsburg! It was very quiet and a short walk to shops and restaurants. Joanne met with my daughter before our arrival and gave her the keys since she would be gone the day we arrived. "
14377,123511040,29/12/16,55816200,Natalie,"Joanna's place is well located in Williamsburg. It is very close to the subway stops that we needed to get into Manhattan, there was no shortage of places to eat/go out, and Joanna's apartment had everything we needed for our short stay. She left us a helpful guide of where to go/places to eat, which was perfect for my boyfriend and I to avoid spending hours bickering over where to go. 
The apartment itself contained everything we needed, had enough space for the both of us to move about comfortably/relax, the bed was super comfortable, and there was sufficient lighting/mirrors (something I struggle to find in most airbnbs). Overall, I have zero complaints about Joanna's cozy home. "
14377,142085254,6/4/17,32051102,Caitlin,I absolutely loved my stay here--Joanna was super communicative and we had everything we needed. It was also great that she left the keys at a KeyCafe so there was no need to arrange a meet-up. I just hope Joanna's apartment is available the next time I'm in town!
14377,156100317,29/5/17,9615317,Mathias,"Un super appartement bien placé avec le métro à 5mn à pied. L'appartement est assez grand, le lit est très confortable et surtout Joanna à été joignable tout le long du séjour et très agreable :-) un grand merci a elle 😊 le quartier est vraiment bien aussi avec de nombreux bars et restaurants à proximité. Je le conseille !! "
14377,169496726,12/7/17,30109145,Lee,Joanna's apartment was perfect for our stay.  A good size for 2 people sharing a bedroom and though it is centrally located in Williamsburg it was quiet at night which I really appreciated.  A lot of things in the Williamsburg area were very walkable as well as the access to the L line which was great.
14377,185052728,20/8/17,2264132,Tripp,"Joanna's apartment is exactly as advertised. Great location. Spacious and clean. A comfortable bed. Effective AC window units for summer heat. Plus, she has a great system for getting you a key that makes the whole check-in-check-out process a breeze."
14377,189086549,31/8/17,465002,Claudette,"Joanna's place is really charming. The building is very old and has that NY charm about it. Her apartment is very comfortable and she is a meticulous host. Recommend.
: )"
14377,190956872,5/9/17,17651896,Christophe,"Nous avons passé 5 jours formidables dans cet appartement idéalement situé tant pour visiter Manhattan que Williamsburg ou même Brooklyn!

L'appartement est hyper propre, grand, confortable, la literie au top. De plus Joanna est une hôte super!
En bref nous y retournerions avec plaisir!"
14377,197052958,24/9/17,32158175,Teresa,"Joanna was a terrific host. She made sure our stay was comfortable and was readily available to answer any questions. The apartment was just right, very clean and the location was great! If you are driving parking is limited and can be an issue. Would stay here again."
14377,203788183,15/10/17,103529975,Samantha,"Lovely apartment with easy access to loads of bars, restaurants and shops. Also very close to subway with quick link into Manhattan."
14377,218728743,14/12/17,96890160,Alex,The place is great. She’s a great host. The bed is a bit soft so if you like a firm mattress maybe try another place.
14377,219908065,19/12/17,8197017,Tong Si,Great location !
14377,220711921,23/12/17,76019976,Shadee,Joanna’s place was really nice and clean! Friendly host. The key drop off was a little confusing for me.
14377,222399442,29/12/17,86901643,James,"Had a minor hiccup with the key pick up but Joanna was immediate in her assistance and it quickly became a non-issue. The place was clean, within walking distance to virtually anything one would need. All in all an excellent value and totally worth it."
14377,224211126,2/1/18,13434314,Kaori,"Lovely and comfortable apartment at great location. She assisted us a lot. We went to her house in extremely cold whether, the living room was a little bit cold. Anyway we had great time in Williamvurgs."
14377,238418602,25/2/18,103174877,Jade,"Great find- was a lovely apartment and PERFECT location. While in a fun and hip area, was also very quiet and peaceful inside the apartment. We were initially concerned about driving our car as we heard parking can be tricky- we ended up parking a few blocks away and leaving our car there throughout the weekend without any issues. We hope to stay here again in the future."
14377,242344666,11/3/18,5797233,Alex,"This was a  great place in good old Williamsburg, For getting around the city it's about a 5 minute walk from the J and a 10 minute walk from the L trains, and it's NYC so taxis are very affordable too of course.

We liked the decorations, it felt super comfortable to stay at Joanna's. Some of the pleasant surprises were the beautiful trees just outside the window which were already green (it's late winter here in NY), and that the place was decently quiet which is definitely not always the case in the neighbourhood.  I found it easy to focus on my reading and get my things done before heading out into the city to catch up with friends.

Would stay again"
14377,245194673,21/3/18,111260309,Mandy,The host canceled this reservation 76 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
14377,249041130,1/4/18,19600965,Nathan,Great location. Just minutes to walk to the subway station. Really awesome value for staying just a few minutes from Manhattan. Some good local eateries close by as well. Host was quick to respond and very accommodating. Would definitely recommend.
14377,258150709,28/4/18,15064117,Isabelle,"The place was perfect for our stay. It is clean, we slept well and we felt safe. Excellent place for the price. It is easy to walk around and get to public transport. We drove from Montreal and found street parking not too far (street parking is a bit of a mess in Williamsburg on Thursday and Friday morning). 
Joanna was very kind and accessible. 
We totaly recommend her place and we wouldn’t hesitate to rent it again."
14377,260359854,4/5/18,53983948,Rima,Joanna’s place was great. The location couldn’t have been better. There are tons of great bars and restaurants within walking distance and it was a short subway ride into Manhattan. Joanna was very responsive to text messages and made the check in process a breeze. Would definitely stay again!
14377,267368270,21/5/18,187695667,Masse,Joanna is the greatest AirBNB host of all time. Her place was great and very clean. Had no issues getting in contact with her and she was very accommodating. If you're ever in NYC and need an AirBNB I highly reccomend staying here! 
14377,270023947,28/5/18,24732741,Ben,"All around, a great experience! This air bnb was clean, spacious, and centrally located in Williamsburg. Joanna had WiFi, coffee, clean sheets, and AIR CONDITIONING... because it was 90 degrees over the weekend, this was a life saver. We walked everywhere, found all types of food (NYC Bagels, Mediterranean, Italian, Mexican, Georgian, Pizza...). Overall, very easy to communicate with Joanna, and she was extremely laid back."
14377,276701355,14/6/18,37659027,Ali,"Top Appartement, super Lage, Williamsburg ist ein tolles Viertel. Restaurant Tipps Zenkichi.
Lg Ali "
14377,318795181,4/9/18,87866896,Peter,"Joanna's place was a really nice, spacious and clean AirBNB for two people. It was right in the heart of Brooklyn, and provided a nice place to stay while my friend and I visited both Queens and Manhattan quite often during our stay. The air conditioning was definitely an added bonus, and her home was well-kept, well-furnished, and very tidy and clean. I'd definitely recommend people stay here. Thanks again, Joanna!"
14694,548409,19/9/11,537077,Trevor,The room is really nice and giana is a great host. A really good way to experience ny. We will def stay there again. Recommended. 
14694,620863,11/10/11,1218431,Vernon,This was my first time in NY.  Giana made me and my girlfriend feel very welcomed from the start.  She is a great hostess.  She was very engaging and helpful with giving us ideas and direction on how to experience he city while maintaining our privacy.  The room was magnificent; beautiful hardwood floors and a sun/moonlight that is simply magical.  I heartily recommend this oasis in the heart of New York city.  You won't be disappointed.
14694,17579648,14/8/14,18552296,Sandra,"This house is located in an area with beautiful mansions, very safe and just 3 blocks away from the train. The place is beautiful and immaculately clean, hosts were friendly and even thought ahead of time how to handle a language barrier if there were to be any. There is a service dog but he's always with the hosts."
14694,20112471,23/9/14,20591260,Katie,"Staying in Giana's home was a lovely experience. The room was just as pictured, the bed was extra comfortable, and I was able to make a nice breakfast for my boyfriend and I in the kitchenette made available to us. Giana was a very pleasant and upbeat host, willing to assist with anything we needed, including ideas for our daily activities. As my sole purpose for going to New York was to do all the touristy things that one could dream of, I worried that staying in Brooklyn may prove to be inconvenient, which didn't turn out to be the case at all. The subway was so close, I could feel it under my feet. I enjoyed trying a good bit of the food places in and around the plaza (especially Gyro King!) All in all, the only thing I didn't enjoy was having to wait on the bathroom at times. Haha! I highly suggest this house to anyone looking for a New York getaway."
14694,21853979,25/10/14,22260472,Denise,My hosts were not available upon my arrival as they were going to be out of town.  However they went over and beyond and made arrangements to go over the specifics with my son who lives in the city.  They also emailed me upon my arrival to ensure that everything was ok and to see if I had any questions.  They made me feel at home. 
14694,50251307,10/10/15,45280837,Andrew,"This is a truly excellent place to stay in NYC. I lived in NY up until 2 years ago and grew up just blocks away, so I was immediately comfortable and knew my way around. However, the hosts were always there for me when I needed them. They were very interesting people who I enjoyed spending time with. They were completely ok with my dog staying with me and even watched him for a night when I went out.

The room is portrayed 100% accurately in the photos. The bathroom was just amazing. I really enjoyed using the claw-foot tub. The rest of the house is furnished beautifully, the back deck was a real plus.

I will definitely be staying with these folks again and recommend them highly to anyone visiting the area."
14699,118512,13/10/10,240923,Barbara,Spacious apartment with good subway access  Host Jan was very accommodating and moved in a chair for my tall husband. Well equipped kitchen and even a small dishwasher!  Bathtub was very high off the floor but a grab bar was installed during our stay. We found the rate a bit high for the neighborhood and amenities provided. 
14699,48623119,27/9/15,1110489,Markus,"We had a wonderful time in this lovely area of Brooklyn. We actually did not know that such a lovely area would exist: with wonderful houses right in the middle of the big city. Everything at our stay was great: from the house, to the host, to Luigi - the wonderful dog. We will come again!"
14699,103643964,23/9/16,95213735,Sim,"Giana was very nice and welcoming. We rented the place for our elderly parents, and it worked out very well for them.

That being said, be sure to READ THE DESCRIPTION THOROUGHLY.  You are renting the 2nd and 3rd floor of the home (not the ENTIRE home), and Giana stays on the first floor. 

Also, note that the NY tax of 14.75% is to be paid SEPARATELY to Giana. This is IN ADDITION to AirBnb fees.

Again, they had a very pleasant stay. Just be aware of the 'fine print'.

14708,660300,24/10/11,1249158,Vicki,"We had a fantastic time here.  Home was SPOTLESS; very comfortable, friendly and welcoming.  Only 3 blocks from the subway.  Easy to get all around New York, Coney Island and Brooklyn.  This was our first experience with AirBnB and it was wonderful.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Thank you.  "
14708,8178177,19/10/13,1636772,Ana Paula,"My wife and I spent a most enjoyable and comfortable visit with Chanoch & Giana in their lovely Victorian home conveniently located with easy access to everything New York City has to offer.  Chanoch & Giana were very helpful and gracious hosts, providing us with everything we needed to truly experience the area and feel at home.  The metro was a five minute walk, and the historic homes in the neighborhood filled with overhanging trees was a treat to appreciate during our daily walks.  We highly recommend them and are already making plans for a return visit.  Steven & Ana"
14708,13054294,18/5/14,15149645,Patricia,"Beautiful location, home and host.  We had just the right amount of support and privacy.  I would highly recommend enjoying this amazing home."
14708,14408004,18/6/14,15200582,Lisa,"Had a wonderful stay at Gianna's beautiful home.  From swings on the front porch to walks in the shady neighborhood, my stay was delightful and the hostess was, too.  Just want to mention that the in room air conditioner was great and cooled the room down immediately and the room was squeaky clean and comfortable.  Can't wait to visit again!"
14708,16672452,31/7/14,17404766,Gunbritt,"6 dagars mycket gott boeende i Brooklyn. Kontakten med ägarna fungerade utmärkt. Ingenting som inte motsvarade det som utlovats. De är mycket sympatiska och trevliga. Kom med tips och förslag på saker. Respekterade vår intigritet och var absolut inte påträngande. Rummet ligger på 3 planet och var precis som på bilden. Rent, frächt .Sängen var stor och konfortabel. Tempurmadrass. Köket låg en trappa ner och innehöll allt man behöver. Toalett och duschutrymmet var extra fint. Fina detaljer vackert kakel. 
Att åka till och från deras hus till New York var smidigt. Det kanske tog 6-7 minuter att gå till tunnelbanan. Det var direktlinje till många platser vi besökte. Det finns affärer och lite olika typer   restauranger. Alla var väldigt trevliga. Kändes tryggt och bra. Vi har bara gott och positivt att säga om vår vistelse hos dem. Åker  i fler gånger så är det ingen tvekan om vart vi vill bo."

Like many B&B's this is a shared bathroom experience. The bathrooms are very clean and interestingly decorated. One of the bathrooms does not have a lock but uses an occupied sign which might put off some. Also the home is over a hundred years old which lends to its charm but also makes for some creaky staircases late at night. If you like the B&B experience it's a fine place.

14708,122161129,21/12/16,68836,Carolee,"Giana's home is a delightful old three story home in a residential neighborhood in Brooklyn. Giana is a welcoming and friendly host who will interact with you as much or as little as you want.  She is very accessible through whichever form of communication is easiest and will help you through your arrival.  She made our arrival very easy. Her home has easy access to the subway which is a short walk away.  All guest bedrooms are on the third floor.  A nice kitchen and sitting room is on the second floor for use by guests. A very important member of the household is Luigi, a beautiful black Labrador who takes care of guests almost as well as Giana. 

Some observations: no shoes in the house, so be prepared to walk in socks or bring indoor slippers. 3rd floor accommodations might present issues if you have bad knees or some other physical problem. Bathroom facilities are excellent but may have to share depending on number of other guests. Also, old house - sensitive plumbing - check with host about this. Wi-fi accessible but no cable or basic tv - other options available are Netflix, YouTube, etc. on large tv screen in kitchen-sitting room, if you wish - check with host.

Thank you, Giana, for a wonderful stay."
14708,266739770,20/5/18,1611445,Stacy,"This is a super place to stay when visiting NYC.  Ditmas Park is a charming neighborhood and JK’s place was the perfect place to settle in for the week.  We went into Manhattan daily, which was very easy, given the proximity to the subway stop and the B/Q lines.  Comfy foam mattress, lovely room, and big bath with both a new shower and a clawfoot tub.  We would stay again, in a minute."

Una persona molto attiva ma sempre presente nei momenti di bisogno, sempre pronta a darti consigli e dritte per vivere al meglio questa fantastica esperienza. La camera si è rivelata ottima anche per due persone (ero con un amico): dimensioni adeguate, luminosa, ma soprattutto pulita. Sicuramente la terrò ancora presente per eventuali viaggi in futuro (ci tornerò, assolutamente). Magico lo spettacolo visto a broadway in sua compagnia... Grazie Bianca! A presto"
14991,131115,1/11/10,248937,Matthew,"The room is spacious and open, with a comfortable bed and more than adequate heating during the colder days. The apartment is fantastically located, right in the heart of the East Village, with easy access to all the fine dining, entertainment and bars you could ever want, just downtown from Manhattan's more major attractions.

Bianca is a welcoming and friendly host, and is quick with suggestions and help to ease traveling and seeing an unfamiliar city.

She's really easy going and great fun! I stayed at Bianca's for two weeks and Bianca did absolutely her best to help me to find all the coolest restaurants, shops and places to hang out. The room was very cosy and spacious and I slept really well in the double bed. The location of her apartment could have not been better. I could walk anywhere and many different subway lines and buses were just few minutes walk away. There're amazing brunch and dinner places just nearby and East Village night life never disappointed me. I really enjoyed my stay and definitely will contact Bianca when I'll go again. Miss you already!! Xxx "

No sólo Bianca es una persona realmente muy hospitalaria,  siempre atenta y dando ideas de dónde ir, o cómo ir a determinado lugar,  con su sonrisa en todo momento, el barrio me encantó, es muy pintoresco lleno de barcitos, negocios, con mucha identidad, y movimiento todo el tiempo. La habitación es tal como se ve en las fotos, es espaciosa e iluminada., y tiene total privacidad. Definitivamente, volvería a vivir allí, pasé unos días muy felices en ese lugar."

15110,822962,2/1/12,1296212,Carol,"My boyfriend and I stayed for 9 days. We didn't meet Rafael during our stay but Martha gave us a warm welcome and an orientation of the basement. The place had everything we needed and was private, which was what we we looking for. Martha and Rafael are sensitive to what guests need. Their place was equipped with everything, even the little things for guests to have an enjoyable stay. There were movies, take-out menus, towels, 

The location is nice and convenient. It's about a 10 min walk to the subway. We were usually out in the morning and return late at night but the neighbourhood is pretty safe. The convenience stores around the area open till late too. There are a great variety of food, so no worries to cure any hunger pangs! 

All in all, it was very comfortable and delightful stay at Rafael's place. Would definitely recommend this place! "

We were part of the New Years Eve celebrations - it was certainly an experience. We met with Clebers friend Eric who kindly waited for us to arrive. (I hope you made your flight Eric).
The apartment was small but adequate and arm. We can also recommend the pizza from 2Brothers up the road. damn cheap at $8 for a HUGE pizza.

thanks Cleber for letting us use your apartment.

cheers

15220,41938,12/5/10,118247,Marcelo,"Indeed best location in NYC. 

Walking distance to everything, clean place and host very friendly. I found this place for my female friends. They were delighted about the place and also about Cleber, the host, who made them feel very welcomed. 

You have Times Square less than 5 minutes walk. All the trains get you close to the apartment.  

Definitely will recommend this place to anyone coming to NY."
15220,61722,6/7/10,137439,Ashok,"Cleber is a good and friendly host. And the location is very good - it's close to everything, though Midtown West is not exactly my favorite place in the world. 

Cleber advertises this, so there's no surprise, but  you should be fully aware of the quirks of his place: the toilet is not in the same room as the shower (and indeed, is outside the apartment), and the AC didn't work when I was there. 

All in all, a fair price for an okay apartment in a good location with a nice host.

The location was perfect for me, so close to the subway, Times Square and Broadway. I would recommend Cleber and his abode to anyone. "
15220,120559,17/10/10,85234,Kurt,"Cleber was a down to earth nice guy. Very clean and giving. Offered me coffee & food graciously. Location of unit is very good. Close to E train. 42nd St transfers to almost all subway trains. Located on 2nd floor, easy to get to... quiet too. Lots of eat options. I liked the Thai food place nearby. I really liked my private flat screen TV for local news & weather."
15220,143383,23/11/10,261818,David,This room is great for one person. The host is charming and warm. I read the ad wrong and was under the assumption that I would be renting a small apt. and not just a room in somebody's apt.-Totally my fault. The apt. is very clean and well taken care of.It's very convenient to get around. More than one person would be very difficult.
15220,150437,7/12/10,291356,Javier,Cleber! Muito obrigado! This guy is the bomb! I will definitely stay back at this place next time!

15220,199260,14/3/11,403820,Alex,"Cleber's apartment is amazingly well located, just few from the heart of Times Square and all the subway lines (A, C, E, N, Q, R, W, S, 1, 2, 3, 7 and 9). If you are coming from JFK, LaGuardia or Newark Airports, just take the shuttle bus to Port Authority Bus Terminal and walk four short blocks to get to his place. Despite this proximity with this evermoving touristic center, the place is very quiet. Cleber is a very nice, polite, helpful and discreet host. For sure I will stay at his place on my next trip to NYC!"
15220,208804,25/3/11,5599,Silvia,I had one of my colleagues stay with Cleber (I already had an another place lined up). My colleague told me that Cleber is very friendly and that his place is nice and clean. He also said that he would like to stay there again whenever he has an opening while we are in NYC.
15220,236043,23/4/11,397672,Nick,"Cleber is a nice guy and helpful with some traveler information or good places for shopping or eating. The apartment is near the Time Square and so in a very good place. The room was clean and had a own TV. The bad was a bit small, but OK, the restroom was on the floor, outside the apartment and also very small. For me it was a good time. Thank you Cleber for all."

Working aircon. Cleber is a very very helpful and lovely guy. OK, toilet is outside - so what, it's two steps away and for exclusive use. 

Location perfect - short walk to Penn St and Port Authority Bus Station. Best pizza ever on the corner 2 blocks up. Times Sq 10 min walk.

He is very helpful and gave me great tips about the places I wanted to visit - he is an all-round lovely person. The spotless apartment has a lovely vibe to it. The room I stayed in has a comfortable bed, silky smooth bed linen, ample wardrobe space and a flat screen TV. The location is absolutely perfect - close to Broadway theatres, subway stations, a bus terminal and countless restaurants. I enjoyed every moment in NYC, even though my trip was cut short, as my original flight got canceled. I'd love to stay there again. Thank you Cleber!!"
15220,636533,17/10/11,1098336,Jānis,"I chose Cleber and his place to stay because of the location and was not disappointed - it is indeed 5 minutes walk from Times Square and other significant NYC landmarks and 1 minute walk to major bus and subway hub (Port Authority Bus Station).
The room is really small and that would trouble those who travel with lots of stuff, but for me it was perfect.

In short: if you are on a tight budget (or just are not into overspending) but still want to stay in the very heart of Manhattan, this is the perfect choice for you!"

15220,675804,30/10/11,684212,Joseph,"It's a great location, for sure. Host is very nice and accommodating. As it says in the description, there is a private toilet but it's not in the apartment, so you have to walk down the hall to use it. Which is fine, unless you need to get up in the middle of the night… stumbling down a brightly lit hall, fumbling with the lock on the door to go to the bathroom isn't my favorite thing to do at 4am. BUT, given the price for a clean bed in a safe apartment in a great location in New York City, it's hard to argue!"

Can't tell anything about Cleber himself, since he was out of town. He has been responsible in letting me know he will be out of town and in giving me his replacement's name - Gisela - who was just fantastic - very nice, friendly and helping.
Will be back anytime."

The apartment is very close to Time Square and all the other hotspots in NYC, so I walked a lot instead of taking public transportations. Moreover, Cleber is such a hospitable host.

Very clean and functional apartment.  Only drawbacks are that the guest room is small and the (private) toilet is down the hall - a bit of a pain if you have to get up in the night.  

Cleber was out of town, but Gisela and Cindy handled the checkin and get me set up.  Would definately stay here again.

15220,1918155,7/8/12,1829868,Daniel,"Was my first time in NYC and so was apprehensive as to what to expect as well as it being my first stay through AirBNB. Finding the apartment was easy as was situated about 15 minutes from Penn Station if you got the train from Newark with the bus station 10 minutes in the other direction. As for the apartment it was basic but thats all you need as you are mostly exploring the city till late. I only slept in the apartment so all i needed was a bed. The room itself was good sized came with a sofa, drawers and a loft bed which i haven't slept on one of those since i was like 10 years old. There was a tv on the wall above the bed. The only weird thing was that the toilet was on the corridor but it is only used by that apartment so was fine. The bathroom was small aswell but i got used to it. The area itself was great. My fear were that i would not be safe walking the streets at night but was ok nobody bothered you and everyone was friendly and willing to help. Location wise it was perfect, Empire state building was about a 20 minute walk, Times Square about the same and Central Park about 30 mins with a short 10-15 minute subway ride to Statue of Liberty and the World Trade Centre. Easy access to shops with a food store 5 minutes down the road, Macys about 15 mins and Madison Square gardens aswell. Cleber was an excellent host and gave me some tips on the city and gave me a guide book to help me. Will definatly be staying here again"
15220,2210114,5/9/12,3342141,Nelson,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it worked perfectly. The flat is exactly what you get in the pictures. It was very clean, organized and confy. I´ll probably be there again in my next visit to NY."
15220,2280811,14/9/12,2907156,Howard,"I had a great stay at Cleber's apartment. I was in NYC for a week and the apartment is conveniently located in Midtown. The neighborhood is full of nice restaurants and bars.  It's close to Time Square and other major attractions of NYC. Also most of the metro lines and Penn station are all within walking distance. What you see in the pictures is truly what you get and for me thats all I needed. The bed was comfy, there's airco, TV and it's clean. The only awkward thing about the apartment is that the toilet in the hallway, but it really didn't bother me at all.

Cleber is true host who takes great care in making sure that his guests have a pleasant stay is his apartment. I would recommend Cleber's apartment to anyone wanting to stay in NYC.  

Once again thanks for everything Cleber! "
15220,2423084,26/9/12,2192373,Hiram,"First time using airbnb.com, great experience!!! Thanks Cleber!! Nice bedroom and clean place. Very helpful host. Location is perfect!!! Short walk from port authority and Time square. Thanks again! "
15220,2468883,1/10/12,2926193,Michael,"Clever was a fantastic host. He offered great advice on things to do and places to go, as well as hints and tips on other things like how best to travel to Boston and get an iPhone5!

His appartment was amazingly well located. I walked back from Times Square in about 10/15 minutes at a leisurely pace, the PABT is less than 5 minutes away, the Highline (you HAVE to visit this) can't be much more than 10minutes walk the other way too.

The appartment was also very clean, tidy and above all quiet. The street was busy (good for walking home late), but the appartment was completely shielded from any noise.

I stayed in the larger room which was amazing for chilling out and the bed was good and it's clever design made the room massive (the ceilings are high).

I highly recommend both Cleber and his appartment and thorough enjoyed my stay, THANK YOU!"
15220,2519650,6/10/12,2992936,Kate,"The bedroom was really big, especially because of all the space below the loft space.
The apartment was very clean, and in easy walking distance of the Port Authority bus terminal, Penn Station, Times Square, Empire State Building and the High Line (highly recommended)."
15220,2722713,26/10/12,3681804,Zach,"Wonderful location just a few minutes away from Times Square. Access to public transportation is very convenient as the place is 2 streets away from PABT station. You do not need to worry about food and entertainment with restaurant row nearby. 9th Ave has loads of restaurants as well.

Finally, a very welcoming and accommodating host (Cleber was out of town so Gisela was there to take care of everything). No fuss regarding check-in and out timings.

Highly Recommended! "
15220,2876542,13/11/12,3715409,Jose Maria,"The apartment of Cleber is nice. The room is big and the bed very comfortable. It was also very clean and tidy and it has everything you may need for your stay,

But the best thing by far is the location. You are really less than 5mins walking distance from Times square. You are also very close to the Penn station where you can get trains to/from instance to Newark airport, and also close to the Port authority bus station where you can find connections with JFK airport. "
15220,2950425,24/11/12,3767143,Luiz Henrique,"
Cleber and Gisella are perfect!! Gisella received me in great apartment Cleber, was very, very helpful and made sure to make sure everything was according to our stay. A big hug for her. Cleber simply perfect, a great people I meet. The fourth, rather than the photos, lol. With a large space and a perfect bed for resting after long walks through NY. lol
The location 5 minutes from Times Square and literally next to the Port Authority Terminal that allows us to come and go without major complications. actually everything perfect. Cleber Amigo and Amiga Gisella, already counting the days to return to Big Apple and of course with the decision of where to stay already taken. A strong hug."
15220,3310582,8/1/13,2585279,Joseph,"I met Gisela who was there cleaning the apartment and getting everything set while Cleber was away. The apartment was perfect! Amazing location, very comfortable bed, lots of room, and impeccably clean! Gisela was also an amazing person and even bought some coffee before she turned the apartment over. I had a great time, and I'd definitely stay there again!  "
15220,3770684,13/3/13,3430262,Jason,"Great location, Cleber is a generous host who does everything to ensure a comfortable stay. Room and bed were both spacious although kitchen and bathroom were rather small. Nevertheless I had a great time here. Once again the location is 5 minute walk from Times Square and 10 minute subway to almost anywhere in Manhattan!"
15220,3795529,16/3/13,4466522,Emily,Truly great location and extremely near Port Authority Terminal if you plan to get to and from JFK or LGA via the NYCAirporter Buses. Cleber was there at the time of check in and the room was in perfect condition and freshly cleaned. Loft bed was very comfy as long as you're nimble coming up and down. Thanks Cleber - I appreciate the coffee and chat when I first arrived!
15220,3905763,26/3/13,4763153,Jucelio,"Foram 04 dias incriveis em NY ,Cleber me deixou muito a vontade em sua casa, e ainda me deu dicas incriveis da cidade,o apartamento era muito limpo e agradavel e fica perto de tudo,muito obrigado por tudo Cléber.espero retornar em breve . abraços."
15220,4019314,3/4/13,4798230,Matt,"This is a great place to stay in the heart of NY!
It is a very safe area and a very easy to get to and from. The apartment is very neat and tidy and a perfect place to stay to experience NY living. 
Cleber was an amazing host, I didn't arrive until after midnight and he was very happy to wait up for me, and he was a very lovely guy!! Great communication leading into my booking. "
15220,4136469,13/4/13,5338603,Mathieu,"This was a great place to visit NY near times square and subway.
The apartment was really like the description and very clean.
Cleber was a great host, he helped me for some problems and I thank him very much. This was a perfect place to enjoy your stay in NYC ."
15220,4280837,24/4/13,5120790,Becky,"The area only seemed safe after getting used to it. I was approached for money twice the first day. 
If in the cold weather it's not for those who chill easily. The heater kicks on when the temp drops to 42. Wearing warm clothes was ok until the last few days.

OVERALL ... good location for the price 
"
15220,4461774,6/5/13,6087325,Mark,"This is a great place to crash that is convenient to everywhere I needed to be (Times Square, Chelsea, W Vill, etc.). As a former NYC resident I appreciated the unique set up of the apt (toilet down the hall, tiny shower, etc.), but for me it's not a problem since I'm out and about and only used the apt. as a crash pad. Cleber is a great host because he's there when he says he'll be there, greets you, gives you the lowdown....then he's gone! ha haha Only used this place because my regular place where i stay for free was not available. This is an ideal alternative I will remember for future trips (I come to NYC about once a month)."
15220,4602328,14/5/13,6088090,Julie,"Thank you Cleber. I had a great a stay at your place. It is clean, very quiet, safe and close to everything. 
The room is actually quite big and the bed is sooooo comfy :-) 
Thanks for answering my questions and helping me with the first important details.
Will definitely come back!"
15220,4742061,23/5/13,5150773,Mary,"Cleber is an amazing host. He's very helpfull, easy going and friendly. Once you need him, he'll be there for you. We got along so well, almost like we've met years ago. The apartment is very comfy, clean and location is amazing. If you're worried about the bathroom being outside the apartment, just don't. You'll get used to it. I surely didn't see any problem. As for the neighborhood, I walked at night many times and I didn't have any problems with that. There are many restaurants in this street, so it's not a desert area at night. You'll be really close to Times Square, Broadway and Port Authority Bus Station, so you can take a bus or the subway to everywhere in NY. Highly recomend Cleber as a host and his apartment for people who really wanna experience NY."
15220,4837052,28/5/13,5823244,Fellexandro,Location. Location. Location. Nuff said. Cleber was also kind enough to wait for me during check in. Had an incident at airport with baggage mismanagement. I ended up checking in 5 hours late. Thanks for that Cleber. 
15220,4900201,1/6/13,5365205,Bahti,"Cleber's apartment was a fantastic place to stay during my visit to New York. It's quiet, clean, very very conveniently located and was the perfect size for my 5 day trip. Public transportation, shops, bars and restaurants are all nearby. Cleber was friendly and helpful, always responding very quickly to my questions via email and text message."
15220,5142043,15/6/13,5127518,DavidFortescue,"Clebers apartment is amazing. It's ideally situated to get all around town (especially Times Square) and being on 9th ave its very safe. The room was the perfect size, allowing me to have a feeling of having my own space. The whole apartment and separate toilet were super clean (I witnessed Cleber giving it a spruce up after each guest left). Cleber himself was a lovely guy, willing to assist in any way. Highly recommended. "
15220,5216687,18/6/13,6663369,Nicholas,"Cleber was a great host! The Apartment is clean and quiet. Location is ideal to get anywhere in Manhattan. I will definitely be asking to stay again, or referring peeps to Cleber. This is a great deal!"
15220,5261837,21/6/13,466703,Tracey,"Had an amazing stay in NYC - great location, walking distance to everything and very clean and comfortable.  Cleber was a great host and kept in contact for check in, etc. and was very understanding when my bus was 1 1/2 hours late (thanks so much). Highly recommended!!!"
15220,5655467,10/7/13,4942092,Gabriel,"Very good location,a walk distance to everything in Mid-Manhattan, very good access to many means of transportation :
subway (Port Authority and Times Square), railway (Pen Station),
shuttles to/from airport (Port Authority),Piers 83 (Circle Cruises) and 39th street (to New Jersey,for taking beautiful photos of Mid-Manhattan).
Apartment is quiet,tidy and clean,with comfortable bed and full access to TV,fridge,bathroom and toilet.
Cleber is a very kind,discreet and helpful host,whenever necessary.
Bottom line,a highly recommended place for any tourist requiring basic conditions for visiting NYC and for recovery after long and tiring days. "
15220,5821489,18/7/13,3180278,Mario,"This has been my very first experience with AIRBnB and I'm gladly surprised. Staying at Cleber's apartment really beats all the trouble one may have with costly hotels. The apartment itself is neat and tidy besides having a comfy kitchen with all the commodities you want. Cleber is such a figure! He's a happy person who can talk a lot so that you never get bored. I do recommend AIRBnB and, when in New York, staying at Cleber's is a great option. "
15220,5943359,23/7/13,6442824,Antonio,"I had a great time staying with Cleber. He was very helpful in providing information about stuff to do in the area and the shower and room were very clean. Best of all, the AC was strong and worked very well, which was an absolute necessity given the 95+ degree temperatures in NYC at the time. As some noted, the facilities are small, but they get the job done so I can go back out and explore the city. And the price is unbeatable. Definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to explore the city (only a few blocks from Times Square)."
15220,6028741,27/7/13,7175786,Ross,"Cleber's appartment, located close to the Port Authority Terminal, Subways and Times Square was an ideal place for my stay in New York. The apartment was neat and clean and had all the amenities needed during my stay. Cleber was a charming and considerate host, answering all my emails prior to the stay promptly and providing any detail I requested. I spoke with Cleber several times during my stay and thoroughly enjoyed his company. I would recommend his accomodation to anyone travelling to New York."
15220,6151298,1/8/13,6723647,Zeljko,"Amazing host, a spacious and clean room. Cleber is such a welcoming person, a true warm-hearted Brazilian. Is also very flexible planning wise. I even added one more night there. The location of the apartment is hard to beat, close to times square and many theatres.
Will definitely first look up if Cleber's place is available the next time I come to NY."
15220,6301711,7/8/13,6771023,Kristen,"Cleber was very communicative contacting me via email and text prior to my arrival.  The location was perfect for my purpose of visiting NYC showing in the Javitts two blocks away.  The apartment was very clean, the bed comfortable and the towels soft.   Right out the front door is a mass of restaurants and eateries, and New York life.  Staying here is a no brainer for the price, location and peace of mind knowing Cleber is a good guy, apartment very acceptable and totally convenient.  Already booked for my next trip in January!"
15220,6460500,13/8/13,5943942,Heather,"Perfect location and Cleber is a perfect host!  The apartment was spotless and charming.  The bed was very comfortable, as was the whole apartment (not counting the toilet!).  Right next door to a small convenience shop and Irish pub; the location is on restaurant row.  Down the street from the Port Authority - everything you want to do in walking distance.  Cleber was very responsive to all my questions and requests.  Ladies, don't forget to pack your own hair dryer - this is important!  "
15220,6910454,30/8/13,491726,Rob,Cleber was an excellent host... Communication was spot on.  Apartment was great... perfect location... I will definitely stay here again.

15220,7597644,26/9/13,6833773,Eden,"Cleber canceled my sister's booking for his second bedroom which threw a spanner in the works for our reunion. He then offered her the couch in my room for an extra $30 a night without consultation with me. Not a great start.  Moving past that, the apartment was clean and well located."
15220,8558705,5/11/13,6784266,Sebastian,Good Location! Clean and everything OK!
15220,9535506,2/1/14,7384229,Delphine,"Great expérience! Cleber is a great host. His flat is really well located, close to Time Square. It is a very good alternative to the hotel.
I recommend the Cleber's flat extremely."

15220,11049665,18/3/14,3352395,Melinda,"Another great stay! The room was great. Bed super comfy, clean and soft sheets, great quality towel.  Drawers to use and a surprising amount of space with the lofted bed. Very clean space - amazing location just minutes from Port Authority and Times Square and TONS of great restaurants and bars near by. Small bathroom but very clean.  Bathroom down the hall is different but not an issue. For the price and convenience, can not be beat!"
15220,11261495,27/3/14,8233774,Jenny,"It was a wonderful stay at New York in Cleber's Appartment. Cleber's friend Marco made me feel very welcome and showed me everything...from the towels to the keys... It was a very clean and nice home and I had everything I needed for a perfect stay. The appartment is located near Times Square, Broadway, Penn Station and Port Authority Bus Terminal. From the PABT you can reach the Jersey Gardens Outlet Center as good as the whole city by subway. The bed was comfort and the apt was very quiet during the night. Thank you so much and I would really like to com back!
And another tipp: The Highline is a great place in New York. You can reach it easily in a 10 minute walk from the apt!!! 
 "
15220,11348339,31/3/14,3817502,Ryan,"Stayed at Cleber's apartment again for 4 days last month.  This time he was out of town, but his friend was there to meet me and check me in/out (he knew who I was when I showed up earlier than expected).  I was in the larger room with the loft bed; very neat and comfortable.  My stay was just as good as last year, and I'll come here on my visits to NYC in the future if there's room.  Thanks again, Cleber, and hope to see you next time!  "

15220,15426087,8/7/14,4952470,Maira,"The location of the apartment is perfect. It is close to the Times Square and very close to the Port Authority station. The room is very nice. Good lights, good bed, it was very clean. We had an issue with the key hole of the bathroom, but Cleber answered very promptly and helped to solve it. I recommend this apartment to anyone who wants to have access to the main points of NYC and have a confortable stay."
15220,16665902,31/7/14,14640484,Mario,It was really nice to stay at Cleber's place. The location of the apt is just perfect!

15220,19380667,11/9/14,20367712,Vanessa,"Passei 6 noites em NY juntamente com uma amiga. Fomos muito bem acolhidas pelo Cleber, local era limpo e a localização perfeita !!!! Utilizamos o apartamento praticamente para tomar banho e dormir , mas como tinha cozinha pudemos tomar café da manha de forma mais econômica e saudável. O bairro não e o mais bonito de NY, mas para quem esta indo para "" turistar"" não tem local melhor . Fica pertissimo da Times Square e a poucos metros do metro. Fizemos praticamente tudo a pé . Cleber muito obrigada !!!! Vivemos momentos inesquecíveis !!!!"
15220,20428462,29/9/14,11559511,Marlaina,We had a wonderful time in New York City! This was the perfect location to explore the city as it was close to the Port Authority Bus/Subway station (2min walk) and close to the Time Square Subway (5min walk). The apartment was clean and the perfect amount of space for the two of us. The room's window did not face the street so it was rather quiet for New York standards as we could only hear the occasional siren. The location totally makes up for having to walk down the hall to the bathroom. Thanks Regina and Cleber.
15220,20649860,3/10/14,1342012,Pierre,"Très bien reçu par Regina. Bonne situation de l'adresse,"
15220,20905754,7/10/14,9982280,Marco,"We've stayed three nights at the Apartment, overall its a nice, clean, save and cosy place. The location, just 5mins from Times Square, is fabulouse! We didn't meet our host, but Regina was really nice! We would sleep der again. "
15220,24572367,30/12/14,25212804,Paul,Cleber was amazing and allowed me early check in and was so accomodating.. I wish he had properties everywhere. I would always stay at his place. Best experience and great price.

15220,25218089,9/1/15,25005976,Avery,"My week here was really great. Cleber was awesome, and very helpful throughout the process. The location was unbelievable for the price - pretty short walk to Broadway and Times Square. I highly recommended this place!"
15220,25418517,15/1/15,24843623,Stéphanie,"Mon séjour fût des plus agréable, Cleber est très accueillant, avec de belles valeurs et m'a fait des suggestions de visites très intéressantes.  La chambre est très belle et tout est super propre! Le cartier est génial, plein de bon petits restos et vraiment prêt de Time Square, Empire States building, Lincoln Center (le New York Philharmonique en vaut vraiment la peine!), Carnegie Hall et bien plus.  Pour les autres destinations, le métro est à un coin de rue et très facile de se rendre partout.  Ce fût également un plaisir de discuter avec Walter qui louait la chambre voisine.  Je recommande sans hésiter cette chambre confortable."
15220,26297349,9/2/15,15104645,Kássia,"Nossa primeira vez em NYC, eu e meu esposo nos hospedamos na casa do Cleber, lugar singelo, ótima localização pertinho da estação de metrô da Port Authority, fomos muito bem recebidos pelo Cleber, nos deixou super a vontade. "

The only thing is the restroom is outside of apt. But it is private. Convenient location. Perfect price. Thanks so much!"
15220,27920678,15/3/15,7851367,Carmen,"Luiz,gracias por tu recibimiento.
Pero a pesar de tu maravilloso recibimiento y la situación tan buena del apartamento, hay que decir,que al menos para la gente que tenemos algunos años más, es muy incómodo. 
El wc,no es que este , fuera al fondo del pasillo, es que no se coge de pequeño. 
El baño igual . mínimo. 
Y subirse al altillo de la cama o bajarse en plena noche,tiene su miga.
Habria que arreglar,la ducha,pues andas buscando por donde saldrá el agua, para poder ducharte.
Todo esto o adecuar un poco el precio a lo que se ofrece.
De todas formas, gracias de nuevo por tu amabilidad."
15220,28160250,19/3/15,25402065,Matteo,"The apartement was awesome. The room was very large and confortable and everything was very clean. Luiz was very kind. The only problem is that the toilet is outside the apartement, so you always need to go out. It is very well connected to the rest of the city with the bus or the subway. I strongly recommend it!"
15220,28472911,24/3/15,6503154,Peter,I really recommend staying here! The Location is hard to beat and the room is clean and spaceous... Luiz was always reachable and made everything to ensure a nice stay! Anytime again!
15220,28892755,31/3/15,7616270,Mon,"Luiz's apartment is awesome! It's very clean and cozy. I felt like home! The location is very good as well. It's close to the subway, restaurants, 5minutes walk from the Time Square. Luiz is a very friendly person as well. It was very nice to meet him and have stayed in his place."
15220,29165430,5/4/15,21128842,Craig,Thanks for the perfect stay. Cleber offered excellent communication prior to arrival. The room was exactly as described. It was easy to find and really easy to negotiate my way there from JFK using the subway for just 7$. The room and apartment was very clean and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Your sheets are the comfiest I have ever slept in !!  The location is perfect for access to the whole of the city. Thanks for a great stay and I hope to come back !! I would not hesitate to recommend this apartment.  Thanks. 
15220,29842546,13/4/15,28180479,Lamon,Definitely the best location. The apartment is very clean and cozy. Luiz received me with attention and he is a great person. My first experience with airbnb was excellent.
15220,30075226,17/4/15,28424427,Carlos,"Tuve una muy buena experiencia aquí. El cuarto es amplio y todo estaba muy limpio. Al principio dudé en escoger esta opción por lo de compartir el apartamento con una persona desconocida y el toilet afuera, pero los buenos reviews y el precio me convencieron. A la final el toilet afuera no fue gran inconveniente y casi ni vi a la otra persona. Definitivamente me quedaría de nuevo aquí si tengo la oportunidad de volver a nyc. Cleber es una persona simpática y muy amable."
15220,30509656,23/4/15,28790681,Vanessa,"I already miss New York! I had a really great time and a big factor to that is Luiz's place. I've stayed there for 6 nights and I'm really glad I did. The room is clean and cozy. There is a huge amount of space to place your things. The shower is inside the apartment, however, the toilet is a few steps outside. But hey, you can't really compare that to the convenience that the place will give you. Luiz's apartment is close to a lot of must see places in NY and to the subway & bus stations too! There's a lot of restaurants and cafes nearby as well. And the most important of all, Luiz is a great host and very accommodating. I will definitely stay at this room again when I go back to New York! "
15220,30802241,27/4/15,20250157,Iris,"Very good location to travel in the city! The room is spacious, clean and surprisingly quiet in the night. Would strongly recommend to friends whoever need to travel to NYC. "
15220,31161664,3/5/15,7828038,Christophe,"A great place for a stay.Definitely.
Luiz is very welcoming.
The room is excactly as described  ( spatious , comfortable bed and very quiet ).
The flat is very clean, nice , with equipments.
The location is excellent ( very central,Times Square is close, and many subways to move everywhere through the city ). There are some shops very close to get some food,and a nice flea market on the week-ends.
I highly recommend that place for a stay in NYC"
15220,31708297,9/5/15,23442291,Melody,"I had a great stay at New York and Luiz's place! Luiz place is just awesome, which is near to time square and Broadway! I can walk back home after I watched phantom of the opera! And I love the room so much! It's spacious and its great for girl like me who had a lot of stuffs! The bed which is upstairs is super comfortable! And you have a kitchen and bedroom just next to your room. Toilet is out of the room but it's ok for me~ everything was fine and I really enjoy the stay! "
15220,32073395,13/5/15,24751134,Chris,"The trip which lived in Luiz's place is wonderful. I like the bedroom design and the bathroom is a little small but already enough for me. The best thing is the location is great and that helped me to save a lot of times. Overall, I like it. "

My stay was over a week, and it really felt like my own little apartment. I oriented very quickly and felt like a New Yorker.  Luiz is such a perfect host. Very accommodating and kind. He was there if you needed something but left you be otherwise. I will definitely stay here EVERY time I'm in nyc. 3"

The apartment is adorable, and the loft bed was so much fun!  It was so close to Times Square, but very quiet so I could get a good night's sleep.  This was my first ever trip to NYC, and this place was the perfect location.  I did not ever feel unsafe, and the apartment is secure.  I will definitely stay here again!! "
15220,51966743,25/10/15,46027917,Nicola,Was a awesome stay in the city. The location is truly amazing and very safe area. It was very clean and at a awesome price point. Was down in the city for photo expo and it was just about a 5 min walk away from the Jarvis center.

El inodoro esta fuera del apartamento en el pasillo compartido y apenas te puedes sentar, la ducha y el lavabo están dentro.
El primer dia no había agua caliente ni calefacción, al dia siguiente estaba solucionado, ok, pero cuando funcionaba la calefacción las tuberias hacían mucho ruido.
No hay armario para colgar la ropa, hay un mueble con cajones."

15220,60384387,23/1/16,11740277,Jeff,"I had a great week at Luiz's apartment. I was in town for work and it was exactly where I needed it to be (short walk to Javits) at a great price. The room was large, the apartment as a whole impeccably clean, and very comfortable. Luiz was great to deal with, very communicative and flexible. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a good deal."
15220,61414455,4/2/16,42861857,Angela,"Great stay in fantastic, central location.  Luiz was great and kept in regular contact, clear instructions made getting from the airport to and from the apartment a breeze via subway, and perfect location to base yourself for all the sights and sounds NY has to offer. The mezzanine bed meant the room was spacious with lots of room to spread out bags etc. Bathroom/shower/toilet setup is a bit unusual, but totally workable - given the price, and location, it's a small inconvenience in the scheme of things! As solo female traveller, safety & security always a consideration but happy to report no probs at all. Thanks Luiz for a great stay!"
15220,62144058,12/2/16,46898070,Liliane,"Luiz is such a great host and the room is very comfortable.  
And the location is near the metro station that u can transfer to any sightseeing  spot eazliy. 
If I visit NYC next time I'll choose to rent the room again!

15220,62807960,17/2/16,52594407,Wayne,"Luiz was a pleasure to deal with from the moment of booking all the way through to leaving the apartment. He wasn't living onsite at the time, but was there to greet me and show me all the facilities. He is very easy to contact. Sharing the apartment with another traveller is no hassle and you have great privacy. The shower and basin are inside the apartment, and the toilet is only a few steps out on the hallway and is your apartments exclusive use. Don't let this put you off, it's really fine ( and I am usually very fussy). The apartment is spotless, and the room I booked was plenty big enough for me, and my luggage and to be able to do some work the as well. It took me around 10 mins to walk to the Javits centre for a convention, and it's about the same to the middle of Time Square. There are a ton of great places to eat right on your doorstep, and I highly recommend Scallywags the Irish pub next door for a drink and to meet some awesome people. This Partmemt is such a good price  brilliant location, and for the money, hard to beat."
15220,63869694,28/2/16,44176203,Julian,"Everything was awesome! Best Location in the Heart of Manhattan, Subway, pups and Restaurants all in the neighbourhood. Perfect to Discover Manhattan and have a Break before you go on. Cozy, clean Appartement. I recommend this to everyone. If you got the chance- go and get it. I loved this neighbourhood and will definitly go back there. Luiz Is a very good Host, he's friendly and if you got a question he will do his best to answer it. Thanks for everything luiz!"
15220,65226792,12/3/16,12407628,Peng,"This room is exactly the same as described and pictured. Everything you need is provided, small but cozy and warm. The raised bed makes the room spacious. TV programs look awesome and WiFi connection is stable and fast. Bathroom is just next door, with shampoo and body wash. Although the toilet is not in the room, it is just a few meters away and private. It's not a problem at all. This location is great for people who want to explore the city in the day and night because it's quite central and has good public transport connection. There are many doors on the way to the room so I think it's very safe. Luiz is warm-hearted and always responses to your question. He is also caring the feeling of the people staying here and tries to do his best to be a great host. Thank you Luiz. I had a wonderful staying in NYC. "
15220,67130799,27/3/16,26762895,Christian,"I stayed for 2 weeks in Luiz's place and it was a great experience. The location is perfect, everything is just few blocks away and there's a lot of good options to eat in the same street. The room is spacious and since the bed is on the upper level you got plenty of space to put your stuff. The external toilet is a bit weird but you get used to it and I never met with other people in the hallway. Overall it was a good experience and Luiz was available every time I needed him."
15220,68089175,2/4/16,55687046,Hidenori,"Luiz is quick to response.
The location is super convenient. 
The room is clean and well coordinated.
I will come back again!

The bed is loft style, above the couch, and there is a large screen with movies etc...available above the bed. The toilet is outside the apt and down the hall. It was convenient and easy to stay there.mthanks Luiz and Marco!"
15220,70078100,16/4/16,50296570,Lori Lynn,"I recommend this apartment!  Great location, clean, and all the space you need for a stay in NYC for a fair low price. Hosts kept in touch with me, met me when I arrived, and even carried my heavy bag up the stairs. They alerted me that the other tenant was arriving so I would know and not be alarmed. I felt safe, and the bathroom being outside and down the hallway did not bother me at all.  I will definitely rent from Luis again! "
15220,72000943,30/4/16,29967444,Ping,"Luiz is friendly and helpful.

The bedroom is clean and cozy. Restroom and shower room are clean too, but kind of small. 

The price is good. 

The location is very convenient.  

"
15220,72788858,4/5/16,19714621,Jerry,"This was a good room at a very good location. Time Square was in walking distance and one would never get bored here. The apartment was in an old building but I got used to it very quickly. Luiz had kept the room and the toilet in super-clean condition. During my four nights here, there was no noise at all. Luiz was a very good host and answered all my questions and needs. I really would like to stay here again if I ever come back to Manhattan!"
15220,79007413,10/6/16,60440329,Ryan,"The room was exactly as described.  A great location in Hell's Kitchen.  A comfortable bed, and great kitchen facilities.  I really appreciated Luiz's care at providing a great room, meeting me and showing me the ropes.  "
15220,80505410,18/6/16,22766456,Peter,"I loved staying here and hope to stay here again. I just sent a friend a link to this page because I recommended this place to him and now he wants to stay here too. 

The location was within a 15 minute walk of every Broadway show I booked. The price is amazing (about 1/3 of what my friend paid at a hotel one block away). 

I didn't meet Luiz, but his place was clean and comfortable. I did meet Marcio who showed me around and was very helpful. I wish I had asked all my questions while Marcio was there (I had a little trouble finding towels, shampoo, where to take the trash out once I was on my own). I believe usually Luiz would be very easy to reach, but he had an illness while I was a guest so I didn't get all my questions answered as quickly as I would have if he had been well. 

Now I'll be mentioning some things that I didn't mind, but I feel if I had certain friends with me--they wouldn't have liked these elements. I thought it gave me a real experience of NYC as a local. I wasn't sheltered from the real NYC in a touristy hotel. 

1) Twice in the mornings, I had to knock on the front door of the building from the inside to get out because of inebriated gentlemen sitting on the steps. They were kind men who moved when I knocked, but I could see how some might find this disconcerting. 

2) There is construction right outside the windows of the larger bedroom ( (Website hidden by Airbnb) ). Construction is supposed to happen 8a-4p, but it started earlier while I was there. I didn't mind as I'm an early riser but some people might. 

3) The bathing room is tiny and right off the kitchen. If you're inside it with the door shut, it's a bit challenging to robe/disrobe and the water temperature wasn't consistent in the mornings (when I assume the other residents are also showering). 

AirBnB commercials aren't kidding when they say you'll live like a local. I loved it. 

If Luiz is open to it, I'd be interesting in renting both bedrooms next time. I'd have a friend stay with me and it wouldn't be as awkward to use the bathing room. I could walk from my bedroom to the bathing room in a towel or underwear and not have to change in the cramped space of the bathing room. Walking from room to room in a towel/underwear can be awkward if you don't know the person staying in the other bedroom. 

I don't find the above things negative, but I think those who might find them negative would want to know about them. 

Luiz was generous and kind when I asked to check out later. It worked out that he didn't have another renter right away. Thanks, Luiz, for making your place available. I enjoyed staying there and hope to again."
15220,89432087,28/7/16,45169883,Philipp,"Luiz is a great host, very responsive, friendly and helpful. The room and apartment is as described and the location is very good for tourists or even business travelers, as it is right in the heart of Manhattan. Definitely a recommendation!"

15220,107666725,11/10/16,18900577,Edgardo,Best location!.. In the heart of time square and Madison square garden. Room was quiet and I slept well every night. Tv has movie channels which was awesome at the end of the day while resting after a tour in the city. Wifi was available so I was able to upload NYC pics immediately thru (Hidden by Airbnb) and IG. I would definitely book to this place again when I return to NY!
15220,108546042,16/10/16,18207631,Felix,"Luiz's place was perfect for my short 2 day stay in NYC, being my first time in the city it was great to have transportation and times square in such close proximity. Everything was extremely clean and tidy, and I was always comfortable in the unit. The washroom was a little different being outside the unit but it wasn't a problem at all. I would definitely stay here again and recommend friends to stay as well."
15220,112933136,8/11/16,3498875,Katie,Great location and perfect for sightseeing on foot; I rarely got the metro in the 5 days I stayed. The room was surprisingly spacious and the bed was super comfy. Luiz was very friendly and welcomed me when I arrived.  Would highly recommend!

15220,114447210,18/11/16,98291314,Hans,"The apartment is kind of small, but it has an excellent location. In the neighborhood there are lots of bars, restaurants, stores and almost in front of the apartments there is a supermarket. 

It has a kitchen, refrigerator and microwave. All the tools for cooking, also some tools as screwdriver and a hair dryer.

It's very close from Times Square, Fifth Avenue and other touristic places such as Broadway, Central Park, Madison Square Garden, Empire State Building. You could went to this places walking from the apartment.

In the future, I will stay there again."

Neighborhood is safe and close to Broadway theaters, subway stations that can get you to anywhere in Manhattan and walking distance to Times Square.

I would recommend the place to other guests. I didn't get to meet Luiz but he was always available via Airbnb. "

Location is convinient but there is construction work right outside the room while I was here."
15220,121577128,18/12/16,63933674,Gabriel E Juliana,"The location of the apartment is really exceptional! The bedroom with the orange wall has an excellent size and a great bed. Also, it's definitely not loud, considering that you're in the middle of Manhattan.

On the other hand, I had problems with the heating's system and with the hot water (fault of the boiler of the building), which made it impossible for me to take some showers and made me feel very cold on some nights (the temperature was -15 ° C in NY and I only had 2 blankets available, so I had to sleep with my snow clothes), and with the lock of the house, which broke - because of that, I had to stay until 1 am involved in the repair, because the owner of the property was not in the city, just like the person he had indicated to be responsible. I also would say that the bathroom is uncomfortably small.

Despite this, the cost benefit pays off if you are going to spend a few nights close to everything and do not mind overcoming some uncomfortable mishaps."

His small apartment is remarkably well stocked and he has thought of all things a business traveler might need like an iron / toiletries / internet etc. The check in / ot was simple as well."

The room is a perfect size for one or two travellers, and located in a quiet building. The shower room and bathroom are very small, but worked just fine. The bed was clean and comfortable. Luiz provided a towel, extra blankets and an umbrella just in case. Overall, I would recommend this place for someone not concerned about luxury, but interested in an authentic budget stay close to lots of sights. "

15220,135583382,5/3/17,58530583,Eugene,"I visited New York to see Billy Joel in concert and needed a place to stay that wasn't too far from Madison Square Garden.  Luiz's place fit everything I was looking for.

I was to check in earlier, but there were problems with my initial flight from Chicago to New York.  I arrived later than expected, about midnight ET, and kept Luiz knowing where I was after my flight landed.  I arrived at his place at 1 AM ET, and Luiz still met me, asked how I was doing, and gave the keys.  He was nice and patient with me the entire time.

His place is as the pictures describe.  A room with a loft bed and small couch underneath it.  There are a lot of restaurants nearby, so you will not go hungry.  The subway is very close, with the 42nd Street-Port Authority station a few blocks up the road.  Times Square is nearly along with Madison Square Garden and the Empire State Building.

I would definitely stay at his place again if the opportunity presented itself."

15220,152299576,15/5/17,8774783,Isabel,"This airbnb has a very good location with many public transportation around, so you can get anywhere really quick. Bathroom was very small and a little bit smelly (no windows). The bed was very comfortable, but if you have a light sleep like I do, there are a few things you should be aware of: You can hear everything though the wall (there is another airbnb roommate in the apartment, who you share the bathroom and toilet with). The neighborhood is very busy on weekend nights, you can hear cars, music etc. There is a huge construction site right outside the room, and they start to work early in the morning on weekdays. 
Communication with Luiz was all ok, though he was not there when I checked in but his friend Carol, who was also very responsive thoughout the stay. All in all ok for a short stay. "
15220,153286704,20/5/17,30879591,Lew,The place is a much more affordable option than a hotel. The area is much more interesting than staying in midtown. It was a real comfortable & clean place to stay.

Only con: the bathroom and the toilet room (5 mt from the apartment, in the aisle) are both small, but serve their purpose."

15220,163386216,24/6/17,14683935,Emily,This place was perfect for me as I wanted to be in Manhattan for a nearby event. Luiz's place is very clean and the pictures are accurate. A small thing in the building was fixed and remedied right away when brought to Luiz's attention. I would recommend!

15220,168013726,8/7/17,35226203,Claire,It's a really nice cosy private place. I enjoyed living here.
15220,169491948,12/7/17,84601702,Natalie,A great location and price! Luiz was accommodating and the place was nice. It is an old building so the bathroom and shower are small spaces.
15220,171055240,16/7/17,61985712,Marcus,I had absolutely no problem communicating with Luiz throughout my trip in NY! He was really nice and considerate. The apartment was accurate as the online pictures show. The only problem for me is that both the bathroom and the shared toilet are pretty small.
15220,172351982,20/7/17,8713108,Illyon (Eli),I had a great stay with Luiz.  In the heart of Hell's Kitchen so it is great for walking to many of the key sites.  Great A/C and secure building.  The area is noisy but it is also the heart of NYC so it is to be expected.  Thanks Luiz
15220,174381155,25/7/17,19974547,David,Had a great time. It was as described and clean. 
15220,185780050,22/8/17,82677029,Yehonatan,"Awesome apartment in a centered location. 
Very well designed, nice and cool during humid days.
Luiz previred everything I need and was very kind and responsieve.
Thank you Luiz!"
15220,187222095,26/8/17,19337246,Heidi,"This is a nice place to sleep. The bed is really comfy, though it is loft style. Be aware that the bathroom is down the hall and you need a key (which is provided). The shower is in the apartment but is very tight and has a tiny sink. The best part about this apartment is the location. Very close to everything and the subway is just a few blocks away."
15220,188782427,30/8/17,43504940,Paulo Henrique,"Luiz is an amazing person, I had easy contact with him from check in to check out. Great location in NY, close to public transport and Time Square, I did many things only on foot due to great location. I recommend it for sure."
15220,190186640,3/9/17,110705763,Riley,Luiz was the best and allowed me to do an early check in. The apartment is in a great location close to everything.. the tiolet is out in the hall but it's not bad at all. I loved my room and experience at this location.
15220,191463029,7/9/17,23035067,Lucas,"Luiz's place is really well located and really worth it for the price you're paying. 

The room is big. It was a sofa-bed on which I was able to work. The mattress and pillows are really, really good which made me sleep really well. The internet is also good, which made my work really smooth.

Only thing that I didn't expect was that the bathroom and toilet are really small, but I ignored that because of the price I was paying.

Luis is an awesome host. He helped me check in and answered all my questions. I'm definitely staying at his place again when I come back to NYC."
15220,192031990,9/9/17,32160684,Raul,"Luiz place is exactly as described in the photos, it might be weird or uncomfortable for some the fact that the toilet is outside of the apartment and the bathroom is really small but it's totally understandable for NYC-like spaces. The place was clean and bed was very comfortable, great location. Good deal for travelers looking for a place to crash after exploring NYC."
15220,194897742,17/9/17,55878181,Agata,All good :)
15220,196549766,23/9/17,136733670,Takashi,Very kind. It is a suitable place for New York for the first time
15220,198502956,29/9/17,91573005,Jessica,"Luiz' place was super close to all the action of NYC, the place was clean, I stayed in the bunk room and it was really big and the air con was great. Awesome value for money and I'd definitely stay again!"
15220,200208258,4/10/17,151927885,Bruno,"Die  Wohnung von Luiz ist eine prima Alternative zu den teuren Hotels in der Stadt. Darüber hinaus bekommt man auch mal einen Eindruck, wie die typischen Wohnverhältnisse in New York City sind."
15220,202028936,9/10/17,43888560,Sophia,"Note: This review is for the room with the bunk-style bed.

I was pleasantly surprised by how wonderful my stay here at Luiz's place was. The room is a standard small room for NY but it felt so much bigger because the bed was not in the way. Since it is raised above, there was more space to maneuver and relax! I loved this feature the most because I could set up my laptop station at the sofa area under the bed which had a height clearance of probably 6' (maybe less)? I'm 5'3"" so I was able to walk under the bunk area just fine.

Getting to the bed area was fine for me, but you will have to be very careful in watching where you step. There's not much to hold on to except for the railing of the bunk ladder and the side of the bed. Once there though, it is fantastic. The mattress was soft yet firm enough to offer plenty of back support. The sheets were soft and clean. There's a lamp next to the mattress for added light in the dark. Then the best part is the tv that is stationed right in front of you with so many channels to choose from a Roku system that is connected to the apartment's Netflix account (and a few others too).

Your sleep will be sound here! Of all the nights I stayed here in this room, I barely heard any outside noise! Usually the nightlife of NY is loud, especially in the bustling streets of Times Square! So I was rather surprised how quiet it was here despite the fantastic location. I think it was that the room's window was turned away from the streets, and the room is on the second floor of the building.

For those who make bathroom visits in the middle of the night, it may be a bit inconvenient as the toilet is actually outside the apartment in the hallway behind a locked door. So you'll have to climb down the bunkbed, remember to grab the keys, put shoes on, go out of the apartment and down the hall, and unlock the door to the toilet room. This didn't bother me much though, considering how lovely the rest of the stay is.

Right outside the apartment are so many convenient shops and lots of restaurants to choose from. I defaulted to the korean fried chicken joint during nights when I was too lazy to go on food adventures after a long day out. A couple blocks from Port Authority, this place was so easy to find when coming in from the airport. The reason of my stay here was for a convention at Javits so this place was the perfect location as it was a mere few blocks away from the convention center as well.

I definitely recommend staying here if you can. The stay was great and Luiz is a very kind, gracious host."
15220,204131845,16/10/17,26775974,Tiago,"The best location and great host! You are 10min (aprox) walking distance from Times Square, and close to many of NY main attractions. A couple of things: The bed was on top of a small set of stairs, so it might not be very accessible for some people. The toilet is outside of the apartment and very small (the shower is inside the apartment though). If you are ok with these two things, then you'll have a great time. 

Everything else was as described so I would definitely recommend it."
15220,206298083,24/10/17,125452498,Silvia,Luiz was a great host! The only thing that kept me from giving the fifth star was the bathroom being in the hallway and the shower being a little bit small. All in all it was a great experience!
15220,207710663,29/10/17,150857108,Danielle,"This was a great location, only 6 minute walk from Port Authority/Subway, with some nice dining options within a block or two. The apartment was small but very clean with super soft sheets and a very comfortable bed. The bathroom in the hall (outside of the apartment) wasn't ideal but it worked out. My only complaint was the construction going on at daylight on Saturday right next door. If you are an early riser, not a problem but if you like sleeping in, it's hard to do when the jack hammers get going. There were no workers on Sunday so it was quiet. Overall, I would stay again."
15220,212177148,16/11/17,104034514,景红,"It was a great experience. The place was clean and bed was very comfortable. And great location, close to Time Square and all of Midtown. I did many things only on foot. I would like stay again."
15220,213331456,20/11/17,53395687,Charlotte,"Absolutely fabulous, very close to time sq and theatre district, easy to find, and easy to navigate away from here. A perfect host with great communication, very accommodating when my flight was delayed and I had to miss a night. Would stay here again in a heartbeat."
15220,214304047,25/11/17,154658033,Ayumi,"1人で泊まれるのかと思っていたら寝室が2つあり、他の人とリビング・バスルーム・トイレが共通でした。(部屋説明の訳し方をこちらが間違ってしまったようです。)
写真に出ている部屋は広くて快適でしたが、チェックインの際にもう1つの、写真に載ってない狭い寝室を指示されたのが少し気になりました。(交渉の結果広い部屋を使えるようになりましたが…。)"
15220,217307570,8/12/17,122489936,Jane,"Absolute perfect location, minutes away from fabulous restaurants, Times Square and central for getting around. I was nervous about sharing with a stranger - however having bedroom locks was added security. The loft bed was so comfortable, linen beautifully laundered including the towel. Spotlessly clean and suprisingly large space in the room. 
I felt like I was constantly asking Luiz questions however he promptly replied patiently to each. Would highly recommend staying here and a bargain for the price and location."
15220,218732252,14/12/17,10376102,Victoria,"Luiz place is always amazing.  I always feel right at home.   It has everything you need.  So close to everything, trains, bus's and on the doorstep of Times Square!   My second time in NY and both at Luiz.   I would stay there again in a heart beat !!   Thanks Luiz !!"
15220,219107988,16/12/17,68915075,Nigel,"This place was perfect. Close to the subway, Hell’s Kitchen, Time Square. I had a great time. Would highly recommend it and would definitely book again"

The apartment is kind of small with toilet in the hallway, but it's so convenient to go everywhere and hangout late!
Great experience!"

15220,226582243,11/1/18,51417668,Bente,Really good location close to time square. The neighbourhood felt safe. There was some noise from construction work outside my bedroom window but it didn’t bother me much. The room was big and spacious and the bed was comfortable. Over all a pretty good place to stay. And Luiz was a very nice host :)
15220,227637677,15/1/18,40057339,Andre,Good place to stay on a budget
15220,231480207,1/2/18,36811170,Brooke,Loved the location of this apartment! Super close to Times Square and the subway lines. The pizza place two blocks up was amazing and really cheap!
15220,232342964,4/2/18,65782991,Ashish,"Location is central to the city and near to night life. If you are planning to spend most of the time in midtown, this is a great place to stay. I found it slightly pricey (but it may be midtown standard). Bathroom is very small in size and to access the toilet you need to go to hallway (outside apartment). The toilet is also very small and you need to unlock and lock it back when you use it. It is unconvineint but not a deal breaker."
15220,233036146,7/2/18,128247313,Rakshit,"Luis’s place was perfectly located, clean, well maintained and overall a perfect place for a couple of days’ stay. Highly recommended!"
15220,233445084,9/2/18,3586272,Laura,Luiz and his place are great. Would always come back :)
15220,234048953,11/2/18,61093387,Josh,This was my second stay at Luiz’s place. It was a clean and quiet room and a good bet for an authentic apartment close to Times Square.
15220,239171321,28/2/18,17243791,Sheyla,"Although I didn't meet Luiz, I met his friend Tony who was helpful and available via text should I have any queries or concerns. As some other reviewers mentioned, neither Luiz nor Tony stay at the apartment, only the guests do.
The room is pretty spacious and clean, and they also provided towels for my stay, which I think was a nice touch. The kitchen is a decent size and clean, plus having access to its amenities makes any trip cheaper.
The bathroom is really small and the water pressure for the shower is a bit low, so if you have long hair like me you might be in there for a while. Also pointed out in the room posting is the fact that the toilet is outside the apartment, which can be inconvenient. But it was clean, although a bit cramped.
The location of the apartment is very good and I was able to walk pretty much anywhere in Midtown or just get the Subway two blocks away.
If you're travelling by yourself and don't mind the toilet issue, I'd say this place is ideal. I'd stay there again if ever back in NYC."
15220,242335971,11/3/18,44302407,Katherine,"Luiz's place is fantastic! Great location, terrific hospitality and most important for me, a really comfortable, quiet place in the middle of everything in NYC.  I'm a fussy sleeper and was really impressed with how comfortable the bedding in the sleep loft is.  I'll definitely stay here again!"
15220,243327725,15/3/18,61773199,Kizher Buhary,"Place is just as advertized. Central location, close to Penn Station and Times Square. Cozy and comfortable. Plenty of restaurants and shops close by. Would stay here again."
15220,247171482,27/3/18,33742380,Adrian,La ubicación es muy buena para llegar a cualquier atracción en NYC en metro. Lo único es que compartes cocina y baño. Buena relación costó beneficio
15220,254899697,18/4/18,97959473,Ray,"I can't believe the morons who have made negative posts. Luiz has been very clear in his description of what the apartment is like.  READ CAREFULLY. I needed a shower, a bed, Wi-Fi and a room to safely spread out my stuff.  That's what he described and that is EXACTLY what I found when I got there.  If you assumed certain ""services"" would be available, but failed to verify ahead of time, that is YOUR failure, not the hosts. Luiz exemplifies the best qualities in a host and I highly recommend contacting him if you are going to visit Times Square and Hell's Kitchen."
15220,256361424,22/4/18,174643265,Christopher,very good location for being close to New York attractions and transport. Luiz will respond and be very accomodating in ensuring your stay is a comfortable one.
15220,259774618,2/5/18,152686839,Kris,Great location in heart of the kitchen
15220,261525146,6/5/18,66262078,Heather,"This place is an awesome value in a great location, but make sure to read the description! The layout is a little odd, with the toilet not in the actual apartment, and the room with the shower and sink is really small. I had some issues with the wifi being a little in-and-out - not sure if this is typical. The window unit A/C was greatly appreciated, and the lofted bed results in a really nice sitting area. Luiz is great and really flexible with check-in and check-out. Everything was nice and clean. If you're looking for an inexpensive place to stay really close to Times Square, this is a wonderful option."
15220,270590970,29/5/18,160589321,Jade,"The apartment have a very good location, close to time square, many subway around, restaurants everywhere. Excellent for a first time in New-York if you want to see Manhattan and principals tourist attractions.
But, there is a building construction just in front of the bedroom's windows, so there is a lot of noise early in the morning. It's not a problem if you wake (Email hidden by Airbnb) but if you want to sleep, you can't.
There are many homeless in front of the building, but never had a problem with them. Quite and clean place, I had 2 different roommates and there were quite and polite.
Tony made my check-in and he was very patient cause my shuttle took 2 hours to get me to the apartment (take the subway).
Luiz was very king and accepted at the last minute that a friend can stay with me for few nights. But I don't recommended this place for two peoples. The bed is too small for two and the couch is too hard. But we were in New-York so we dealed with it ! :)

L'appartement est parfaitement situé, proche de Time Square, plusieurs métro aux alentours, des restaurants partout. Parfait pour une première expérience à New-York si vous souhaitez visiter Manhattan et ses principales attractions touristiques.
Par contre il y a un immeuble en construction juste en face des fenêtres de la chambre donc beaucoup de bruit tôt le matin. Ce n'est pas un problème si vous vous levez à 7h mais si vous souhaitez dormir, c'est impossible.
Beaucoup de sans abris devant l'entrée de l'immeuble mais je n'ai jamais eu de soucis avec. L'endroit est calme et propre, j'ai eu 2 colocataires différents qui était discrets et polis.
Tony a fait mon check-in et il a été très patient car ma navette a mis 2h pour me déposer (prenez le métro).
Luiz a gentillement accepté à la dernière minute qu'une amie se joigne à moi pendant quelques nuits. Mais je ne recommande pas cette chambre pour deux, le lit est trop petit pour y tenir à 2 et le canapé beaucoup trop dur. Mais nous étions à New-York alors on a fait avec ! :)"
15220,271857992,2/6/18,69477446,Tobias,"I really enjoyed staying at Luiz' apartment! The best thing about it is definitely the location in the center of manhatten. Also, it is very clean and the check-in and check-out was very easy! The apartment consists of two bedrooms which are rented separately, means you share the living room and bathroom with another person. But that's totally okay because if you don't want to meet the other person you can stay in your bedroom which is big enough. The only negative point is that the bathroom is very small but it's okay."
15220,272972703,4/6/18,150027707,Kiersten,"Really enjoyed my stay here! The location was perfect. It was only a 10-15 minute walk away from all the places I wanted to go. There are plenty of food options and things to do nearby. The apartment is small, but cozy and surprisingly quiet. I felt very safe there. Luiz and Tony were very responsive when I contacted them beforehand. They were even nice enough to let me check in early on the day of my arrival. I would definitely stay here again."
15220,275160393,10/6/18,16729785,Michelle,"The room is one of two in a second floor apartment, located 2 minutes walk away from Port Authority bus station and 5-10 minutes from the theatre district. Despite its central location, the place is generally quiet and the other guest was barely noticeable. The bedroom itself was spacious thanks to the loft layout, and the bed and sheets were amazingly comfortable! The entire place is extremely clean and tidy and the hosts are very hospitable and responsive."
15220,277064584,15/6/18,62327826,Gene,"The place is strategically located in Manhattan and is easily a great choice to those who prefer to be close to where the hustle and bustle are in the city. Tony, who helps familiarise occupants to the place, is very helpful and responsive through SMS to my queries.

It is advisable that occupants keep the shower room unlocked to avoid accidental lock outs. Keep your keys with you all the time."
15220,279755071,21/6/18,44255861,Jane,"Amazing value since accommodation in NYC is ridiculously expensive. The place is very close to Times Square and the theatre district. Room was large and clean. It did get really hot up on the loft bed even with the a/c on since hot air goes up, room probably could do with a ceiling fan. Shower water pressure was a bit bad and I sometimes couldn’t get hot water running so had to take a cold shower. Toilet being outside is a bit of a pain but it all worked fine. All in all, this is a good place to stay, being in manhattan and not going to break your bank."

15220,305035943,10/8/18,53738372,Sam,"Luiz is a really good guy and he makes a hell of a cup of coffee if you're fortunate enough to have him there while you are. This place is quite small, a bit smaller than the photos show, but it is certainly what affordable NYC looks like. Especially the toilet room (outside the apartment) is no larger than an airplane lavatory, and it is very tricky to stand square at the sink in the shower room without one foot in the shower. Most everything was very clean, but I did find a bug on the wall one night. I had the privilege of sleeping in both rooms of the apartment. The room with the loft is larger, but be wary of the loft temperature - it was a hot summer week when I was there and the loft area was around 20 degrees warmer than the floor with AC on full, which for me was extremely uncomfortable, especially because memory foam absorbs heat. I had to convert the couch into a bed and sleep on that the first night. The loft is also pretty unforgiving - rough wood and visible screws at the corners - so make sure you can always see where you're going. The other room had a larger bed, but as a 6'1'' man, I couldn't lay all the way flat even diagonally without my feet up against the wall. Both mattresses are very comfortable and the sheets were very clean. Luiz's friend Tony was a gem when helping with check-in. Overall, this is a pretty darn good way for a young solo traveler to learn what living in Midtown would really look like for them, and I'm glad to have had the experience, especially because it was less than half the expense of nearby hotels. "
15220,314966329,27/8/18,4278771,Tristan,"Great spot! Right by Midtown, with easy access to the Upper West Side, Downtown, and even a short-ish walk to Grand Central. The place is very quiet, only on my last day did I see another person in the hallway, and someone in the other attached AirBNB property. A welcome relief from the hustle and bustle out on the streets :)"

15338,25173,31/1/10,70495,Andreas,Everything worked out perfectly! Andrea is a very nice guy and a great host. The room is simple but very convenient and a real bargain for this price!
15338,49022,1/6/10,131945,Justin,"Andrea! Awesome place! Totally loved it. Gorgeous living space, not too far from anything. But not too close, either, if that makes sense. A great rooftop to sit on, and a ton of space to hang out in or play piano or pass out at eight am in or whatever you're into. The other travelers staying in the house were lovely. Andrea--also great. Met me at the train station and showed me around. Didn't see him again after that. I would stay there again for sure. In a second. Good times, all around."
15338,79668,16/8/10,186387,Tamasin,"This place is laid back, you can feel free to do what you want.
It has good cooking facilities.
Also great to have a piano and a good sound system.
Nice to go on the roof top and overlook the highway and city.
Ten times better than staying in a hostel and has a unique bohemian vibe.
Close to eating places and bars in the neighbourhood.

Issues for me personally were with noise (from the freeway being your direct neighbour) and a not so clean bathroom.
Also he needed to change the photo and description of the place, as he had said it was quiet and there is a washing machine but it was for the room across the hall not the one I stayed in. So was disappointed about that.

However, overall I enjoyed  staying here and Andrea is very honest and trustworthy.

Highly recommended, once he changes his description and photos to be more accurate."

15338,150389,7/12/10,290062,Duane,The place was awesome! Good location and transit is easily accessible. Andrea was a very hospitable host and very helpful! I would definitely stay here again.

15338,175633,28/1/11,155689,Joab,Cool room in an expansive hip Brooklyn apartment--and the price can't be beat. Andrea is a thoughtful host too. ...

15338,196650,11/3/11,155689,Joab,It's the Rock n Roll Hotel for Brooklyn!

15338,252414,5/5/11,155689,Joab,"You can see Manhattan from the rooftop! The collection of reading material is pretty terrific, should you be too knackered to venture out. Convenient and clean and well-suited for the budget-minded traveler. "
15338,253447,6/5/11,155689,Joab,Cool roof
15338,255850,8/5/11,25255,Quentin,"Andrea was super! even lets us change our travel plans at the last minute and was able to accomodate us a day early... Nice spot in the BK! Thx again Andrea :)!
"
15338,260810,12/5/11,155689,Joab,"Brooklyn's unofficial rock n roll hotel....great view from the roof, funky neighborhood nearby and a pleasant 10 minute walk to the subway..."
15338,265266,16/5/11,448706,Victoria,"Andrea is a really nice guy - his place is exactly as described. Its definitely not one for the clean freaks but great for an authentic feel of Brooklyn life. Its in a convenient location too, really near the bars and buzz of Williamsburg. Only annoyance we had was that there were 7 other guys staying in the place as well as us, and from the description we thought there would have only been a max of 6 across the 3 rooms. This meant that all the rooms were slept in as well as people sleeping on the couch, chair and floor in the lounge! Perhaps worth asking who else is booked in when you contact :)"
15338,283153,27/5/11,446365,Laure,"Andrea was nice! Good location, easily accessible... Good times!"
15338,287586,30/5/11,341087,David,"It was a great stay, loved brooklyn!"
15338,311639,13/6/11,213143,Marie-Christine,Andrea is a great host his place is really well located and there is everything one needs when visiting Brooklyn. We had a great experience  I recommand the place.
15338,315467,14/6/11,568838,Tatiana,The host canceled my reservation 17 days before arrival for a good reason and helped me on finding a new place. I hope to stay at his place next time!
15338,326613,21/6/11,579311,Don,Very cool apartment and only about 20 mins walk to some of the best parts of Brooklyn. Andrea was a great host and I'd thoroughly recommend staying here.
15338,336691,27/6/11,341087,David,Great place to stay especially if you are into playing/listening to music.  Great host.  Thank you.
15338,339360,28/6/11,598493,Marie-Eve,The host canceled my reservation 6 days before arrival.
15338,373040,14/7/11,769802,Lauren,Andrea was a great host! Fabulous taste in music too. Highly recommended!
15338,397460,25/7/11,655717,Sarah,The host canceled my reservation 4 days before arrival.
15338,402000,28/7/11,590067,Reto,"The loft itself, as a room, with its big open space and the piano is great and the neighborhood of Greenpoint is pleasant and interesting. Andrea was always available when we needed him and he gave us excellent recommendations on where to eat out. However, and despite the fact that it's inexpensive for New York, it was a pity that the loft was so messy and dirty. Also, the traffic is very loud (our bed trembled when towing trucks were on the ramp) and you shouldn't  mind other guests possibly sleeping in the living room if you decide to stay here. "
15338,504060,5/9/11,341087,David,"good times, fun funky place, flexible host, worth the $"
15338,513451,8/9/11,922476,Debbie,"In 2011, two friends of mine and me stayed in Andreas apartment in Brooklyn. It was an awesome experience. Andrea lives in a very unique building, in Williamsburg. We had a great time, jamming together and going out in the vibrant neighborhood. The rooms are very basic, but nice. If you want to have a fun and unique stay during your trip to NY, this is the place to be. Thank you Andrea!"
15338,567000,25/9/11,1146791,John,I stayed in Andrea's place for 5 days after relocating to NYC. Andrea is a really nice and friendly guy and made me feel welcome. It's about 15 mins walk to the L or G trains to get you round Brooklyn or into Manhattan. It's a cool pad - It's not the Hilton but it has everything you need and it's good value. It sure beats staying in a hostel.
15338,634114,16/10/11,1252177,Bianca,"Andrea was the perfect host and made me feel totally at home. He knows how to be friendly and helpful, at the same time maintain a distance that gives his guests a sense of privacy. Andrea's loft is amazing!! If you're into trashy horror movies and mind-blowing music choose this spot. Its located only a short distance from Williamsburg, very easy to get there by bike. Andrea was there to meet me when I arrived and gave great suggestions about the area. We had an amazing time exploring the restaurants, bars, and shops! The noise didn't bother me much. If you've ever lived in a urban spot, you know what to expect!  I really did not want to leave! BIG UP! 3
"
15338,878531,23/1/12,341087,David,"Great spot for a short stay in New York.  Neat, clean, Andrea's got everything covered."
15338,1094618,7/4/12,1983759,Anne,"Andrea is a really nice guy. He is fun and we went out for a beer and a game of pool one night - great! He was helpful with advises about the neighborhood. Though we had a great time at Andreas, the apartment needs a thorough cleaning.   "
15338,1216230,2/5/12,1894427,Nicolas,"Andrea is a really great host ! I stayed during 2 weeks , and this huge living room was really a good place to chill sometimes.I really recommended it ."
15338,1336003,23/5/12,2192788,James,"it  was great to be back after 25 yrs,,to see what has and has not changed. Williamsburg has definitively changed, don't particularly like the look of the new condos. All in all NY is young, alive and looking good!"
15338,1365633,28/5/12,1765101,Benoit Et Céline,"Andrea is a very friendly guy and we had a good time with him, drinking some beers... BUT :

But the place is really dirty. We planned to stay 2 nights but we left on the 1st day because of that. Bedlinens smelt bad and the litter in the bathroom  was full of sanitary pads... The price he asks to pay is really expensive for that experience. I really regret to have booked there. We had to pay for an hotel on the day after...."
15338,1407180,3/6/12,2295595,Sheel,"For my first AirBnB experience, I stayed at Andrea's place in Greenpoint for six days. Although I never had a chance to meet him, I found Andrea to be a communicative, very helpful, and friendly host -- he rapidly answered any and all questions I had and helped me get basically situated with the area. 

Some caveats: The street this particular place is located on is somewhat desolate/warehouse-ey, and I was initially concerned about that. It ultimately felt quite safe and is just a block away from normal residential streets. I also rather enjoyed walking through this part-Polish, part-hipster, all-relaxed corner of Brooklyn (it's about a 20 minute walk to the nearest subway). Also, to echo what some other people have said, the living area is a little cluttered and not the cleanest. The bedroom was fine (with fresh sheets and towels, and air conditioning!), though a little smaller than it looks.

Thanks, Andrea!"
15338,1466436,12/6/12,1847049,Lloyd,"I didn't meet Andrea but he was super helpful with directions and details. The place was in a great location, near general stores and only a 10 minute skate to Bedford St. Would defiantly stay there again!"
15338,1920289,7/8/12,3075375,Jordi,"The place is a kind of audio studio with rooms close to the hipsters districts of greenpoint and williamsburg. Having air conditionning was really a important point during summer. I was glad to relax reading a comic in the comfy sofa a rainy day. Even if I didn't met Andrea it was fun to meet other guests in the place. Andrea was very helpful providing the key and gave me interesting tips and clear information and kept me informed by text messages.
On the other hand the place was a bit far from the subway and it took quite a long time to get to Manhathan. Sheets were washed but a part from the mess, that doesn't bother me, the room was dusty and the toillets kind of dirty which really annoys me. I don't expect a daily clean up but at least a weekly, when you have guests... So I reccomend the place if you are really looking for a cheap place near the hipster districts and not that far from Manhattan, and you are not really strict with cleanning or you bring your shower sandals and do a bit of cleaning in your room."
15338,2147584,30/8/12,3368890,Sean,I had an emergency after making reservations with Andrea and was unable to stay at his place. He was very flexible and understanding about the problem. Thank you!
15338,2262230,11/9/12,3042433,Benedikt,"hi,
me and my brother had a nice stay in brooklyn. although the apartment is not the cleanest one we enjoyed it very much. the subway is not far away and if you don't want to walk you can go by bus.
andrea was very nice and gave us some useful tips. 
during our stay, there were various other people staying in the same apartment. but it was no problem at all, they were really nice and we had some great talks.
thank you!"
15338,2519156,6/10/12,3061700,Rhys,"Stayed here with 3 others for 3 1/2 weeks. Had a great time, made good use of the stereo and Andrea's vinyl collection!"
15338,2607098,14/10/12,3675664,Dave,"Great place to stay if youre just looking for a super cheap place thats conveniently located. You can walk out the door and be in Manhattan in around 30 minutes. Lots of great delis/bakeries nearby on Nassau and Metropolitan and it's only about a 20-30 minute walk to Williamsburg. Also, Andrea is a great host...he was super friendly and accomodating when I got in (he let me borrow his laptop when mine crapped out) and he's even gonna mail me my cell phone (because I'm an idiot and I left it in my room). "
15338,2724928,26/10/12,3838854,Colin,"Andrea is a very experienced host and extremely nice and helpful. His place is enormous, and he lets one make liberal use of his entertainment system. For the price, in NYC, you can't do much better. The downsides are all things he states up front: collegiate level of cleanliness, and surging traffic from the expressway (which is fairly well remedied with application of earplugs). Andrea helped me with all my questions and ultimately recommended a car service for the airport that arrived faster than it took me to exit the building. I'd be happy to stay in his place again. "
15338,2739459,28/10/12,3804982,Sara,"Andrea is an excellent host. The place is spacious and artsy.  The vibe is very much a ""bachelor pad""--it's fine for the average joe looking for an affordable, warm, convenient place to crash. I would not recommend it for neat-freaks or germaphobes--the bathrooms & kitchen are in need of a deep clean and major decluttering. The shower is across the hall. The room itself was fine, basically a mattress and pillows, which does the trick. Wifi worked great. Good location, but next to very busy streets, so probably not ideal for people traveling with children. Overall, it's good accommodations for the price. "
15338,2793279,3/11/12,3814101,Ilan,"Andrea is a great host, he went through quite a bit of trouble to make sure I got the key alright and settled in ok. 
Nevertheless, the rooms are tiny and the flat would need a proper clean up, in my opinion
Apart from the fact that you'll sleep 20 meters away from a highway, that the bedroom door doesn't close and that it smells a bit like wet cigarettes, the value for money is hard to beat to stay that close to Williamsburg.
"
15338,2927394,20/11/12,3745467,Marc,"Before i got here, the only thing i was worried about was the shower and the type of neighborhood the place is in. Andreas place exceeded all of my expectations. Its a beautiful place located really nicely in brooklyn, a short walk from most places. andrea is a really nice guy too! I would not hesitate in staying here again or recommending this place to a friend. Also, the shower is just a shower! Theres nothing wrong with the shower, and im a classy, classy guy!"
15338,3114295,18/12/12,4283136,Rajaditya,"This review will be a cliche in the fact that it echoes the same sentiment as all the previous reviews. Andrea's space is a nice place to stay in NY. While some may gripe about the walk from the nearest metro to this place, I think its fine. So go ahead and book this one for your next stay. I know I will. 

P.S : Make sure you inform Andrea about the time when you will be reaching the place approximately. I didn't and I had to stand infront of the house for quite a while as the buzzer was malfunctioning. 
 "
15338,3312585,8/1/13,1730791,Sara (Tia),"Andrea's place seemed scary at first (the location is empty at night as the entire street is warehouses), and the building seemed abandoned, but eventually, we had a nice stay, also thanks to the fact that we were the only guests there those days! Andrea was kind enough to accept three of us and our puppy for 2 nights. The bathroom, like the others say, is not very clean, and definitely Andrea could improve the bathroom cleanness by scrubbing, and using better products, but it served its purpose of a quick shower. The big hang out space is comfortable for chill, sociable people, and Andrea offers many good movies/CDs/records for entertainment. I'm not sure how my experience would have been had there been other guests in the apartment, but for what it was, it was a nice stay, quite chill, relaxing. I did not take the train so I cannot comment on that, but it was only 4 miles to Manhattan (by car), which was convenient. All in all, it was a cool stay, and this place is for cool, easygoing, chill people who do not mind some dirt in the bathroom, and basic sleeping needs. If you are a neat freak, and expect a real bed, or a super clean living area, then this is not for you, but if you are rock-n-roll type of person, then this is great chill place!"
15338,3376483,20/1/13,1433256,Soyoung,This place has a big public space. It's easy to hang out with people of other rooms. I met nice people there and was very comfortable the whole time.
15338,3459884,2/2/13,4669865,Zack,Andrea's place was great and just what I was looking for. A cozy bed to sleep and good wifi while I explored the city in the day. I spent a few days in my room studying which it was also ideal for. Thanks much!
15338,3546908,15/2/13,370518,Brent,"Great place to stay! 

Pros:
- Affordable
- Lots of space
- awesome area (one stop beer shop!)
- flexible host

Cons:
- cluttered / somewhat dirty
- noise from highway (you get used to it though)

I would stay here again."
15338,3760827,12/3/13,4603148,Marcus,Totally awesome. Andreas was helpful and nice. Made friends with the other guests and loved the atmosphere of the place. Will definitely stay again
15338,3997259,2/4/13,4802421,Florian,"Andrea has an awesome apartment! He is very nice and helpful if you have any questions/problems. The area is cool, too, seemed very safe to us and there is a bus stop just 1 minute away, which takes you directly to the subway (without the bus, it's about 15 minutes walking). The shower is not the cleanest shower you have seen before, but it's alright. You have an awesome view from the roof! We also had very nice roommates, and if we ever come back to New York / Brooklyn we will definitely consider staying here!"
15338,4064571,7/4/13,5237694,Sebastian,"I rent this room for 2 of my friends and they have a great experience. 
Andreas is so helpful guy and attentive .
I recommend this room for anyone that want came to NYC to have fun."
15338,4119154,11/4/13,4945899,Randi,"We stayed at Andrea's place for four days. Andrea was really nice and welcoming. He showed us around and gave us restaurant recommendations on the first night. He had also prepared a (Hidden by Airbnb) map with shops and restaurants in the area. 

The apartment is spacious and there are lots of things to keep you entertained (Netflix, N64, music, DVDs, books...), it looks just like on the photos Andrea provides on the website. As noted in previous reviews, the bathroom is not particularly clean but we didn't mind too much. 

The area is nice, many places to eat and buy groceries, 15 minutes to the G or L metro. 

We had a good time, would stay there again!"
15338,4210805,19/4/13,4580693,Francois,"excepté la photo d'Andrea sur le site, nous ne savons pas à quoi il ressemble ! il ne nous a ni accueilli ni dit au revoir ! son appartement est un SQUAT !!! il n'a pas dû faire le ménage depuis le siècle dernier ! rien n'est rangé, la cuisine est insalubre, le frigo immonde ! la douche est le summum, c'est absolument DEGUEULASSE !!!!!! à part un groupe punk, je ne vois pas qui pourrait y trouver son compte. autant dire que je ne recommande cet appartement à personne. fuyez, fuyez, fuyez !!!!!"
15338,4273112,23/4/13,2905154,Andrew,Great place. Really enjoyed the welcome. Definitely recommend to others. Fun experience! 
15338,4343686,29/4/13,5725672,Ermenegildo,"My experience in this loft is totally negative. The loft itself is a deposit of old electronic devices. Everything is dusty and dirty. The kitchen is full of bottles with remains inside. The room is dirty and very noisy as it is very close to a highway. It is impossible to sleep. The door cannot be closed, because the lock is broken. I had to take my laptop with me because I couldn't leave it there. Shower and bathroom are old and musty. I saw the tenant only once, when I handed over the keys, then never again. I strongly discourage everybody from this apartment.

Meine Erfahrung in dieser Loft war sehr schlecht. Sie ist ein Abstellplatz für alte Elektronik. Die eingebaute Küche ist mit herumstehenden Flaschen zugemüllt. Das Zimmer ist schmutzig und sehr laut (man sieht auf eine sehr nahe Highway hinüber), das Bett ist unbequem. Man kann die Tür gar nicht zuschließen. Ich musste mein Laptop immer mitnehmen, weil ich es dort nicht lassen konnte. Die Dusche ist alt und schmutzig. Ich habe den Vermieter einmal gesehen, als er mir den Schlüssel aushändigte, dann nie mehr. Ich kann es niemandem empfehlen.

La mia esperienza in questo Loft è molto negativa. Il loft stesso è un deposito di vecchi pezzi di elettronica. Tutto è impolverato e sporco. La cucina è piena di bottiglie con resti dentro. La camera è molto sporca e molto rumorosa in quanto dà su una highway. È impossibile dormire. La porta non si può chiudere, perché la serratura è scassata. Ho dovuto portarmi dietro il laptop tutto il tempo, perché là non potevo lasciarlo. La doccia e il bagno sono di una sporcizia unica. L'affittuario l'ho visto una sola volta, quando mi ha consegnato le chiavi, poi mai più. Sconsiglio vivamente questo appartamento."
15338,4521156,10/5/13,5984800,Ronan,"This place is pretty much ok if you're a back packer and not used to stays in 5 stars hostel. It's nice to meet your roommates in the living room. Rooms are small, but it's not ment to fit a family trip. The shower definitely needs a cleaning but i've seen worst. It worth what it cost. andrea is a nice guy who is helpful when you're in needs. "
15338,4648655,18/5/13,4096411,Ned,"Andrea is nice and is keen to make sure you are comfortable. The apartment and room itself were a little cluttered and untidy. The rooms do not have keys and as the apartment is shared with other guests I would have appreciated the option to lock my door. Also if it is possible request the room away from the highway, although I am not a light sleeper the noise was quite considerable at times."
15338,4965731,4/6/13,529059,Narvaez,"location is good, nice area, with an excelent view of the rooftop; but the apartments is messy and dirty, the shower is small and dirty, we had to clean the restroom because one of others guest left it impossible and Andrea said he couldnt clean it until next day. 

   The rug of my bed was dirty with a lot of hair, I preffered not to use the pillows... is not easy to access the bed (in a mezzanine) from the wood stairs, you have to be vary careful. 

 "
15338,5013400,7/6/13,6219481,Letty,"For the price and location of this place, it was so worth it. Upon checking in we met Andrea, who by far was one of the best hosts we had during our stay in NYC. Besides sharing some yummy brews on the rooftop, he made us feel very at home as we played records during the day and recommended some awesome places to check out at night. 

The place is lofted with each room separated for privacy and although cluttered the space was very very cool. We stayed there when there were other guests as well so it was nice meeting some new faces. The location was 15min walking distance from Williamsburg, which has tons of bars and food places but there are a few places down the street to check out as well and a very convenient little market. I would definitely recommend this place for future guests! "
15338,6767252,24/8/13,6650222,Zoe,"Hey! The place is ok for the price. The kitchen and living room are nice. Andrea is a really nice guy altough we didn't see him very often. 
The bathroom was quite dirty but it didn't bother us a lot. We weren't at home much. 
The rooms are ok but right next to a huge Highway so there is a loooot of noice. The bed was vibrating from time to time because of the big trucks on the Highway. 
The Subway is the one that bring's you right into Manhattan. You have to walk about 10-15 min to get to the station. All in all we liked the neighbourhood. It Is close to cool places in Brooklyn williamsburgh."
15338,8155719,18/10/13,9060988,Ludovic,"Great dude, great place, great price! Perfect for people who want to go out in and around Greenpoint, 15$ cab ride to manhattan, the roof is amazing. Do I need to say more? I don't think so! Totally worth the price, oh yeah and parking space right in front all the time!"
15338,8236431,21/10/13,592180,Riley,place was just as expected and andrea was very chill about us sleeping in and leaving whenever
15338,9771749,9/1/14,9532874,Ana,"This place is great to stay! The subway is about 15 minutes away walking. I was a little nervous before arriving because (Hidden by Airbnb) maps didn't make a lot of justice to the area, long story short, the area is pretty safe and I walked by myself a couple of times. There are three rooms in the loft, it has  half bathroom inside and the shower is outside. The place is pretty comfortable, kitchen is small but we managed to cook large meals for the four of us with no problem. The rooms are a bit small, but there's plenty of space in the living room to hangout. I read that the highway was noisy but we could sleep up to noon with no problems. Andrea has a great music collection, and movies as well, everything you need for a snowy day. The place is a bit messy, but I think ithe was mainly because all three rooms were rented the time we were there. I fully recommend this place, and I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Andrea for the hospitality :)"
15338,10893777,11/3/14,12395116,Felix,"This stay was just great! The room was quite charming. I loved the livingroom. I felt very comfortable. Andrea is an outstanding nice, and very relaxed host. "

This was my first time using this site and i'd say it was a solid first experience. I would recommend this place to anyone. I will admit, it was a little off the beaten path, with the nearest subway being a 15 minute walk away. On the contrary, there was some really good food and beer in this neck of the woods. Greenpoint Heights I believe it was called, is a amazing brunch spot only a few blocks away. Overall, good stay!"
15338,11931252,19/4/14,7258950,Stefan,"Everything was perfect. Andrea is a nice host!
the only disadvantage was that it was really load because the loft is next to the highway I-278.."
15338,13741737,3/6/14,10520517,Vicente,"I was there for one month and the house has good points and bads:

Good: bigger, roof, the area, the room, lnowing people if u want because u share apartment, near manhattan 20 minutes 

Bad: dirt ( the big problem), some subway noise (no so much), 15 minutes from the house to subway, the shower isn't in the same apartment. 

Andrea was a good owner with me and i hadn' t any problem. Thanks so much :) 
"
15338,14665046,23/6/14,15240909,Sophie,"My two friends and I  stayed at Andreas place for two nights. He is a very nice host and was very patient though we arrived later because we missed our bus.
The Apartment looks just as in the description, it is a big livingroom and a smaller bedroom with a bunk bed. We had fresh Sheets and towles but in a Girls view it could be a Little bit more clean...I would describe it as a typical Bachelor Apartment;-)
the bathroom with the shower is in Andreas Apartment so you have to get out to the hall way to get into the shower but that was ok!
There live some other People in the Apartment with us but they were all very nice.
Andreas place is very Close to Manhattan, it took us about 15 minutes to walk to the Metro Station and then another 15 minutes to get into Manhattan.

There is a TV with Netflix and lots of other movies so you wont get bored at night!
we had a awesome trip, we love New York City:) thanks Andrea for having us!!!"
15338,14730216,25/6/14,1820236,Jakob,"We were a group of 4 sharing one of Andreas rooms. Andrea is a very relaxed and talkative host, the first night he went out with us for food and drinks and gave us a rundown of greenpoint. He also got out of bed at midnight once to let us in when we didn't have keys. Fantastic.

The apartment is spacious with a great common area, fat speakers and a piano we played every day. However the apartment is pretty dirty and there's a ants nest somewhere close to the shower, which of course is not very nice. The experience was great nonetheless."
15338,17245197,9/8/14,1212269,Bryan,"I wouldn't suggest booking with Andrea. I booked an extension to my time at his place. Andrea cancelled my extension reservation while I was already a guest at his place and asked that I pay him cash. I questioned Andrea's motive for the cancellation and he told me not to worry and I could pay him upon my return from a weekend business trip. When I insisted that he take the cash, he told me he booked the room to someone else. He intended to move my things out of the room while I was away and inform me of his ""mistake"" upon my return. After questioning him further, Andrea admitted to the very unscrupulous behavior. I have no issue with anyone canceling a reservation; however, I do take issue when a host is dishonest about it and potentially leaves me without accommodation upon my return from a work trip out of the city at 1 AM in the morning. Furthermore, I take issue with a host additionally intending to take my things out of my room while I am away. I'm still unclear why Andrea wasn't honest about his desire to earn more money from a group booking and giving me the opportunity to find additional accommodation in a stress-free manner as opposed to his admission literally 15 minutes prior to my leaving the city for work. "
15338,18809593,1/9/14,2338511,Valton,"Andrea is a by-the-numbers host in terms of response time, settling his guests in, and laying down the house rules. He was extremely flexible and accommodating to my numerous special needs during my 2 week stay. If you are an open-minded and self guiding tenant, this space will serve your needs adequately: spartan, a tad funky, but a good place to hang your hat after a looooong night partying."
15338,19558235,14/9/14,20169752,Marc,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and it was a great one! Everything as described and Andrea was an awesome host. The room was small, but the common area totally makes up for it. It's a really neat loft, and it was cool to get on the rooftop. There's a lot of neat gear in the loft. It's a true city living environment! I will definitely stay again. Thanks again Andrea!!"
15338,20797574,5/10/14,9518093,Gemma,"We didn't see Andrea during the weekend, but the description was really accurate.
The appartment was well-located, but a bit dirty and noisy. I would recommend it for a short stay in New York.
"
15338,21114953,11/10/14,20462117,Linus,Andrea is a great host and I can definitely recommend this place for a true Brooklyn experience.
15338,21386796,16/10/14,20894802,Conor,"Location is pretty good. Not far from two subway stations and a cheap and quick cab from lots of good areas at night . It's a bit of a dead industrial area though so not the nicest walk at night. 

If you struggle with road noise this isn't the place for you. The motorway was right outside the window, I can sleep through it but my friends struggled.

Unfortunately, it is properly dirty!! Clearly hasn't been given a serious clean in months (and I'm genuinely no clean freak). The showroom is particularly grimy. 

A real shame because otherwise I would of given it a fairly good review. Wouldn't take that much effort on the hosts behalf. 

To be fair, it is cheap though so if you don't mind dirt and road noise then go for this.


"
15338,22537722,9/11/14,5616599,James,Andrea was a great host. Extremely welcoming and friendly. The place was exactly as listed. The place had a nice chilled feel to it and it was nice to share the flat with other AirBnB-ers who were also visiting NYC. I would definitely recommend staying here.
15338,27309941,1/3/15,1039491,Andy,Andrea was quick to reply with all my questions and was very friendly to us when we arrived. The room was cozy and was in a good convenient location with a gas station right downstairs of the apartment with many other shops around. It's a 0.7mile walk to the closest subway station so it's good to know the bus schedule if you don't want to walk that far. The room and shower can be quite cold in the winter as there's no central heating but a portable heater which takes a while to heat up the bedroom and shower room. Great location to explore Brooklyn from. 
15338,29046644,3/4/15,27975917,Melina,"Four of us stayed at this loft for 6 nights. We are all college students and didn't need anything fancy. We were taken back by the location at first but quickly grew comfortable. It's 3 small rooms that connect to a living room. They're quite cozy. It's a laid back living situation. The shower isn't in the room but it isn't a big inconvenience. Overall, if you can handle a pretty bohemian living situation then you'll be fine. The sounds of the highway can be pretty loud sometimes. Two of my friends minded a lot but two of us didn't care so that's all contingent on who you are. Andrea was very nice and told us everything up front. He even gave us suggestions for where to eat and what places to check out, a really great host. I would recommend staying here.   "
15338,32172464,15/5/15,27685213,Eva,"The apartmant is dirty. The location is fine, Andrea is nice, and it is really good price, if you don't mind that you live like in a dirty bachelor's apartmant."

15338,47071461,15/9/15,21993552,Joanna,"Andrea was a great host! He even let me come one night earlier when it turned out I have no place to stay.
His loft is spacious and filled with the most surprising things - records, instruments  and records again :)
Bedrooms are pretty simple and not too big - ideal if you only want to sleep there.
For any other activity common space is great. Access to the kitchen area as well as chillout living room.
Shower situation might be tricky for some as it's in the apartment down the hall, but other than that, everything works perfect.
This place is not fancy or super clean, but it's ideal for young, not demanding travallers who just need a spot to sleep and recharge batteries before heading to the city.
Neighbourhood is great - full of cool restaurants and bars. Plus live music."

15338,55937724,7/12/15,13021482,Josephine,"Don't be scared, when you arrive at the place.. the looks not that nice from outside but inside it is cool and one minute away you are in the most beatuiful area of Williamsburg! It takes just 30min to Manhattan and you have access to the roof were you can see the Manhatten Syline. It is a studio and Andrea works and lives there. Andrea is friendly and comunicative. 
We met nice people, who were airbnb guests too. The comunication with Andrea was very good!

 It was warm and cosy in the flat BUT unfortunately I have to say that it was not clean! It is ok if the host has not much time to clean it like in a hotel but as I am a host as well, I'd be embarrassed to offer my flat like that. Just take some dollars more to pay a person who cleans for you. The price would be still ok and at least the guests would feel more comfortable to shower

We had much privacy and you can cook, which is good. I'd have felt more comfortable if the door was working. You should fix that!

The price is good, the place is very nice so we had a good time there though! I still recommend it!"

15338,74314663,14/5/16,5238665,Jeffrey,"Andrea was great. I arrived a little early and he was able to make things happen so that I would have access to the apartment. 

The space itself is a lovely apartment. Don't be confused by the facade (it's an old factory), once you step in it has a cool ""Brooklyn"" feel to it. The people staying were extremely polite as well. 

Good experience if you're a young traveler. Wouldn't recommend for older travelers (with families and such), but still a great time. "
15338,77525687,1/6/16,34671680,Maria,"The space in general is very chilled out... The room we stayed in was comfortable and had a good use of the space. It is a little bit far from the subway but is a nice 10-15mim walk. Also is well located, you'll find erything you need around the corner. "
15338,104631639,27/9/16,41346223,David,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

The loft is as you expect and the pictures do it justice.  The roof is a great place for some fresh air or to catch some iconic views.  Close walk to food, bars, and the J line that takes you to straight to Manhattan.

If you're very lucky, two Russian guys will also be staying in the loft during your visit.  They are seriously nice guys that may even go barhopping with you if you ask nicely, just make sure to whisper 'Garry' to them inaudibly several times, they'll get it! :D"
15338,108844409,17/10/16,97753156,Timo,"Really nice loft, best for young guys or couples between 20 and 30. The bathroom could be cleaner. The rooftop is beautiful. Great view over Manhattan. 
See you next time there"
15338,116223617,28/11/16,33183107,Viktor,Nice place with specific design.
15338,120318650,9/12/16,4025316,Tiffany,"Things I loved about this space:
PRICE: You really can't beat it. It's not glamorous, but my husband and I weren't planning on spending much time in our airbnb anyway--we wanted to be out in the city--so we wanted something inexpensive, and this was perfect. 
LOCATION: It's close to Greenpoint and Williamsburg, which are both really cool areas. Also a 15 minute walk to the subway, which we used everyday. Super convenient.
SECURITY: You have to go through three doors before you even get to your room. From the street, there's a heavy door that opens into a stairwell, then another door that opens into a hallway, then another door that opens into the loft. All of these doors lock, which made us feel super safe.
SHARED SPACE: The place was a lot more private than I was expecting, which was nice. We had two housemates while we were there, and they were both incredible! The host, Andrea, was super kind and friendly.

Things I didn't love about this space:
DISCOMFORT: The bed was pretty uncomfortable, to be honest. We were so exhausted at the end of each day spent in Manhattan that we ended up sleeping pretty hard anyway, but if we hadn't been so tired, it might have been rough. 
BATHROOM: There's no shower in the loft space, you have to go across the hall and use Andrea's shower. A little awkward, but it is what it is. The shower itself isn't very clean, but after a long day, it still felt nice. The bathroom in the loft has a sink and a toilet, and it wasn't the cleanest either, but it did the job.

All in all, it's not a beautiful space or some kind of dream-getaway, but Andrea is really up-front about that. We knew what we were getting into, so we really enjoyed our time there. It's perfect for young solo travelers or young couples who just want a cheap spot to store their bags and catch a few hours of sleep in between frolicking around the city. It's not super clean or aesthetically pleasing, but the location is awesome, the cost is unbeatable, and the company was fantastic.
"
15338,121892369,19/12/16,80971986,Linzy,"Andrea is an amazing host. He's quick to respond, the perfect guide, and willing to come keep two travelers new to the city some company and show us around  town. while the outside of the place is not the most appealing, the interior is amazing (large space kept very clean and organized). If you want to stay in, he's got you covered. If you want to to out, it is a bit of a walk to get to places or the subway, but that's all manageable. An awesome place to stay while in NYC. "
15338,127869061,21/1/17,54903907,Tiara,"Andrea was so friendly and welcoming. I felt like I was visiting a family member. There was plenty of space, multiple bathrooms, he even has a amazon fire stick with netflix and prime hooked up to the flat screen. A stereo system with an aux chord if you're into playing music while your cooking or whatever.  Each room was private per guest with our own couch/futon and bed. Although we brought our own towels and toiletries he had those available per guest. There was access to the rooftop where we could smoke. Wouldn't have minded seeing more of him just because our first encounter was so great but there was plenty of privacy which I really liked. I've seen reviews on other airbnbs and I've read of some sketchy things hosts have done. I would highly recommend this to everyone especially international or business travelers. "
15338,130695920,7/2/17,113597508,Ashley,Was a great stay! Had my own privacy and very spacious! Had no problems and loved my time in New York while staying here!

15338,137973437,18/3/17,34133485,Connor,"I loved Andrea's place. It felt super homey and cozy. The room was quite small, but I loved it regardless. The bed and sheets were really nice and the kitchen was well-stocked with pots, pans, etc. The unit is in a converted warehouse, which means high ceilings and open layout but also means temperature swings. In the room and common area, there are heaters and fans to combat that, though. The apartment is right next to a freeway but that didn't bother me too much. Of all the Airbnb's that I've stayed at in NYC, this is the only one that I would seek out to stay in again."
15338,140232765,28/3/17,7373772,Roberto,Great value for this room. 10 mins on foot to the underground that goes straight to Midtown. Price/quality ratio cannot be beaten nowadays in NY. Andrea is a very nice host. Highly recommended
15338,148414513,30/4/17,97456811,Ona,"Andrea is super amicable. Upon my arrival, he showed me a tour of the warehouse and gave me a beer. I actually lost my keys the first night there so I crashed at a friend's place and the next day I met him for brunch and then paid for new keys to be made. He was very patient and lenient. He made sure I was comfortable. 

My only (and biggest) issue was the dust. There was like a thin film of dust coating the bedroom. My allergies are really terrible but luckily I had allergy meds on me. I think the place could use a deep clean cuz even on meds I coughed up a lung.  One day it was really hot and I wanted to turn on the fan but I could see it was coated with dust so I just opened the windows instead and saw dust on my hands after lifting the window open. "
15338,151363612,12/5/17,55179139,Kaidi,"We choosed the place because of privacy. Not very clean, but after couple of days it did not bother us anymore. The bedroom is exactly next to very traffic highway and we used earplugs and then it was ok. Andrea was very helpful and nice. Overall it is great place to stay."
15338,159045523,9/6/17,46338373,Kaitlyn,"Andrea's a fantastic host! He's flexible when he can be, and there's always clear line of communication which is really important when you're arriving in a big new city you've never been before! It's a pretty cool loft, it really had an authentic New York feel to it. It's not prim and perfect, it certainly feels lived in but that's a nice appeal to it. It's entirely worth the price. 

I wish I could've spent some more time in the loft, Andrea has tons of awesome records/CD's/Books. Even though we never even got the chance to meet him, definitely felt like we did just based on his artistic selections! 

The location is pretty perfect. There's a gas station just below you, so you can start your day out with a water/get smokes/ whatever stuff you get a gas station lol. 

Tons of restaurants and beautiful parks just within walking distance. (Try out 5 leaves!! so dang good! esp. breakfast!) About 15 minutes. There's a music venue that we specifically went to New York that was just 5 minutes away from this location. The Brooklyn Steel. It's a perfect location if you find a good show there! 

The only thing that I'd warn to expect is that the shower is very small, and the shower head has a pretty weak stream that can't be moved in any direction (i'm small so it just shot me in the face the whole time, pretty comical) and the freeway really does whizz by your head the whole night. But it's true! If you can get to sleep with ambient noise, this is no bother. We actually liked the sound of the traffic. Again, an authentic NY feel! Although the sun does burst into your face and force you to get up in the morning. Which was no problem for us because we wanted to see as much as we could. But if you're planning on spending a day hungover in bed, it might not be the most comfortable! 

Overall, this place was perfect for the kind of trip we were taking. A safe place to lay our head, somewhere to shower, towels, soap, a good line of communication. You can't beat it for the price. And Andrea's a fantastic host. I highly recommend! "

The place is as described: quite basic setup but a good value for a place to sleep. At first it feels like a bit of an awkward location, but once you know your way around you’ll appreciate the area and easy way to get around with public transport."
15338,266818253,20/5/18,85984439,Elena,"You should know going into this apartment that you won’t be sitting in the lap of luxury but it’s a very cool place with a good vibe, especially when you have nice roommates (which you usually do). More space than I’ve seen anywhere in NYC plus free street parking. And Andrea is a fantastic host! Very communicative and responsive to any questions or complaints."
15338,268285445,24/5/18,41278171,Patricia,"This place was so much fun! Tons of music to enjoy. The roof offers an amazing view and is a great way to spend your evening with some beverages and snacks, especially in good weather. The location is great for catching the L or for touring Brooklyn. A little road noise, but nothing that kept us from sleeping. Think of Hotdog, the neighborhood outdoor alley cat, when you bring back leftovers. We really enjoyed our stay!"
15338,273272841,5/6/18,81093876,Valentina,We loved that place and we would surely recommend staying there
15338,287032473,7/7/18,128424781,Maynor,Andrea's place has a lot of soul. From the people who come in and out to the people who live there. Kerry and his wife were very hospitable and very cool people to hang out with. The A/C alone made this place worth it to me. I'd definitely recommend for people traveling alone or with one other person. 
15338,303072489,6/8/18,123670344,Amy,"like some of others mentioned already, it is not the place if you want a spotlessly clean space. But it is close to Manhattan and has wonderful rooftop which has 360 view. Personally the best thing about this place was Kerry and Lily. I strongly suggest to talk to them, they are the best people ever! We had wonderful time hanging around and a great rooftop bbq that I will never forget. I'm glad I chose this place. "
15338,309080576,17/8/18,57119983,Tim,Nice and easy stay.
15341,7755151,1/10/13,1689491,Yvonne,"First off, it's an super spacious apartment.  700sq ft is hard to come by around here. Ted was an amazing host.  When the last renter left the space a bit sparse of bed linens, he was quick to bring a bag full over. The kitchen has the essentials but I didn't do any cooking with so many places to eat around here.  It's within 3-5 min walk to subway station (Website hidden by Airbnb) so it was easy to get around.  The internet speed is fast, the water pressure in the shower is amazing, and the laundry in the basement is very convenient. Overall great place to stay for a month."
15341,8928464,26/11/13,6995145,Murat,"Location: Amazing! At the intersection of Nolita and LES. Soho and Little Italy as well as subway stations serving to many lines are within 3-5 minutes walking distance. Wholefoods is just a couple of buildings away.

Building: Mid-rise condo building with elevators, hard to come by in Lower Manhattan. 24/7 security and front desk receiving your packages on your behalf. They are very polite and helpful, offering help to carry your luggage or bags if you are coming from grocery for instance. A well equipped gym and laundry facilities are available in the basement floor.

Apartment: Quite spacious and hard to come by in Lower Manhattan. In my opinion it can easily accomodate 4 people as there are two sofas in the living room. The apartment receives ample sunshine. The queen size bed is sturdy yet extremely comfy. TV is small but has lots of channels. Internet is pretty fast. Lots of storage is available. Abundant kitchenware is available. The oven, stovetop, microwave and fridge are all large size. The rear side of the large mirrors in the bathroom has quite a lot of shelves which would easily accomodate your personal grooming supplies like comb, razor, shaver, toothbrush etc. The water pressure of the shower was great and got hot instantly. The toilet flushing power/pressure was amazing. It won't get blocked unlike many old apartments in Lower Manhattan. I did not personally meet any of the neighbors but the people I saw when entering/existing the building or the elevators were quite well-dressed and neat. The radiators generate a great deal of heat so I am sure you won't get cold even in the coldest days of winter. I assume the A/C would work great in the summer because the panels serve as both radiators and A/C with different settings. Last, we received the apartment in a very clean condition. Therefore the additional payment Ted charges guests for ""professional cleaning"" is well justified as his cleaners are professional indeed.

Host: I did not personally meet Ted as he had left the keys to the front desk and I left the keys to them when I moved out. This allows for very convenient 24/7 check-in and -out. Nonetheless, he was very prompt and helpful when I contacted him via email, SMS or his mobile. Before our check-in when I had asked him about whether towels are available in the apartment, he noticed there were none and arranged that brand new sets for two people to be available in the apartment prior to our check-in.

Negatives: None, if you don't consider the absence of hair dryer as such.

Final words: I cannot recommend this apartment and host highly enough."
15341,10654555,2/3/14,484607,Naveen,"An incredible apartment in a great part of the city. We stayed here for three months and could not have been happier with the space. The building has a lot of amenities that made for an even better stay: a doorman for packages, laundry in the basement, fast internet access, full cable TV, a full kitchen.

You're essentially right there in between SoHo / LES / Chinatown, so everything and anything we needed was just a walk away. It turned out to be a great home away from home for a few months and just what we needed.

Ted is also incredibly responsible, either over text or email. That made the experience that much better.

If we ever needed a place to stay in the city, I would definitely choose this spot, both for the neighborhood it's in as well as the convenience of the apartment.
"
15341,13103914,19/5/14,6988688,Dante,"The apartment was very nice, comfortable, and of good size for a Manhattan apartment.   The location is, as described, excellent for access to Chinatown, Soho, etc.  There is a subway station just around the corner.  The building is secure with a 24-hour doorman.   Ted was very responsive to questions, and was a good host.

I highly recommend this apartment if you want to stay in this area of Manhattan.  I will likely stay there again."
15341,19671973,16/9/14,15545906,Daren,"Ted's apartment is a great base in New York.  There are so many neighbourhoods (Nolita, Soho, Little Italy, Chinatown, LES, Noho) within five minutes and it's very well located for a number of subway lines.  Lots of choices for food and WholeFoods just couple of blocks away.

The apartment is described as spartan but I found it just perfect.  It was free of all clutter, but with bedding, towels and kitchen equipment.  TV and wifi all in good working order.

A good downtown apartment.

Ted always very quick to respond to questions or requests."
15341,26521098,15/2/15,8278654,Lele,"Great location. Close to everything you need. Great apartment, door man is so nice. And Ted was so helpful during my trip. I have changed my schedule for 3 times, and he always try to fit in my schedule. "

He was always available for questions when needed and very responsive. The location is good, right next to Soho and close to the subway and Whole Foods. Apartment was as described."
15341,40963024,3/8/15,720940,Liliana,"My host, Ted, was an amazing host. He was very polite and nice with me at the time of checking-in/ out. I was also very impressed with the apartment’s accurate description. The apartment is sunny, clean and spacious. The oven, microwave and fridge are all large size. The Internet speed is fast, the water pressure in the shower and the toilet flushing are really good, there is also a hair dryer in the bathroom and plenty closets in the bedroom. There is an excellent laundry in the basement and the people at the front desk are very nice and helpful with your daily packages. The neighborhood is near many good trendy places, boutiques and great restaurants in NY. I will love to stay again in this apartment on my next trip to the city."

A minute walk to the J subway line so very convenient if commuting to the Financial District. I stayed here for two months and would recommend it. Ted was very responsive and pleasant to deal with. "
15341,99636131,5/9/16,5750942,Gabriele,"Overall ok apartment and large enough. Furniture and amenities are a bit old and tired and I would not certainly call it ""luxury"". 

The street is Bowery, not great due to the nearby soup kitchen. But you have nolita and soho at a stone throw, lovely areas full of coffee shops and restaurants. Also great access to several subway lines. 

So luxury it's not, but it gets the job done "

15341,251820847,8/4/18,6138974,Sonali,The apartment is spacious by NYC standards. The building staff is great. Kitchen was well stocked with appliances and utensils. The mattress was a bit uncomfortable because it’s a bit soft so we ended up using the futon quite a bit. Overall a good stay
15341,303976546,8/8/18,46594860,Richard,"Almost SOHO,  just one block away. Ted is right it is SPARTAN, that is accurate, but for location and friendly doormen, bldg cleaners, you cannot beat this place. Staff at building is 5 star. The elevator and door men were the most important to us and that is what we got. Thank you TED!!"

Durante nuestra estancia no tuvimos ningun tipo de problema, es más Cristina nos ayudo en todo lo posible.El barrio es muy tranquilo y bonito cuando te pones a pasear por sus calles. La casa se encuentra en medio de dos estaciones de metro, lo cual facilita la movilidad para ir a Manhattan. Cristina es encantadora y simpatica y tiene una vivienda muy acogedora.

We both would highly recommend her and her lovely little home.

The apartment of Cristina  is as cozy as it seems on the pictures.The room is very spacious , lovely, clean and well organized. The bed is great. Cristina was a wonderful host, the location was awesome and everything went smoothly She was very helpful on providing precise and useful information about how to navigate the city. Her directions to the place were excellent, as well as the recommendations on places to eat  in the neighborhood. The location in Willimasburgh is excellent too - very close to subway and all the good stuff in Brooklyn is walkable. I stayed in the flat one month, it was a wonderful experience, and I hope to have a chance to visit her again. Cristina is very relaxed and friendly and happy for you to do your thing - thank you!! Description and pictures fit very well."
15385,22192334,1/11/14,383623,Melissa,"Cristina was a lovely host during my stay in her apartment - the room is comfortable and cozy. However there was a bit of street noise at night and the room got a little cold in the evening, but other than that the apartment is clean and extremely well kept with enough bedding to keep you warm :) The apartment is in a good location, about 10 mins from the Bedford L stop and close to all amenities, and a hop skip and jump from great bars, restaurants and boutiques."
15385,33780735,1/6/15,28166834,Verena,"We stayed in Cristinas cozy home for one month and really enjoyed our time there! Cristina is a very welcoming and gentle person. The pictures give a good impression of the flat, which was clean, tidy and very good located! We loved all the little Cafés nearby and the short walk to the waterfront. We would recommend to stay with her and would come again. Thanks again Cristina for being our host, we had a great time!"
15385,45060728,31/8/15,30924831,Duyen,Cristina er en hyggelig vert. Hun er lett å prate med og er vennlig. Utleiestedet var koselig og rent. Jeg likte veldig godt nabolaget med masse koselige spisesteder/kafeer. Williamsburg kan absolutt anbefales. 
15385,49097633,1/10/15,9199550,Paula,"La experiencia en casa de Cristina no ha podido ser mejor. 

Mi amiga Sara y yo hemos estado un mes viviendo en este apartamento que ha sido nuestro hogar. Cristina nos dio todas las facilidades posibles: nos hizo un juego de llaves extra, nos recomendó sitios y nos dio a probar su deliciosa cocina.

La habitación es muy bonita, con espacio de sobra para la ropa y la cama es muy, muy cómoda. Todo el apartamento está decorado con muy buen gusto. La habitación no tiene puerta, pero no ha sido ningún problema: una cortina proporciona la intimidad suficiente.

El barrio nos ha enamorado a ambas. Encontrarás todo lo que necesites: supermercados, tiendas vintage y, sobre todo, sitios para tomar una cerveza y comer algo. El metro queda a 10 minutos y es un paseo agradable. En menos de media hora podrás estar caminando por Manhattan.

Pero lo mejor de este piso es, sin duda, Cristina. ¡Muchas gracias por hacer que nuestra estancia en Williamsburg sea una experiencia que nunca olvidaremos!"

15385,61186257,1/2/16,15079415,Tom,"I have stayed in a lot of Airbnbs in New York and Cristina's is one of the nicest and certainly the best value. I stayed for one month at the begining of 2015. She welcomed me on arrival and is a very easy person to connect with and is a warm, funny and interesting. The room has a lovely energy to it, feels very laid back, and has great light in the morning. The kitchen is great and we had many nice dinners there. Cristina told me about many good places in the neighbourhood. The area is great, quick walk to the subway, great bars and restaurants around. Although you are in the heart of the action the room is very peaceful at night. Highly recommended."

The appartment is tiny but perfectcly tidy, and very very luminous. Also the cuisine is fully equiped, so if you like to cook it's really great. I stayed for a month and felt in the flat like i was home ! Cristina was a great host and made everything she could to make my arrival and my stay nice and easy-going. So if you're travelling by yourself i would highly recommend to stay with Cristina in this amazing neighborhood !!"
15385,255809466,21/4/18,183575271,Suhad,"Christina is a pleasant and hospital host and made feel at ease in her apartment. It is my first time in the States and her tips were very useful. She sent me clear instructions on how to get into the apartment at first when I arrived ( as she was at work) and this was very easy and useful. She also keeps instructions on how to do stuff in the apartment which makes it very comfortable. 

The room is clean and although tiny but I had plenty of space for my stuff. Bathroom is clean and overall the apartment is comfy and most importantly bright due to the sunlight. 

I will definitely recommend her place for friends coming to NY"
15385,268007205,23/5/18,648745,Anja,"I stayed at Cristinas place for a month.
The apartment is really small but super cozy. The room is just enough for the stay - with a real bed, window, closet and some space for sitting and drinking your morning coffee or evening tea - as I was anyway out exploring all day. . The location is great as there are connections to the M and L train just 5/8 min walk. Whole foods market, laundry, restaurants and yoga studios are just on the corner. This area is super calm but close to the happenings in Williamsburg. So I would totally recommend it to anyone.
I really enjoyed it and would totally come back!"
15385,282864649,28/6/18,75614601,Kat,"Cristina's place is exactly as described - incredibly clean and cozy, in a FANTASTIC location close to everything in Williamsburg and Cristina herself is super-helpful and easy-going.  I stayed a full month and everything was so easy.  It is a small place but I think that adds to the charm - and it never feels cramped... which is partly due to Cristina being such an easygoing host. If you're looking for something great value in an awesome neighborhood, I'd definitely recommend staying here."
15385,297937946,28/7/18,182821851,Priyanka,"Cristina was a lovely host. She gives you maximum space and is adorable to be around. She has beautifully maintained her apartment with plants all over. The place is sparkling clean and she takes a good amount of effort to make sure it stays the same way. The neighbourhood is pretty lively and is close to domino park, which offers a beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline and the sunset. I will recommend staying with Cristina any day. :)"

The room was more than warm.:) We could use all facilities including kitchen and refrigerator. It is cheap regarding what we could get. The owners were also friendly and helpful. We really appreciate it. :D"

The room was exactly same what you see in this picture. Moreover, bus station is very close to this house so it's very easy to get to the subway station. It's perfect place for people who want a comfortable travel :) Thanks!"

15493,31472,26/3/10,80893,Andrew,"We just got back from staying a week at Thais and Greg's Apartment. We had a wonderful time and are very happy we went with the Cozysuite! From the time we checked in to the time we left, they were very helpful in helping us get settled and made recommendations of places to go. They also helped get us a taxi to the airport. The price is great for everything you get! The place was very clean with a modern feel, we really felt at home. The location is very convenient as well; you're not on Manhattan, but a short walk or bus ride to the subway station will put you on Manhattan in no time! If you're worried about safety of your belongings (which you don't have to be); from the front door on the street to your room there are 5 locks, which you will have your own keys to - we felt very safe. Upon check-in you will be given internet access; it was very fast and safe, so if you have a computer, I would recommend bringing one. The only minor thing I would have liked to see in the Cozysuite would be a microwave, it would have been more convenient to be able to re-heat leftovers or prepare a quick meal on the go. Again, the place is great; you won't be disappointed with your choice. When you're on vacation, or need a place to stay, you want it to feel like home, and we definitely felt at home while staying at the Cozysuite!"

Locks on all the doors, it feels really safe.  The neighborhood is mixed - some old families who will greet you on the street, but some shady characters will, too."
15493,46214,25/5/10,90269,Kooldolphin,"CozySuite Fortress

overall it was a good stay. but here are the details. for the price, i give it 4stars.
---------------------------------------------------------------

1****.i saw 2 coackroaches (one in the kitchen/front room area and the other in the bathroom) the first 2 nights i stayed at Cozysuite. it made me really paranoid. 

2. one thing i hate is when you email some one and they dont reply. there were 2 occasions {before i went into NYC) i contacted Cozysuite and i was ignored (bare in mind that before i paid for the apartment, she was replying to  my messages quickly). as soon as i paid, she didnt even bother replying - UNTILL i rang her.

3.When she comes back into the apartment to tidy up ETC, she makes alot of noise i.e turns the TV very loud for the Kid. and sometimes shouts at the Kid ( which is very disturbing)

4. Noisy neighbours (sometimes), 

5.the TOUGHEST pillows EVER. ( those cushions/pillows + Bedsheet in the picture...were not there) it was replaced by two very TOUGH pillows and a thin blanket.

6:no iron, no microwave


+


1****. its very spacious,you get given your own keys,and its mostly tidy (nice bathroom), 

2.very close to a subway/undergound that takes you straight into Manhattan in 20 minutes

3.Neighbourhood looked dodgy at the beginning but i later saw that its cool.

4.Nice Lady

...i hope i helped."
15493,52384,13/6/10,104439,Cristina,"I stayed at the Cozysuite inn with my boyfriend for 10 days, it wasn't a wonderful experience because of the little empty room (there is just a little closed with only 3 hanging)no chairs or bedside table nor lamp shade to read something but the most important thing is the small bed not suitable for two people but just for one specially when it's hot temperature. I agree with the girl below who said that is difficult to get air in the room (We are the couple mentioned in his review) we had to leave all the doors and windows open to breathe a bit.
A good idea is the nice access to the roof but there are only two patio chairs and all is a bit shabby...all the apartment it could be a wonderful place if improved!!! The good thing is that the price is very cheap!
Thais was extremely friendly and helpful for informations and suggestions, we saw her two times, but the only problem was that when she comes back into the apartment to tidy up or for oter hosts she makes alot of noise!
People of the district have not done much notice of us, but one Sunday we went to one of their churches they have welcomed us and were very kind to us.
The area at the expense of appearances is fairly quiet (apart from the loud music of the cars) and in any case there is often the police control the streets."
15493,65212,16/7/10,148674,Klodiana,"
The cozy suite was very nice. It is a great place to stay in New York and not pay a lot of money. It is a very convenient and close to public transportation, which can take you wherever you want in New york.

15493,69854,27/7/10,164383,Lia,Unless you can tolerate extreme heat do not stay here in summer. The room is advertised to accommodate 2 however the bed is only a single and most definately sleeps only one person. Lucky we had a self inflating matress with us so one of us could sleep on floor.The room does have a fan but it is only for a desktop and does not make any difference to heat of room.
15493,91086,6/9/10,185124,Guillermina,"The appartment is quite simple, but it is confortable, nice, neat and clean specially when considering the price. In the room named ""fortress"" there are beds for just one person (another bed can be improvised by using two big cushions brought from the living room, that can be used as one big matress to be placed on the floor; that's the way we did it)
In the room ""citadelle"" there's enough room for two people, but there's not even a coat rack where to hang your clothes. This is a very small detail that would render your guests a more confortable service.
Moreover, the place is several blocks away from the nearest metro station, though the neighborhood is not unsafe at all, even at night hours.

15493,108697,30/9/10,225283,Steven,"CozySuite is a great stay for the price. Excellent location as just 15mins walk away from the Utica station. Great WiFi connection and the place is kept really clean - ESP the bathroom. I would definitely recommend this to those on a budget. Thais is a great host but she might want to get someone to remove the cart on the staircase... My only gripe. Sincerely, Steven from Malaysia."
15493,145619,28/11/10,262873,Danica,"Likes: clean space, functional kitchen with cutlery and plates, quiet area, and the host was very friendly.

Dislikes: the shower was extremely slow, no toilet tissue, no soap, a relatively lengthy walk to the subway and takes on average 45 minutes to get to midtown Manhanttan, and even longer to get to Queens on the subway. There were unstated surcharges (hefty additional taxes and service fees) at check-out. "
15493,1170562,23/4/12,1753717,Shaniss,"Super logement au coeur de Brooklyn, dans les brownstone, très propre, cuisine pratique et accès sur le toit pour le sport du matin ! Le métro est à deux blocks, très pratique."
15493,20127858,23/9/14,20971141,Annie,"Upon my arrival to New York it was very easy to get to this location. If you love a cultured and fun area this is the location to stay. Thais was very welcoming and gave helped me with a quick look around in the apartment. I loved that it was very clean, and the room was a great space for one or two guests. Despite my early departure Thais was very understanding and easy to communicate with. Great place to stay for a visit to Brooklyn! "
15493,42754774,15/8/15,33879512,Henrike,"My friend and me had a wonderful stay at Thais in New York. The room became our home for the week. It was great to come back to a nice and quiet neighbourhood after a long day of exploring the city. We had the whole kitchen and commonroom area to ourselves. We loved the location as it is a real neighbourhood so you get to see that side of NYC as well. We didn't mind the 20 minutes train ride to the center at all - we think it is part of the exploring.
It was clean and we felt save!
We would recommend that place. Thank you very much!"
15493,101287007,12/9/16,382418,Noe,The place had all the essentials. We were satisfied with the listing. The host accepted our booking the day of arrival. We were extremely grateful.

I can certainly suggest it as viable alternative to regular hotel. Excellent cost performance. Very kind and helpful owners. Thais, thanks for arranging the taxi early morning to the airport. It was cheaper than regular one."
15509,28782,8/3/10,16082,Mike,I stayed with Tahis & Greg for 3 days and was very pleased with my stay.  1/2 a block to M46 bus which takes you to subway station to catch A train express into midtown.  Very clean and exactly as pictured.  I was worried at first about the area as i had never stayed there before but didnt have any problems even when returning late at nite.  Will stay with Tahis & Greg again.

15509,98319,16/9/10,202694,Viet-Hong,"We really enjoyed our stay at cozysuite!
It's not in manhatten, but actually it's ok. There is a bus right on the corner of the apartement. So, it was only a 3min walk to the bus. The bus takes you right to the station and if you take the subway it takes you about 20min to get to times square. So it's not a big deal.
There is also a supermarket right next to the apartement and everything is clean.
You can use pots and dishes in the kitchen. It's everything there.
The owner was really nice. She help us to get a taxi and answered all our questions.
The only thing that was bad, was that the bed was actually a single bed. So, it was a bit hard to share it. But therfor it's super cheap and you don't have to share a bathroom with so many people like you would if you take a hostel.
So, I would totally recommend it!!!"
15509,103512,23/9/10,226932,Jason,"Staying at the Cozysuite in September 2010 I found that Greg & Thais were affable hosts. Primarily you can't beat the Cozysuites for value. 
If you are on a tight budget go ahead and book you will not regret a thing! Checking out Brooklyn from here was an out of this world experience! The only thing is, great coffee in the mornings is at least 20 minutes away from waking up, so maybe bring your own to get yourself going. Best wishes, JASON C Sydney Australia. "
15509,105572,26/9/10,228351,Natalia,"1.Not a welcoming neibourhood for white people.
2.No hot water.
3.Part of the deposit wasn't given back without any explanation."
15509,112247,5/10/10,45145,Mete,"The place is value for money. Peaceful to stay and I felt pretty secure at the nightime too. For women area can still be little frightening. If about 45 minute-trip to Manhattan doesen't bother you, I can recommend this. Not maybe the best place for people visiting New York City for the first time. Housekeeping could have been little better, for example many times there was no toilet paper available and the fridge was quite dirty, both which I guess should been host's responsibility."
15509,131755,1/11/10,273335,Lindsey,"This was a clean, safe place to stay however it had some draw backs.  The fees really add up.  For 2 people over 4 nights it ended up costing us $71/night, not the $52 advertised.  Also, the pictures show a room with really nice bedding and lots of pillows.  It's the same room, just minus all the pillows and cozy suede comforter.  Instead each bed has one plastic covered flat pillow, clean sheets and some old nubby felt-like blankets (there were other people's hairs stuck to the one I had).  Also, while we were there one night the heater was on to the point that we were sweating and the other 3 nights we really froze with no heat at all.  The living room and kitchen are nice, there are dishes and cooking amenities so you can save some money on not eating out.  The 10 minute walk from the A or C train was also not bad."

15509,53249201,7/11/15,43532638,Mélusine,"""CozySuite Sanctuary"" is a very good place ; the bedroom is clean, clear and nice, very quiet (a benediction after all the noise and bustle of Manhattan). Commons parts are also great, clean and large enough to be share with others tenants. Obviously, remember it's not a hostel so take your shower gel and all the little things you usually need in travel ;) Thais is nice and discreet and... In fact, there is nothing wrong.
If you have a low budget and are looking for a bed to sleep after a long day and a  safe neighbourhood with great restaurants and grocery stores, it's the perfect place. And NYC is so extraordinary ! "
15729,48572,31/5/10,121943,Heather-Rose,"When we had to stay in NYC an extra day during Memorial Day weekend and accommodations were hard to find, my son and I stayed for one night at David's ""Village Green"" apartment in Red Hook, Brooklyn.  David was out of town for the night but his girlfriend (who also lives in the apartment) handled everything efficiently, giving us the key to the apartment and directions to the subway/bus.  The private room was comfortable, on the first floor with windows overlooking the street.  It seemed like a quiet neighborhood.  Judging from the books on the bookshelves, David has an excellent and eclectic taste in literature!  The bathroom had a large, modern tiled shower that was enjoyable.  All of our living space was clean and well-maintained.  There is a kitchen downstairs but we never used it.  Also living in the apartment is a friendly cat who came to visit us.  The only issue we had with David's place is that it's not that convenient for activities in Manhattan.  The subway lines are several blocks away, and while there's a bus stop right at the corner, the bus only goes into downtown Brooklyn, from which you must take the subway to go into Manhattan.  However, once on the subway, you'll be in the city in a few stops.  For budget-minded travelers who have time and patience to deal with going a little bit out of the way, David's place is a great choice."
15729,83519,23/8/10,202364,Dennis,"David was really nice, the room was great.  No problems at all."
15729,91522,6/9/10,217461,Akilan,Clean apartment. Nice guy. 
15729,241356,26/4/11,499481,Rob,"David & Julie were very helpful and welcoming hosts, they Mister Bitzer (their violently friendly cat) was a very welcome presence too.

Our plans mostly involved Manhattan, but we couldn't afford to stay there at such short notice (I was a bit lazy sorting it out). Nevertheless Red Hook is a charming and safe neighbourhood, and nice and quiet at night (which in a city that can be so exhausting is very important - on my previous trip to NYC 10 years ago, I stayed uptown Manhattan and came home more stressed than when I'd left due to 10 days of pretty much continual noise).
"
15729,285566,28/5/11,608638,Luis,"Very comfortable place to stay at. The host was a great, and was real cool with us. I enjoyed my time there, and recommend this place if you are looking to stay in the Brooklyn area."
15729,289228,30/5/11,324972,Alice,"David and his girlfriend Julie were fantastic hosts and very responsive to all of our questions and needs. They even offered us use of their bikes, which I so appreciated, even though I was wearing a prohibitively long dress. I'd forgotten the compact size of New York abodes, but our room was clean and comfortable. The location of Village Green is like a 20-ish minute walk to the nearest station, but it's a great neighborhood to walk in (as evidenced by the young families and their baby strollers nonchalantly crossing highway overpasses). They live within walking distance to a park, a waterfront, and fun restaurants in Red Hook (Hope & Anchor being one of them and vegan-friendly)."
15729,297603,4/6/11,640381,Holly,"Not great to be honest, wouldnt recommend staying here. Long walk to the subway, had to put sheets on the bed ourselves late at night, and had to ask for a glass of water. "

Merci David"
15729,324775,20/6/11,667865,Colin,"Dave was a great guy...super friendly and willing to share his home. Village Green is in a cool part of Brooklyn with some good eats right around the corner...including some great Stumptown Coffee.

15729,377858,17/7/11,634407,Richard,"If what you need is an easy place to hang your hat without a lot of hassle or structure to your stay, this is it. The other dwellers' noise could be a deterrent if you turn in earlier that young people."

David is someone very nice, well educated, cultivated, funny and interesting.
His english is very easy to understand, he gave us advices and good informations for visiting NYC. We spoke a lot with him. He showed us great places and we have been to a restaurant whith him. 
The district is safe but in the night there is nobody in the district. 
You must like animals, there is one dog and two cats. Don't be afraid of them they are very nice and they need affection. Maybe too much lol.
The house was clean. Don't look everything in details.

David was great, really helpful & pointed out the must do's of NYC. Strongly recommend his place as the Red Hook neighborhood is a hidden gem within Brooklyn

Cheers Mate,

15729,646479,19/10/11,1091676,Jorgen,"David is a nice person, which is more than you can say about the small room he rents out. It had a bed, yes, but it looked more like a storage room in a second hand furniture shop than a bedroom you would ask money for. It was, to be honest, quite a mess, and not very cosy. We had rented the room for three persons, but were happy that David let the third person put his mattress in the basement room. Once you figure out the bus system, it is pretty simple to go to Manhattan via bus and subway. But in conclusion, we have for a similar price rented far more attractive and better situated places in Brooklyn.  "
15729,1106493,10/4/12,147421,Lucinda,"David and Juli were lovely hosts, and made our stay easy and comfortable. Unfortunately, the place didn't look remotely like the pictures, and was not spic and span. We were primarily there to sleep, so we didn't mind terribly. The apartment is located perfectly in Red Hook, and we were able to walk and explore a good amount within 5 minutes of their place. "
15729,1169271,23/4/12,680434,Ethan,"My stay at Village Green worked out very well. I had business in the area so it was extra convenient, but its not a bad walk to the subway to Manhattan if you want to go there. David is a very pleasant fellow and I felt welcome and comfortable right away. I would recommend this airbnb to any one or two people visiting NYC. "
15729,2209029,5/9/12,3282324,Sir,"A place to avoid. Not sure the linens were clean; they didn't smell, but they didn't look fresh. Cheap flimsy pillows. Grotty shower floor with moldy curtain. Towel draped over the bed railing. Not sure if it was clean either. It felt like being ripped off. Clearly no effort whatever to make the place inviting. Like someone knew they were going away for a weekend, and decided to make a few bucks by letting someone sleep in their bed; they threw a spare towel on the bed and took off leaving the rest to AirBnB. I looked around for clean linens and would have put them on myself, but couldn't find any.

I was invited to use the kitchen, but I opened the refrigerator and it looked like a horror show from a cut rate fraternity house.

I understand that David has more than one place. Though I haven't seen the others, I wouldn't chance it."
15729,2712587,24/10/12,1940007,Adam,"Place was available last minute. Room and bath were clean but cluttered. Not in a bad way, just lived in. Dog was very sweet too. "
15729,4176601,15/4/13,5123941,Carol,"There was nearby parking which is a huge plus. The host wasn't very friendly but quick and to the point. Set up in apartment is unusual. It was moderately clean, I was able to use the washer and dryer which is a good thing because I had to wash my sheets before I was able to actually sleep in them. I didn't really appreciate the used band-aid I found in between the sheets ( especially since I asked for a honest genuine response as to when the sheets were last cleaned). Not cool at all."
15729,9123770,8/12/13,5776552,Colin,This is a great apartment in a really great neighborhood. David was incredibly flexible about check-in time and made the trip super easy. Parking in the neighborhood was a breeze. The bed was comfortable.

The 5 of us had plenty of space to relax after long shopping days in NYC. All the rooms were clean and inviting.  It was great to have a large living room and a kitchen too.

Dimitri is a great host and was so helpful to us before and during our stay.  It was a great comfort to know that he was living so close by and we felt very secure.  We were made to feel very welcome and our stay in the apartment made the trip a success.

This is a perfect place to stay in New York - a quiet, friendly Brooklyn neighbourhood that is close to some nice restaurants and bars. A subway station is a few blocks away.

Bedrooms are all good sizes and the flat itself was pretty big overall, especially compared to most NY and Brooklyn apartments. The location was ace; perfectly positioned within Prospect Heights, a short walking distance to Prospect Park, Fort Greene, and an easy subway ride to Williamsburg and  Manhattan. Would definitely stay there again. Thanks to Dimitri and his family who were all super laid-back and very accommodating. We had the best time!"

On the day we left, we were allowed to keep our luggage in the apartment until 6 PM - although Dimitri had other quests arriving the same night - and he even called cabs for us to take us to the airport!
Without hesitation, we can most warmly recommend the apartment to anyone! Thanks again, Dimitri!"

We had enough room for 4 adults and 4 children.  Dimitri and his family were very quiet and so were the family in the apartment below us.  Everything you needed was supplied.  
There wasn't a laundry but a short walk away there was one that you could drop off you washing and pick it up later in the day for a minimal cost.  
Many fantastic restaurants, especially the little Italian one we found down the road, ask Dimitri for the name.
Next door is a small store that you can buy emergency items and a block away is a supermarket.
Subway stations are close by and Dimitri supplies you with a map of the area.
For families with young children there is a playground across the road.

We arrived having driven from WI to find our host, Dimitri, ready and willing to help us haul everything from our car. He showed us each room of the apartment, noting particular aspects, explained the dishwasher procedure and the thermostat, showed us where extra supplies were. He was always open to our questions and was clear in his explanations. He is a gracious and humorous man with much musical talent. 

We had come to Brooklyn for our daughter's wedding and were very pleased that five of us had plenty of room in the apartment. I was also pleased that there was an ironing board and an iron. Art work painted by Dimitri's mother graced the walls and was beautiful.

The apartment is conveniently located near a small grocery store,  of which we took advantage several times.

Parking was not as difficult as we had anticipated. We always found a spot quite close to the apartment. There are also three car park garages in the nearby area.

Because of Hurricane Sandy, we left a day early to beat the storm home. Again, Dimitri helped us reload the car, this time with with my other daughters' and another son-in-law's luggage. Their flights had been cancelled. Dimitri gave us good advice and directions to get out of the area safely.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this apartment and our host, Dimitri Moderbacher!"
16326,3110920,18/12/12,3684529,Celeste,My husband and I booked Demitri's apartment for a wedding in Brooklyn.  We were meeting 2 other couples who were coming from other cities with different arrival times.  Demitri was more than accomodating to the various arrival times.  The apartment was in a great location - just minutes from a subway station and amazing restaurants.  It was very clean and we had everything we needed.  I would highly recommend staying here!
16326,3168799,28/12/12,2826697,Cecile,"Nous y sommes allé pendant les fêtes de Noel. 
Cet appartement tient ces promesses : grand, spacieux, idéal jusqu’à 8 personnes. Facile d'accès pour Manhattan (3 métros à proximité, dont le C, très rapide). Dans un quartier très sympa & typique. Tous commerces à coté. Mais surtout AU CALME! (Et c'est bien agréable de pouvoir dormir tranquillement,après les longues journées à visiter NY! ). Le seul petit bémol : les lits des 2 petites chambres sont assez dur.
En plus Dimitri et sa famille sont adorables : plein de bons conseils, avant & pendant le séjour.
Je conseil à toute personne recherchant un grand appartement,pour dormir au calme et facile d'accès pour visiter! "
16326,3508749,10/2/13,2134085,Laura,"A wonderful 2 week stay in a proper Brooklyn apartments. The house itself was perfectly suited for our needs - located in a great area, very close amenities, warm and inviting. Dimitri was a perfect host and we couldn't ask for anything more.

16326,3814101,18/3/13,4418025,Jonathan,"10 días inolvidables en NY. Nos hospedamos 7 personas. Apartamento muy limpio, amplio, cómodo y bien comunicado con el metro. Dimitri es una persona muy amable y colaboradora, nos ayudo en todas las peticiones que hicimos e hizo nuestra estancia muy agradable. Totalmente recomendable el hospedarse en este apartamento, en un barrio muy tranquilo y seguro tanto de día como de noche. Mis amigos y yo quedamos encantados y tenemos claro que volveremos a NY y volveremos a este apartamento!!"
16326,4017541,3/4/13,3596050,Harald,"Beside the fact that I would recommend this appartment to everyone (I'm actually already recommended it to my closest friends) there's not much to add really. Dimitri is a great host, helpful, kind, reachable at any time. The appt fits for everybody, wether you're with babies (like we were) or just a bunch of friends, it's just great! The neigbourhood is super! Everything you need is at walking distance. There's not one bad thing we can think of regarding our experience here. If we're going back one day, we know our place to stay!"

16326,4211407,19/4/13,3074707,Jeff,"Dimitri was awesome to work with, the apartment was great, and the area was perfect. We went to Brooklyn for a week to visit with family and stayed in the apartment with our 4 year old and 2 year old. The apartment itself was great, it's better then the pictures . The area itself is surrounded with brownstones and playgrounds. We used the playground across the street, walked to prospect park, visited the zoo.. it was fantastic.

We had a car and finding parking in the area was actually really simple, I was worried I would need to park a mile away but each time I easily found street parking within a block of the apartment.

The area is filled with restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores within a few blocks. 

If we go back to Brooklyn , we will absolutely stay at the apartment again.. it was just perfect for our family. "
16326,4333535,29/4/13,4573239,Alain Et Elisabeth,"Really nice and clean flat. Household appliances easy to use and modern. With 4 real bedrooms allowing to accommodate 8 people with comfort. The neighborhood is really nice and quiet, next to Prospect park. Dimitri is very nice, welcoming and always ready to help."

L'appartement est très agréable, spacieux, silencieux (rare à NY), équipé avec tout ce qu'il faut, idéalement situé (magasins, parc et 3 lignes de metro directs pour Manhattan). En outre, Dimitri est un hôte très attentionné. C'est un bon plan !!!!!"
16326,4645172,18/5/13,8934,Sandra,"Dimitri was a very nice host. The flat is very nice and clean. It was really nice to come back to brooklyn and to find peace and quite in that nice area after all the excitement but also the noise of Manhattan.
I will definately recommend this flat to anyone. It is very spacious. The area is very nice with parks, a baggel shop, a supermarket, a whine shop and a deli just around the corner. We very easily felt like home."
16326,4783008,26/5/13,4544144,Brigitte,"Staying with Dimitri was really great! He and his bother live in the same house, that is why they are always ready to help you if a problem occurs. The apartment provides you with everything you need and is comfortable for up to 6 persons, one room has no windows which might not suit everyone. The two bedrooms facing the yard are very quiet and in the morning the cackling hens may wake you up. It was my second time in New York and I loved staying in Brooklyn in contrast to Manhattan.
A big plus for German speaking guests: Dimitri is Austrian and speaks the language perfectly!"
16326,4898814,1/6/13,4714370,Agnès,"We had a very nice stay in Dimitri's great apartment.
The apartment was exactly as described, with four separated bedrooms and a large living room, nice kitchen, two bathrooms.
The apartment was perfectly clean, with everything needed. Really feel like home !
The neighborhood was nice and quiet, 5-10 min walk from de closest subway station, with restaurants, bars, supermarket.
Dimitri was very nice and gentle, giving good advices, booking our taxi to go back to the airport.
I would definitly recommend his apartment, me and my family really enjoyed our stay here."

Our 8 day stay in Brooklyn at Dimitri's apartment was wonderful.  So many reasons why....we wanted for nothing...all amenities were there as well as a host who was friendly, fun and always willing to assist. Great location, easy to get around and many restaurants, supermarkets, laundry's etc. just around the corner. We had a wonderful stay and can't recommend it highly enough.  All of us would be back in a (Website hidden by Airbnb) Power ball! Thanks Dimitri & family...see you again one day, we hope, if not, there's always a very long flight to where we are!  xx"

Nous sommes partis à 7 (5 adultes et 2 enfants) et nous ne nous sommes pas sentis à l'étroit , la taille des chambres est correcte. La cuisine est complète et très fonctionnelle. L'appartement est bien entretenu et propre.
Le quartier est agréable et idéal pour se reposer après avoir passé la journée dans la foule et le bruit de Manhattan . Le métro est à 10 min à pied.

Dimitri est un hôte attentionné et très serviable.
Je recommande cet appartement et y retournerais volontiers si l'occasion se présentait."
16326,6652210,20/8/13,5177213,David,"I've recently returned from New York having hired Dimitri's apartment for 7 nights in a group of 8. To cut to the chase, the apartment is fantastic and Dimitri nothing short of a true gent. 

We were in the city for a wedding but also had plenty of time to see some sights and do some socialising, with easy access to the subway stations at Grand Army Plaza and 7th it's easy to get to most places without fuss. Locally, the bagels and burritos available on Vanderbilt, one street across, are first class. Nice short walks through sleepy brownstone streets take you to 5th where you can experience the myriad pleasures of Park Slope and beyond. Also, really quick to Coney Island, which was a bonus. 

The apartment is spacious, clean, with good facilities and a friendly face if you need any help with anything, I can't recommend heartily enough. Get away fro the hubbub of Manhattan and come stay here! Thanks again from the 8 of us."
16326,7324478,16/9/13,5580351,Rob,"I’d like to start by saying that Dimitri was a terrific host.  He was a great communicator, answered all our questions in a timely manner and was very thorough in his responses.   He went above and beyond by sending us directions to give to our taxi driver from both JFK and LaGuardia.  He was also kind enough to let us check in early and to check out a bit later as all of us had different departure times.  NICE!  The apartment was great!  We were in town for my daughter’s wedding and we had PEOPLE.  Wound up maxing out the apartment with 8 people and it worked out great.  The apartment was very nice, 2nd floor with Dimitri above us on the 3rd floor and I believe his brother on the first floor.  The apartment was quiet, the bathrooms were nice and clean with lots of linens and there was plenty of hot water too.  The kitchen was well supplied (yup, a dishwasher) and clean.  Pretty much everything you needed.  Location wise, it was perfect.  Go out the front door and immediately to the left was a corner shop.  Need milk, done.  A toothbrush, done.  A sandwich, done.  Etc. Etc. Two blocks away there was a bagel shop.  Fresh bagels, yumm.  There was a market there also and a breakfast sandwich shop too.  Subway was about two blocks away.  I didn’t use the subway but my sons did and they said it was easy peasy.  If you have young children there is a playground right across the street from the apartment.   Dimitri also gave us the number of a car service (Evelyn) and that worked out super.  My transportation recommendation….leave the car at home and use the subway and car service.  Yes, the car service is a bit expensive but there is the subway too.  I think there was a parking garage on the same street but didn’t really look into it.  Street parking was between slim and none and I think it may be restricted to residents with tags.  Guess you’d have to ask Dimitri about that.  I would and will recommend Dimitri to anyone visiting NYC/Brooklyn area and especially if you have a big crew with you.  Thanks Dimitri!"
16326,7574775,25/9/13,5777906,Tita,"Dimitri Moderbacher is an excellent host.  Our flight arrived at 11:20 PM and Dimitri's  greeting was so welcoming and warm, he provided us with lots of information about neighborhood as well as transportation. The apartment is well kept and very roomy, you will not be disappointed.  I promise you will love it. 
Easy access to subways and public buses (20 min ride to Manhattan).  Very cute upcoming neighborhood with great food, local bars and parks if you are traveling with kids.   
I would book again in a heart beat.   "

Only 20mn to Manhattan by Q line, we will certainly come back here during our next journey to NYC. Thank's for all Dimitri."

house, a very detailed description of the apartment in a beautiful Brooklyn neighbourhood including

pictures, the direction from the subway to Manhattan, recommendations for restaurants, jazz clubs....

The apartment was very spacious and well equipped, clean, quiet and light – just perfect for our one week stay in NY!

16326,8637303,10/11/13,8526002,Jenny,"Lägenheten var rymlig och fräsch. Dimitri var en jättetrevlig värd. Han var väldigt hjälpsam. En av oss skulle springa maraton så han hjälpte oss med transport och tips kring detta. När vi skulle åka hem kunde vi lämna väskorna efter att vi checkat ut för att hämta dom senare på dagen. Området är lugnt och trevlig, närmsta tunnelbana är 2 kvarter bort. Det tog ca 20 min in till Manhattan."

We definitively enjoyed staying in such a location; first of all, Dimitri is a warm host; he gave us a lot of information and advice before our arrival and welcome us to ensure we will be ""at home"" in his apartment. Dimitri propose some sleeping arrangements to make our trip more confortable. The apartment was very clean and  was as described, functional & comfortable and very quiet!
The location in Brooklyn is nice as in the mean time  we were  less than 10' by walk to the subway station for Manhattan and there are a lot to do/visit in Brooklyn aswell . All the shops for daily needs are at one block from the flat (5' by walk).
We definitively recommend this apartment and his host!

Dimitri es muy agradable y adicionalmente a la información que nos proporcionó a la llegada (transportes, restaurantes, eventos...) nos facilitó la partida (tarjetas de embarque, taxi al aeropuerto).
En resumen un muy buen sitio para pasar unos dia/semanas en NY y un estupendo anfitrión que te orienta y facilita las cosas.

L'appartement était spacieux, nous étions 8 la première moitié du séjour et 6 l'autre moitié. Très propre et très bien équipé il ne manquait rien, on s'est senti comme à la maison, l'endroit idéal pour se relaxer après des journées à arpenter les rues de new york. 

Le quartier est sympa avec des commerces, bars, restaurants à proximité. Le métro est à 10 minutes à pied dans des rue  arborées et bordées de jolies petites maisons.  

On recommande cet appartement et y retournerons avec plaisir."
16326,15816944,16/7/14,14658647,Barbara,"We had a wonderful time staying at this apartment. Dimitri is an amazing, attentive host - he is so friendly and welcoming, and provides an abundance of helpful information; we felt safe and cared for, knowing he was nearby and only a text away with answers! The apartment itself is in pristine condition. The rooms are spotless and updated and everything is in great working order. We felt perfectly comfortable walking around in our bare feet because it was so clean :). We had five adults in the apartment, and there was plenty of room. The living room is very comfortable, with plenty of room to relax and watch the World Cup, and the dining area seats 6 - quite rare in a NYC apartment! The two back bedrooms are spacious and well appointed. The front bedroom is smaller, but still had plenty of room for our clothes. The fourth bedroom would be best in cooler weather, because it is the only room without an air conditioner (no window, so not possible); it does have two fans, so Dimitri has made sure this littler room is as comfortable as possible anyway. The bathrooms are in perfect condition and the water pressure is great. The kitchen is modern and has everything you might need.
It is a lovely, tree-lined, quiet, safe neighborhood, with a little grocery next door. There are many restaurants and groceries, etc. within a few blocks, and there are several subway lines within a few blocks as well. It takes only about 20 minutes to get into Manhattan from these lines, so it is a great choice with a great host and a lot of comfortable space at a much better price than staying in Manhattan. "
16326,17552097,14/8/14,7501745,Chiara,"We were 8 people, 2 families of 4, and had a great time in Dimitri's house. The apartment is very spacious and nice, well equipped and clean. The neihborough is perfect for tourists who want to taste the flavor of local life, and close to subway and supermarkets.
Dimitri was extremely kind and and friendly. I definitely advice this place to big families or groups of two families."
16326,18134530,22/8/14,19273847,Lesa,"Dimitri's apartment was perfect for our stay in New York as a family of four. It was roughly half an hour's taxi ride from JFK, and when we arrived we were met by our host and given a few pointers on where the local subway was (there were two stations nearby both of which took you into central Manhattan) and where the local shops were (The Olde Bagel shop was a particular favourite of ours, but there were numerous places to eat out or buy food to bring back within a short walk.) The area itself was very quiet which was perfect once you have spent a long day walking round sight seeing on the main island, but also had good connections to the south of Brooklyn, which meant that Coney Island beach was also easily accessible for a quieter day relaxing on the beach. 
The apartment was exactly as described with four bedrooms, two bathrooms, a fully equipped kitchen and a living room with a seperate dining area to eat. Dimitri lives in the apartment upstairs so is always available if you need him - we found him to be an excellent host, and would absolutely stay here again. "
16326,18629399,29/8/14,19714116,Adrien,"Great trip! Dimitri is a wonderful host, very welcoming, easy to talk to and organised.
The apartment is as it's said. Spacious, modern and clean.
The neighborhood is like Brooklyn is: a melting-pot with an open spirit. It's safe with good access to the subway. You can find café, restaurants, bars one bloc from the apartment.
If I plane a new trip to NYC I would contact Dimitri with no hesitation.

Thank you again Dimitri for this great week!


Superbe séjour! Dimitri est un hôte adorable et très accueillant. Il est disponible et bien organisé.
L'appartement correspond parfaitement à la description, les chambres sont spacieuses, l'ensemble très lumineux et surtout moderne et bien entretenu.

Si je devais revenir à NYC, je recontacterai Dimitri sans hésiter.
Je vous le conseil vivement!"
16326,19115550,7/9/14,12235243,Brian,Dimitri is a very nice guy and host. Me and the group had a very good week in the appartment. It's a nice neighborhood and the 'Deli' downstairs is fantastic!
16326,20133954,24/9/14,14312558,Karel,An excellent apartment in a nice neighborhood of Brooklyn. Close to a few subway stations that will bring you quickly to Manhattan and other interesting places. Dimitri is a fantastic and sympathetic host who gives you a lot of helpful information. We were with a group of six friends and we all enjoyed our stay at Dimitri's apartment. You have our recommendation. (we think that musicians are better hosts ;-)
16326,20742462,5/10/14,18645176,Angie,"We really loved this apartment. It was immaculate, spacious (we were a group of 6 people) and had everything and more than we needed. It actually looks better than on the photos. Dimitri is a great host and is available to answer any questions. We were there to go sightseeing in NYC and it was convenient to use the metro and come back at night to a quiet and nice neighborhood with lots of possibilities to eat out. But the apartment has a fully equipped kitchen there too.
"
16326,21274538,14/10/14,10169592,Graham,"There was a group of 7 of us staying at Dimitri's place and we couldn't be happier with our experience.  The place is a great space and had enough room for all of us and our luggage for the week.  The pictures are completely accurate, and the place is spotless!  We all arrived at various times and Dimitri was there to welcome the first group (which included myself and two others) as soon as we arrived.  After dealing with a taxi driver, that took me for a nice long ride around the city, he showed us around the apartment and ran through all the details to make our stay comfortable.  Once all of us arrived Dimitri did check in with us to make sure everything was all good.  There is ""the binder"" that has maps to places around Brooklyn for seeing and eating.  It also shows where all the subway stations are near the apartment (there are three of them all within a 5 minute walk).  Getting into the city is quick and with three stations so close you are always able to find a way back at the end of the night.

The neighbourhood is so quiet at all times of day, so if you're out all night there won't be much noise to wake you up early in the day.  There are tons of restaurants within walking distance and can cater towards any cravings you might have.  There are also a few delis and grocery stores within walking distance to grab supplies to make your own meals.

If we ever make it back to NYC we will definitely be checking to see if we can get back in to Dimitri's place as it was a great value for money and the perfect place to stay for a holiday."

The street is fairly quiet, and the building is very safe.  Metro stops are less than 10 min walk. We had 5 people in the party, and there was plenty of room. We would stay there again!

Dimitri is the perfect host! He was always available for us during and before this week, he gave us a lot of great places for brunch, dinner, supermarkets and other activities.

We have stayed in a number of airbnb apartments in Brooklyn now and this stands out as the best.  You can't tell it from the photos but it is by far the most comfortable and was to live with. 

The things that make this place great are all things you might take for granted but many of the alternatives do not have them.  They are:

1. a thermostat
2. rugs - making the place cosier and quieter
3. a fully equipped kitchen - including dishwasher, and all the little things that make cooking easy.
4. It is set up for short term lets with maps / guides / menus galore.

Dimitri was a great host - friendly and accessible.  We left a couple of bits behind and Dimitri made sure they were returned to us.

This is a great neighbourhood.   We had small children with us and there is the most amazing playground I've ever seen right across the road.  It is packed with donated push along toys / water tables / plastic kitchens and has equipment for younger and older children - so much fun.  It's also near the museum, library, gardens and B/Q lines which are fast (relatively)."
16326,28377628,23/3/15,24094284,Fiorella,"L'accoglienza al nostro arrivo da parte del nostro host e' stata molto cordiale con dettagliate informazioni sulla casa e i dintorni. L'appartamento rispecchiava  la descrizione ed era molto accogliente, pulito e fornito di tutto per cui il nostro soggiorno e' stato molto piacevole. Il quartiere tranquillo e caratteristico con un grande parco vicino e due fermate della subway comode."
16326,29809691,13/4/15,20454073,Warwick,"This was a great apartment in a great location.  I stayed here with my wife and 3 teenage boys and it was very roomy and comfortable.  Dimitri stayed in constant contact with us in the lead up to our visit and although away when we arrived arranged someone to let us in and show us around.  He also had lots of documentation and maps, menus etc put together which made it easy for us to plan our visit.  The apartment kitchen was very well equipped (probably one of the best we have stayed in) and in general everything was easy.  It is about 5 min walk to 2 different subway lines which get you to lower Manhattan in about 15-20 min or upper in Time Square in about 30 min.  The general area was very safe and lots of good restaurants and supermarket close. I had a couple of jogs around and was very impressed with Prospect Park which is also very close and wish I had more time to explore it.  A great place to stay and excellent host - would happily stay in this apartment again."
16326,30659117,26/4/15,1318142,Andrew,"This worked out better than we could have imagined. Dimitri was a wonderful host, there late at night when we arrived and helpful throughout our stay with tips and suggestions about how to enjoy the city. "
16326,31503026,6/5/15,15219525,Dorien,"Dimitri was een geweldige host, meteen bij aankomst voelden we ons thuis. Hij is altijd beschikbaar voor vragen en/op tips!
Super  schoon appartement met voldoende plaats voor 8 personen. Keuken is volledig uitgerust. Heerlijk om na een drukke dag thuis te komen!"
16326,34268050,7/6/15,16273165,Karin,"We and my 4 friends had a great time in Dimitri´s appartment. It was really spacious for 5 people and it was nicely furnished and perfectly clean. The kitchen was well equiped and we also enjoyed cooking there. The location is in a nice and calm area, but with only 30 min subway ride central Manhattan can be reached.
Dimitri provided us an information folder and gave us all imaginable additional info. Additionally, he was available all the time for further questions. It was a great stay and we can absolutely recommend the appartment and Dimitri as a host.
"
16326,35998141,24/6/15,26396042,Amit,"Think of a home-stay that feels just like home and a host who is there to make you feel wanted when you arrive,  ensures that you have everything to make you comfortable and responds to every query or need as soon as you've messaged...that's our experience as a family for the amazing stay we had at this apartment. If every host and apartment on Airbnb is as awesome as this, I don't think I will ever use a hotel again! Our choice of apartment was dictated by the fact that we were travelling as a large family with a toddler. The apartment has a perfect layout to give everyone enough privacy and yet there is a large living room and well equipped open kitchen whenever we wanted to spend time together. It is airy, well lit and in a very quiet residential neighbourhood. There are window air-conditioners in all the bedrooms and living room, barring the small fourth bedroom which were adequate to keep the apartment cool even on the hottest of days during our stay. The Deli in the adjacent plot as well as the children's playground across the street were super convenient as well as the fact that Dimitri had children's toys, a stroller, a baby chair as well as a crib. We couldn't have asked for a better deal with an infant in the group. In addition, Dimtri had stocked up the apartment with sufficient linen and cleaning supplies for the duration of our stay.The apartment is superbly located with everything one could need, from laundromat, supermarket and great restaurants within a short walking distance. There are several subway connections available within a 7-8 minute walk to take one where ever one wants. The beautiful Prospect Park is also a short walk away.This was our third visit to New York but the first time we stayed outside of Manhattan. My son who studies and lives in Brooklyn would always pitch for us to stay there instead and after this visit, I have seen the wisdom of doing that. One is away from the maddening pace and crowds except when one wants to engage with them and a lot of the eateries I visited in Brooklyn were much better priced and served much better food than those typically on the tourist circuit. Thank you so much Dimitri for being such a perfect host . I would recommend this apartment unreservedly to anyone, especially those travelling in a large group and/or with small children...believe me it can't get any better than this!"
16326,36849900,2/7/15,22242203,Danila,"L'accoglienza è stata molto affabile, precisa e puntuale.
La casa era stata ben descritta e tutto corrispondeva, anzi abbiamo trovato di più.
Il quartiere gradevole e ben servito."

Everything about the apartment was exactly as he described. The apartment is great and the neighbourhood is very nice and calm. We staid for a whole week and we had everything we needed and even more.
 
We were able to talked with him for a while and share experiences, he's a really nice guy. 

Thanks Dimitri for everything, we had a great time in New York!"

16326,46462769,11/9/15,22741100,Don,"Our three-generational holiday in New York was made special and wonderful thanks to Dimitri and his family. Great communication beforehand, a personal welcome and introduction to the apartment, nothing was too much trouble for Dimitri. The apartment itself is perfect - great location close to a wide variety of restaurants, the subway, Prospect Park. With everything you might need around the house thoughtfully provided, this home from home allowed us to have a wonderful family reunion and holiday whilst feeling a bit like a local, away from all the tourist traps."
16326,49313256,3/10/15,8885497,Sheila,"We really enjoyed our stay in Brooklyn (and our first Airbnb experience) in this apartment. It is large, clean, well-appointed and in a clean and safe neighborhood. We lacked nothing! Dimitri was a kind and accommodating host. Very responsive and attentive from our first contact until checkout. Highly recommend this apartment for your NYC stay."
16326,50423489,12/10/15,25178364,Thomas,"Absolut great host! Perfect apartment! Nice neighborhood! Fast access to the metro and Manhattan! We surly would give 8 stars at least! Explicit recommendation! - Weiter in deutsch: Wir waren mit unseren 5 erwachsenen Kindern für 10 Tage dort. Die Wohnung ist auch für eine solch lange Zeit perfekt! Dimitri ist ""cool"", immer zuvorkommend und hilfsbereit. Die Wohnung ist gut angebunden und es sind genügend Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in der Nähe vorhanden. 5 Minuten zur Metro und dann 20 Minuten bis Manhattan. Absolute Empfehlung!"
16326,54248574,17/11/15,45383126,Jan,"Dimitri on aivan loistava isäntä ja asunto todella toimiva. Ennen matkaa ja painkanpäällä Dimitriltä sai kaikenlaista apua, mutta mitään ei tyrkytetty. Hänen perheensä asuu seuraavassa kerroksessa ja on lähellä jos tarvitaan, mutta antaa kaiken yksityisyyden vieraille.
Tarkat ohjeet eri lentokentiltä asunnolle olivat suureksi avuksi ryhmällemme.
Meitä oli 4 henkilöä kolmessa makuuhuoneessa. Asunto toimi erittäin hyvin.
Metrolle on matkaa n. 500m ja kokonaisaika esim. Lincoln Centeriin vie tunnin."
16326,54971345,27/11/15,2889006,Matthew,What a wonderful experience!  Dimitri greeted us at the door and kindly showed us around.  We found the place to be perfect!  Great Brooklyn neighborhood. Close to great restaurants and the subway.  We really had a wonderful experience. Dimitri and the apartment were absolutely fantastic!  
16326,55721489,5/12/15,45584844,Pieter,"After a long flight and good directions to Dimitri's apartment, it was nice to meet Dimitri early the day. He made us comfortable feeling in his apartment, and after a shower we head out to town. The apartment is close enough to the Metro and met what we were looking for. We spent a wonderful time in Brooklyn and New York City. The area is safe and we had a lot of fun jogging around the close by park and nice pedestrian roads. Thumps up for Dimitri and I would highly recommends his apartment for a good time in and around the big apple."

16326,61556532,6/2/16,50985069,Brendan,"Dimitri's Brooklyn spacious apartment is well situated for exploring both Brooklyn and Manhattan using only public transport. As a host, Dimitri can't be faulted, the apartment was well stocked with everything you need and Dimitri was an attentive host when needed without being intrusive.  I'd recommend this apartment for anyone looking to explore NY on a reasonably modest budget for a few days."
16326,66972602,26/3/16,28490785,Beatriz,"La casa es muy cómoda, está situada en un barrio tranquilo y residencial, y bien comunicada con Manhattan. La ropa de la casa es agradable, está limpia y dispone de todo lo necesario para sentirte cómodo y como en tu propia casa."
16326,69945262,15/4/16,29607711,Marie,"Nous étions deux familles françaises avec ados, avides de découvrir New York. L'appartement de Dimitri s'est révélé être l'endroit idéal pour se poser après des heures et des kilomètres de marche ! Nous nous sommes sentis comme à la maison : quartier à la fois calme et vivant avec école, jardin d'enfants, commerces pour se ravitailler et le métro à 10 minutes, appartement spacieux (nous étions 8), très propre et hyper calme (pas un bruit la nuit) très appréciable après l'effervescence de Manhattan ! Dimitri s'est montré extrêmement attentif, gentil et amical, proposant son aide à plusieurs reprises (pour récupérer un passeport oublié dans un taxi ou réserver les taxis pour notre départ) ... et c'est avec un pincement au cœur que nous l'avons quitté à la fin d'un séjour extraordinaire et inoubliable."

L'appartement est vaste, confortable, très propre, très bien équipé, en tous points conforme à la description donnée par le site Airbnb.
Dimitri est très sympathique, attentif à nos demandes et plein de ressources (restaurants, taxis, spectacles....).
Il est tout à fait adapté à une famille de 8 personnes: 3 couples (parents et enfants) et 2 petites filles.
Avons apprécié les espaces communs (cuisine, salon, salle à manger) , les 4 chambres et les 2 salles de bains."

"
16326,81938358,25/6/16,19549345,Caroline,Easy access from JFK and easy commute to Manhattan. The flat is spacious enough for 8  people. Brooklyn is definitely worth exploring on its own. Dimitri has been very accomodative with our arrival and departure schedule. The flat looks excatly like the pictures. Air con in each room was very pleasant in June ! Very good value flat.

The temperature inside apartment was perfect (even in June/July), also tnx to coolers inside.
We felt very confortable with Dimitri since he replied to all our emails before going to US and was very kindly at our arrival.
Excellent arrangment for warm welcoming, helping, and precious indications.
It was a pleasure to stay there and meet him. See you next time! ;)"

We were looking for a place large enough to be comfortable for our family, yet close enough to the city to be able to sightsee and we definitely found it! This residence was clean, comfortable, and and a short walk to two different subway stations! Dimitri was such an attentive host. As soon as we booked, he contacted us with additional information and offered his assistance with questions regarding transportation to and from the airport. Additionally, we had multiple different people coming and going, which Dimitri provided us new sheets and towels for incoming friends/family. He made himself available to answer questions about food and sightseeing. I really can't say enough positive things about the residence itself and the service we received! I would highly recommend this place! On behalf of my friends and family, thank you Dimitri for making our stay so easy and enjoyable! "
16326,90371658,31/7/16,40673048,Erik,Our first Airbnb-experience and immediately a perfect one. A great apartment and Dimitri is a great guy. All was as expected and promised. Subway stations within walking distance for easy visits to NYC. Nice neighborhood.
16326,92494514,8/8/16,44666271,Jennifer,"Unfortunately, Dimitri was on vacation during our stay, but he maintained contact with us even from overseas, and his brother Nikolai was equally accommodating.  We were four adult couples in Brooklyn for our oldest daughter's wedding, so this place was perfect.  Dimitri had supplied us in advance with a volume of information about the area, including a map with all the restaurants within walking distance, sights to see, music venues, etc.  There was an ample supply of everything we could possibly need, and plenty of room to socialize with family.  The only (minor) complaint was that the fourth bedroom doesn't have a window (so no direct air conditioning), but it does have a ceiling fan and additional desk top fan . . . and most weeks in New York City are NOT in the 90's!  Dimitri was completely flexible with our schedules coming and going, especially for our other daughter whose flight didn't leave until evening of our last day.  If the opportunity should ever arise again, we would definitely book the same place!"

16326,107122552,9/10/16,2148379,Deborah," I've been a member with airbnb for over 4yrs and i have to say, Dimitris apartment has been our favourtie overall.  Dimitri kept in communication from the moment we booked.  We were a family of 8 adults and 1 infant and were greeted by Dimitris brother when we arrived. Dimitris apartment is exceptionally clean with just the right amount of space needed for us all.  Having 2 bathrooms made it very accessible for our group. Each of the four bedrooms was a perfect size.  We loved the lounge which overlooked the street.  The kitchen is stored with all the equipment needed for a cook in. The apartment is surrounded by beautiful brownhouses, a convenient/deli store next to the apartment which was very handy if we needed anything, a barbar next to the deli store where my sons visited and recommend, 5 minutes up the road there are a line of stores, restaurants and bakeries for an early morning coffee and the subway just 10minutes walk away.  Dimitri is very organised with a folder containing maps, closest subways, menus, restaurants etc... Any other questions you may have, Dimitri is always available to answer. He made our stay so much better by going over and above for us even organising and calling a cab when we were leaving.  You will not go wrong booking with Dimitri.  Thank you Dimitri.  Wishing you and your family all the best.  Till next time  "

16326,121902762,19/12/16,10582820,Susan,"If you're reading this, it means you're considering Dimitri's wonderful Prospect Heights rental. I would recommend that you go immediately to 'request booking' and snap this one up!

We, a multi-generational family, with members aged 2 - 85 including a son and family visiting from Singapore, rented for 4 days in mid-December 2016 and our stay here could not have been improved: 5 stars really seems inadequate. This cozy apartment is beautifully decorated, with original art work on the walls, comfortable  furniture, great beds and a terrific kitchen. We are foodies, but with a 2 year old, we ended up doing a lot of cooking in and appreciated the good cookware and cooking utensils. When we did eat out, we had lots of places to choose from and despite the foul weather during those days, we walked everywhere.  Supermarkets are nearby as are delis, espresso bars, taquerias, cocktail bars, restaurants, diners, bagel shop, pizza places - better than at home! And Dimitri was always available if we needed assistance or advice. 

The apartment is on a busy street, but no road noise can be heard inside. There is one front bedroom, but we used the back bedrooms and slept in silence. Subways and buses are close-by and taxis are easily hailed or called. For children - playground across the street, Children's Museum relatively near, and for small children, a nice selection of toys in the apartment. For adults, The Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn Academy of Music,  The Barclay Center, local jazz clubs - whatever your pleasure, Brooklyn has it and Prospect Heights has Dmitri's rental. We hope we've convinced you . You'll be astonished how quickly you'll feel at home and how seamless your visit will be.

Nous sommes arrivés à NYC à 8 tard le samedi soir : 2 couples et 4 ados. Merci à Pyeng de nous avoir accueillis :). L'appartement était parfaitement adapté à notre groupe. Le quartier est très calme et à proximité de quartiers animés. Nous avons adoré Brooklyn en particulier son superbe Prospect park où nous avons pu nous rendre à pied, nous y avons passé nos deux dimanches à observer les Brooklynites pique-niquer, jouer au base-ball ... Brooklyn Heights offre une vue magnifique sur la sky line et nous avons pu facilement aller à Manhattan et dans le Queens. Finissant notre séjour fin mai, nous avons pus aussi tester la plage de Coney Island qui venait d'ouvrir :).

We found the place clean and tidy, and fully equipped down to the last appliance; we really didn’t miss a thing. The apartment is located in a safe and quiet residential neighborhood, about 8-10 minute casual walk to the train.  Dimitri was a wonderful host from the first communication — always available, caring but not intrusive, and showed maximum flexibility during check in/out. Ideal place for a family stay. Will definitely book again!"

It is a quick walk to 2 different subway stations, which allows for easy travel into Manhattan or even out to Coney Island.  The apartment was perfect in size and had everything we needed for breakfast each day and an occasional meal in.  We had 8 people (including a 2 year old) for four of the days and then 6 people for the other three days. 
 Everything was immaculately clean and the apartment was much quieter than we anticipated, which was wonderful! Our 2 year old had space to move around and play and the playground right next door was perfect for allowing him to burn off some extra energy.  We also loved the neighborhood with a wonderful bagel place and grocery store that suited all of our needs.  Dimitri was a fantastic host who helped us get settled and offered wonderful suggestions within the neighborhood.  He went above and beyond!  I highly recommend Dimitri and the apartment, especially for families!"

16326,189690666,2/9/17,2731039,Esther,"We do not really think that Dimitri's place needs more positive evalutions as it already has more than enough. However, just in case anybody is hesitant wether or not rent this appartment, please find below a couple of comments:

A. POSITIVE POINTS
1. Dimitri answers your questions/mails almost instantly
2. Dimitri is very helpful. At your arrival, during your stay, when you leave
3. The appartment is what you see in the pictures. Spacious, well decorated, well equiped (more than expected), very comfortable (nice bedding, nice showers...) very quiet
4. There are enough supermarkets, restaurants, laundromats, etc, next to the house
5. There several lines of the subway close to house (within 10 minutes waking)

B. DRAWBACKS (to mention something)
1. The appartement is not located in Manhattan, so you will have to arrange some time to get there. However, that it is something that you will notice when you pay (way more cheap than an appartment in Manhattan)"
16326,195228275,18/9/17,7631603,Joyce,Dimitri and his great apartment are the best!
16326,197467814,25/9/17,15310247,Jim,We come to Brooklyn at least once a year for a reunion in Park Slope. We always use Air bnb. This by far was our favorite place. We will always be checking here first before searching. Close to Subways. Park. Kids playground on the corner. Deli/ little Store right there as well if you get hungry. Dimitri was great. Even carried some of our bags up the stairs.  Waited their for our baby rental equipment to be delivered. Overall a 5 star experience. If you want a 4 bedroom in Brooklyn. Look no further. That is my advice.  We stayed with our two small children. 3 and 1. And my wife's mother. This place was perfect for all. Thanks Dimitri!!!!
16326,204032491,16/10/17,11166451,Geraldine,"Dimitris apt is perfect for large groups - we were 8. Plenty of living space with great kitchen facilities and large bedrooms. It was very clean and well equipped for our 2 week stay. The apt is an easy walk to many subway lines, laundry, food markets, restaurants and shops. We felt like locals on day 2!!  Prospect Park is close also for lovely walks away from hustle and bustle. Dimitri is super friendly, helpful and chilled so it was easy to communicate with him for anything. You are staying in a family house in the middle of 3 apts so you get a nice family vibe with coming and going. We highly recommend this lovely place."
16326,207075197,28/10/17,52531382,Kim,"Dimitri's apartment suited our group really well. The apartment is even better than the photos (is bigger in reality). It is comfortable, cosy and very clean. Dimitri was really helpful- on hand if we needed anything at all. This is a really good location to stay if you want to visit New York but want to stay in a more local (less busy) area but with still lots to do nearby. It's easy to get into New York to do all the tourist things but then also a ton of bars, restaurants and other things to do nearby the apartment. I would recommend this apartment- Dimitri is a great host. If we are lucky enough to go again I would not hesitate in booking this again!"
16326,209906120,6/11/17,45882352,Anouck,"Nous revenons enchantés de notre séjour à NYC. 
Notre logement ? allez-y les yeux fermés ! 
Merci +++ à Dimitri pour son accueil, sa disponibilité et sa sympathie!
L'appartement est très bien situé, tout près du métro. Propre, cosy, fonctionnel, agréable, accueillant.
Nous y étions à deux familles (8 personnes) c'était parfait! 
A refaire !"
16326,214048916,24/11/17,149377443,Michael,"The place was amazing!  Super spacious and very close to Prospect Park, the train, and great shops and restaurants. Dimitri was an excellent host. He was so kind and responsive. We would definitely stay here again!"
16326,218427993,12/12/17,43329467,Marion,"Wir waren mit der ganzen Familie (6 Erwachsene) Anfang Dezember in Brooklyn. Dimitris Wohnung ist das beste, was uns passieren konnte. Es gibt viel Platz, der Wohnraum und die Küche sind bestens ausgestattet und es ist alles sehr sauber. Die nächste Umgebung bietet alles, was man braucht: Supermarkt, American Diner, Bagel Shop und zur nächsten Metro sind es 5 min. Dimitri ist ein sehr netter, aufmerksamer und hilfsbereiter Gastgeber, der für uns immer ansprechbar war. Nochmals lieben Dank und bis zum nächsten Mal."
16326,234008821,11/2/18,79522389,U.S. - Asia Law Institute,"Beyond all expectations.

Our organization booked Dimitri's place for 4 participants in our 3 week workshop who were coming from China.  As we regularly host such programs, and book several Airbnb places for each one, we have a lot of experience with hosts and apartments in this city.  Renting Dimitri's apartment was, without question, the best experience we've ever had with Airbnb.  Our participants absolutely loved the apartment, which for a 4-bedroom place in such a fantastic location, is incredibly well priced.  

From our end, Dimitri consistently went above and beyond to make sure everything was easy and perfect, whether in booking the place, helping us ensure that everyone arrived safely (their Chinese phones don't work in the US), or going the extra mile to accommodate our group's needs. The next time we need to book a place Dimitri will be the very top of our list of options.  

If you need a 3 or 4 bedroom place in a great part of the city with easy access to Manhattan, and a wonderfully helpful host, booking this place is simply a no-brainer."

Il est très disponible pour donner des conseils si on en a besoin. Une très bonne adresse !"

The living/dining/kitchen area was spacious, the kitchen was well equipped, all bedrooms had closets, drawers, lamps, tables, beds, etc. The apartment had nice new windows and shades, air conditioners, rugs, etc. In all, it was just great, as was the location. Near subway stations, parks, museums, restaurants. Dimitri was very pleasant in all our communications and also very helpful during our stay. We would definitely stay here again!"

16326,296306549,25/7/18,87069253,Ernesto,"Dimitri’s place in Brooklyn was great!. I visited with a group of eight, three generations, including my two kids. A lot of space and great dining and kitchen area. Rooms were comfy and lots of space for clothes and bags. The location was great, with subway station, markets and restaurants close by. Parking in the street is tricky but once you understand the street cleaning cycle then it is fine. Dimitri was available all the time and super helpful. Will definitely stay here again!"
16326,301130439,3/8/18,6218698,Elissa,"This well located apartment worked out great for our trip! We were 2 families of 4 spending a week in New York City. Dimitri even offered us an extra air mattress - which was a great help when a couple of the kids didn’t do so well sharing a double bed.
Loved the neighborhood with a good vibe and plenty of good restaurants. Pretty good proximity to several subway lines also.
Dimitri went above and beyond meeting us for check in and check out and even helping carry a suitcase up and down the flight of steps.
I would definitely stay here again!"

16338,28848,9/3/10,54286,Matthew,"I had a very pleasant stay (7 days) at Patricia's Fort Greene place.  She is very kind, helpful and accomodating, even offering me a free pass to the AMoNH.  I have no complaints whatsoever and highly recommend this room to anyone (I would disagree with the previous review with regard to size; I stayed by myself but strongly believe the room is large enough to accomodate couples with ease).  Great neighborhood and great stay!  "

The area is quiet, safe with beautiful old brownstone buildings and fabulous places to eat and shop. Trish is a perfect host. She is very reliable and was always helpful when I had questions.

16338,21887149,26/10/14,17716253,Brian,Fantastic room in awesome neighborhood with private balcony overlooking a quiet courtyard.  I came to New York for a very busy work week and this was a wonderful oasis in the city for when the day was done. Super close to the G and C train. Close to restaurants and groceries. Patricia was an awesome host. I would definitely come back next time I'm in town. My only regret is that I didn't have more time to hang out on the balcony. 
16338,23293585,28/11/14,9567539,Hannah,Patricia is the most amazing host! The room is so lovely and the outside deck great. One of the best airbnbs I've ever stayed in - would defnitely recommend!

16338,23943171,15/12/14,2584452,Lindsay,"My couple day stay at Patricia's was the best. Located in one of my favorite neighborhoods of Brooklyn, the apartment is right down the street from the subway, and around many delicious restaurants. The room itself was incredible. So spacious, comfy, and if it had been a tad bit warmer out I would have fully enjoyed the patio. Patricia, herself, is absolutely lovely as well. I was barely around, but the times we did chat I fully enjoyed it. She made me feel welcome the entire time. "
16338,24935304,4/1/15,16458802,Mickaël,The room was nice and quiet and we enjoyed our stay in Patricia's flat. She is considerate and respects her hosts' privacy while giving advices on the city.

Elle m'a tout de suite donné le double des clefs et je me suis très vite senti comme chez moi. Elle respecte l'intimité de ses hôtes et donne pleins de bons conseils.
L'appartement est très bien, la chambre est grande. Elle dispose d'un petit fauteuil et d'une petite commode pour ranger ses affaires. Patricia met à disposition un placard dans la cuisine et un étage dans le frigo. La terrasse est appréciable, le quartier vachement sympa et plutôt vivant (ça doit l'être encore plus en été). Manhattan est très facile d'accès, en moins de 20 minutes. "
16338,28646267,28/3/15,23174164,Julia,"II was my first experience to find a place in Airnbnb site and in NY as well. And I am so happy that I had a chance to stay in Patricia' place. She was so helpful, easy going and friendly. I was appreciated her advice to make my staying comfortable. I even had a great chance to enjoy some local events with her and her friends. Regarding the room and the area - I loved it. The area was very safe and queit. It was close to everything and just 2-3 stops by expess train to manhattan midtown. There were cool bars just near by, good supermarkets and the parks. The room was pretty comfortable and spacious. It is my best experience and I wish I could come to stay with Patricia again. "
16338,29623069,10/4/15,29229924,Michael,"I enjoyed the cozy and quiet room,

placed in a friendly neighborhood,
with a very nice host.
I have had to feel fine there!

16338,38498933,16/7/15,1822945,Péter,"I spent a few weeks at Patricia's, it was all good. The room was spacious, bigger than average in New York.  Easy walk to Dumbo and the other close neighbourhoods with loads of restaurants. Thanks! :)"
16338,40308732,30/7/15,29330461,Sara,"I stayed with Trish for two weeks in July and i must say it was great! The room was big and nicely decorated. There was a bed in the floor which i preferred and it was quite comfortable. The deck was nice but a little dusty, so i didn't spent to much time there, although i must say it is perfect in the morning for having breakfast. The shared bathroom and kitchen were clean. The kitchen has all you could need to cook and Trish left some space in the cupboards and fridge for me. Also she provided towels and left a big closet in the corridor for me to use. There is a fan in the room which was great for the hot summer nights.
The neighbourhood was quiet and i found the houses and buildings nearby charming, it's a nice place (not at all scary even at night) and the building is a 5 min walk from the subway and 25-30 min ride to manhattan. It is an old building without an elevator but you only need to go up one floor. There were some restaurants and grocery shops nearby.
Overall Trish was a great host! She was really nice with me during my stay. We didn't get to talk much because i was out a lot but when we did she was really helpful and easy to talk to. During my stay i lost the keys to the apartment which made me really nervous and she kindly gave me another set.
I would highly recomend staying with Trish!"
16338,47697178,21/9/15,20890694,Margarita,"I've enjoyed staying at Patricia. She is a kind, warm person, and she respects privacy at the same time.

The location is great, close to the subway and restaurants.

The apartment has a lot of character and the room had loads of space with a very powerful fan for those warm nights. 
The location is perfect being a 5-10 minute walk from the bars/pubs with great DJ's plus restaurants/diners and the best little grocery store I've ever been in!
Patricia was a great host and told me all the best places to go which made life nice and easy! She was very approachable and chatty but also gave me space. "

Two subway lines are walkable from her place (re looking a simple, budget friendly place in brooklyn, this apt is a good deal!"
16338,198808183,30/9/17,23901,Chloe,"Trish and her place are amazing. Trish was warm, friendly and very easygoing.  The room is much bigger than I expected, tastefully and helpfully furnished( there is now a real bed in the room which was a great surprise) it is quiet, green surroundings, and as the bedrooms are on opposite sides of the apartment we didn’t disturb each other with our different schedules. I would definitely stay here again. 

A great place in a great location."
16421,21642,28/12/09,64655,Stéphanie,"Great location, really near Time Square and the subway;Mark is also really nice and helpful;the only downside for me was the too hot heating which couldn't be lowered."
16421,41422,10/5/10,104578,Pamela,"A pleasant tho small apartment, in an extremely convenient location. Mark was pleasant and a kind person,  but he did not appear to view letting a room to me as a business and I was a valued customer.  Rather, I felt I had to fit in with Marks life and routines and think it should have been around the other way.... 
The apartment has great garden area to have meals outside, but in the colder weather in the small iving area, there is nowhere to sit down to eat at a table. Not a huge problem I guess.  However, the breakfast as such was less than what I would have appreciated, being  offered onl7y muffins and jam and only herbal teas if one did not wish for coffee.  I think Mark needs to  provide at least another choice --healthy cereal and fruit if wished.  I purchased these for myself.  I appreciated having use of the kitchen and upon asking Mark was OK for me to watch the TV for news etc.  In view of the fact that there is only one bathroom it is important and would be more considerate if each person used the bathroom for a shorter period of time to allow for others to access it. Also, it Marks occasional flat mate is using the second bedroom he really should not book people to stay and then put them into his bedroom --  which is what happened to me; I not only felt that I was encroaching on his space, but it did not feel like a room I had paid over $100 per night for!  During this time Mark had to sleep on the floor in the living room and I did not enjoy having to walk past his makeshift bed with him on it, during the night,  scarcely covered by a sheet. This was the arrangement for five of my ten nights there....  All this got sorted and Mark was only too willing to hear my feedback on my stay.  Overall, I would rate value for money 5 out of ten.  Mark just needs to sharpen up his ""host role"" and put his ""renters"""" first... "
16421,57438,26/6/10,135788,Christopher,"Mark was very hospitable. The weather was unusually hot and humid for NYC in June. Mark had an AC in the room. The area is very convenient. Close to subway station. Most major places from Greenwich Village to Central Park are only 20 minute walks from Mark's apartment. Thanks Mark. 
"
16421,90664,5/9/10,183947,Utku,"great location, really close to times square maybe 3 minutes walking from house to times square. Inside the house it's really cozy, perfect backyard and Mark was a great and helpful host to me. I would totally recommend this house to the other people who wants to have a great stay in NYC. Thanks a lot Mark."
16421,114195,8/10/10,226365,Peimin,"the location of Mark's apartment was great, and my husband and i really enjoyed the convenience to times square and broadway, though in the apartment we often felt like we were intruding. 

i am really saddened by some misunderstanding Mark had of us. about 2 months after our stay, i received a review from Mark implying that we stole his passport. this is a shock to me, and is the first time i am reading about the passport. if he truly believed i stole from him, he did not email me to check if i have it and i am also not sure if he made a police report or take any legal action against me. i feel really awful for being accused of stealing someone's passport. this accusation may come back to haunt me and my husband, and it's really unfair to us."
16421,141231,18/11/10,279704,Mark,Absolutely wonderful...I returned!  Thanks Mark for great hospitality.
16421,141856,20/11/10,279704,Mark,"Mark is a very welcoming host.  He gives you your space while always being there when you need him.  Very clean and comfortable surroundings. Excellent location close to restaurants, bars and theatres.  I would stay again in a heartbeat."
16421,145407,28/11/10,3587,Jonathan,Mark was very accomadating.  We were able to come and go with ease throughout the week.  The location and price of this apartment is unbeatable!

The location of his house just two minutes walking to Times Square. We recommended this host to everyone who want to spent time in big Apple.
16421,177603,2/2/11,328190,Pier,"Mark is an excellent host, a rich source of advice on shopping, sightseeing, or things to do, yet very unassuming. The accommodation is nice and clean and organized, with good storage available. The location is the best anyone can hope for. While here, you are pretty much in subway heaven, with clear shots to all of Manhattan and the outer boroughs. A GREAT value. Thank you."
16421,199937,15/3/11,130668,Rachel,Mark's apartment is a great place to stay. Mark is a great host and made sure I had everything I needed. The apt is nicely decorated with great attention to detail. Comfortable bed. Great location-near Everything.
16421,222847,11/4/11,240697,Graham,"Mark's apartment is more than excellent, he could not of made us feel any more welcome. The location is excellent, literally 10 mins walk to Time Square and all major subways. There are a lot of fine restaurants and bars in surrounding streets, specially 46th street. 
With all this vibrant life around you, you would expect its not quiet to relax after your busy day but Mark's apartment is perfect for this before making your next trip out. If you after a central location in Manhattan this is certainly the place to stay, I can highly recommend it and defiantly will be asking to stay again. Thanks Mark for your kind hospitality. -  Graham & Mike"
16421,229484,18/4/11,101742,Janice,"Mark was a great, accommodatng host, providing a clean room in a beautiful apt with exposed brick & a large patio & wonderfully decorated with panache.  And location, location, location!!!  Less than 5-10 minute walk from the 42nd St subway hub and the heart of Times Square.  Tons of any kind of cuisine, shops, pharmacies, banks & food carts in all directions right out the door!! 15 min. walk to Central Park. And on & on...If I could I'd be back tomorrow in a New York minute"
16421,236641,23/4/11,469924,Marie,"Arriving at Mark's is like arriving at your friend's, He's waiting for your arrival, He takes the time to make sure you have everything you need for your stay. The apartment is extremely comfortable and nicely decorated.
Then you discover all the very kind attentions he had for you everywhere in the apartment. You feel  really like home when arriving after a big day visiting, The weather wasn't friendly enough so that will could enjoy the quiet garden. We really had a great time and Mark is a remarquable host!
He can be sure we will come back! "
16421,245010,30/4/11,349321,Reinhild,Mark is very friendly and helpfull and a nice host. But unfortunately he must be because during our time his toilet does not work which had very unpleasant consequences for us so that we had  i.e. to go to Starbucks to use their restrooms. That was the inconvenience what we disliked most. Not so important: the place at a whole was a bit untidy. 
16421,260285,11/5/11,576644,Carol,The host canceled my reservation 41 days before arrival.
16421,273421,21/5/11,474424,Esther,"I stayed in Marks place with two friends for six nights and it was a really good experience. The location couldn't have been better. It is very close to the theater district and times square but amazingly enough it's at the same time a nice and quiet place. Around the corner on 9th ave you will find some nice restaurants and the subway is very close as well. Marks place is very nicely decorated with asian influences. There are two small bedrooms, one with a double bed and one with a single bed (since we're from holland (tall people) the double bed was a bit too short for my two friends). Mark is a very nice and welcoming person. He gave us a good tip for an excellent thai restaurant around the corner. I would recommend staying at this heaven in hells kitchen to everyone! "
16421,341072,28/6/11,61341,Anne,"I am a seasoned Airbnb-er. I love using the site to travel. 
This summer I am experiencing NYC for an extended period of time. I am staying all over the city to get a feel for different neighborhoods. 
Staying at Mark's apartment was fantastic. He is the best host. 
I enjoy personal space, writing and quiet time; Mark gives you space, is not invasive, and is always available to answer questions. 
His recommendations of places to visit and eat are perfect. 
Mark and the location of his apartment are at the best for visiting anything in NYC. Their are Subway lines VERY close (visit Harlem or Downtown). However, most things you can walk to. 
As for the apt. WOW. I enjoy spaces that reflect the tenant takes care of their space. It shows pride of space and the home. Mark has great taste in art and a good eye for color schemes. By far, Mark has the nicest kitchen I've seen in NYC (I've visited NYC more than 15 times). It is clean, complimentary lighting and beautifully decorated. The bathroom is also very clean and well decorated. 
However, the pièce de resistance is the patio. Mark's outdoor space is one of the MOST desirable and coveted spaces to have in Manhattan. The amount of work Mark has taken into creating a personal sanctuary in the city, shows his devotion to having nice things. I loved waking up and enjoying my coffee and breakfast outside. It is very relaxing compared to what is just down the street (Times Square).
I love Mark's apartment. 
I plan on returning with my boyfriend and attending some Broadway shows later this year; I plan on returning to Mark's!
Thank you Mark for a wonderful NYC experience!! "
16421,361079,8/7/11,754875,Nieves,"Very well located, only 1.5 blocks away from Times Square. It is also very conviniently located from the Subway, only half a block from the line that takes you to JFK airport.
The appartment is nice, nothing fancy but has everything you need for a few days stay, including air conditioning. The room is small and basic but enough, and the bathroom is clean.
I had a great stay there!"
16421,378016,17/7/11,679490,Glenda,"Charming apartment; an oasis of beauty in the midst of the bustling, centrally located Hell's Kitchen/;Theater district.  Mark is a wonderful host -- friendly and helpful.  I was there in high summer and the apartment was comfortable and cool enough.  Garden is GREAT for sipping coffee and listening to all the sounds of the neighborhood.  I'll definitely contact airbnb and see if I can get the same apartment when I return to NYC!"
16421,408056,31/7/11,545858,Rex,"Mark's place is the place to be if you want to be where the action is.  Conveniently located to sights and transportation.  Mark is a friendly chap and a kind hearted soul.  He'll look after your needs or let you fly solo.  His place is an oasis among the crowds.  I look forward to returning one day and highly recommend Mark's place when staying in New York City.

Es fácil compartir vivienda con él, su hogar es silencioso y tranquilo, tiene un jardin precioso.
Sin duda alguna pensamos volver a visitarlo cuando volvamos a Nueva York.

16421,689058,3/11/11,1096128,Sanja,"Mark's ""Heaven in hells kitchen"" truly lived up to it's name. The apartment was just right, clean, comfortable and convenient. Mark was the best host anyone could wish for. With his generosity, helpful advice and general pleasantness, he made us feel very much wanted and at home. And the location? Two minute walk to Times Square! Very safe neighborhood, close to the major transport hubs (subway, bus, train), so it's easy to move between the apartment and the airports in a short time, as well as getting to every corner of Manhattan.
To sum up: perfect location, perfect apartment, perfect host for a perfect stay in the most perfect city in the world!"
16421,726021,17/11/11,1249053,Ramón,"Mark is a charming host, the apartment is clean and obviously well taken care of. You can't beat the location for easy access - from  Museum Mile and Central Park all the way down to Greenwich Village and Wall Street. Mark's place is an oasis in the chaos of midtown Manhattan. Can't wait to go back...."
16421,732970,21/11/11,279704,Mark,I just keep coming back!  Mark is a delight to stay with...always accomodating yet never intrusive.  Heaven in Hell's KItchen is ALWAYS my first choice when visiting NYC.  
16421,748901,28/11/11,231572,Robert,We had a great time at Mark’s during Thanksgiving week. Mark proved to be a interesting and considerate host.  Unfortunately we didn't see much of him as he decided to go home for Thanksgiving. We enjoyed having the apartment to ourselves but it was a little disappointing to not have a chance to get better acquainted with Mark. The apartment was great - clean and comfortable. His location is spectacular – two blocks from Times Square and there's cheap (relatively!) garage parking right across the street. A really good experience – we'll be back.
16421,773370,9/12/11,1156380,Jorge,"i stay with Mark for 4 days the first week of December, my stayed in his apt overall was pleasuring , his apt is clean, organized and well located, just two blocks from time square. this was my first time using Airbnb i did felt little strange staying in someones place without knowing them. 
"
16421,855733,10/1/12,88507,Liam,"Mark was very welcoming. The apartment is very clean, tidy, and well-appointed. The location can't be beat: 4 minutes walk to Billy Elliot the Musical. Very little road noise in the apartment. Highly recommended!"

The room was quiet and Mark was a good host.
The location is quite close to Broadway, Central park and many stores."
16421,1031090,22/3/12,261818,David,Mark is a great host and his garden deck is a big plus! Would not hesitate to stay there again. So easy to get around and a very pleasent experience.

He was informative with directions, knowledgable of points of interest and a wow at restaurant choices.
His location is superb, he made his home our home and his garden IS HEAVEN in Hells Kitchen. We intend recommending him to our friends.
Thanks Mark, Helen and Ann

His apartment was located in a perfect spot were you could easily access many places by subway or walking. He gave us very useful suggestions on where to eat, shop and what to see.

16421,1466000,12/6/12,231753,Randall,"I have stayed in many other NYC neighborhoods and types of accommodation. This stay was among my most-pleasant and interesting. And considering what hotels are charging nearby, Heaven in Hell's Kitchen is great value.

For a theatre-goer like me, Mark's location cannot be beat. Almost all Broadway theatres are less than 10 minutes' walk away. The dining options on nearby 9th and 10th Aves. are outstanding. Proximity to subways (2 minute walk), Port Authority Bus Terminal, and Penn Station is excellent.

The apartment is very old, and that is part of its charm. If you only rent the single room, it is fairly dark as its window does look into an air shaft. If you pay a bit more and take the double room, you get lovely light. I slept in both rooms, and found both to be comfortable. Both rooms are about the same size, but since the double room has a larger bed, there isn't a lot of wiggle space. Mark makes some closet and drawer space available. My partner and struggled to juggle a ton of luggage in the tiny space but we managed. 

We were lucky to have great weather, and took full advantage of the very pleasant deck. 

The kitchen was very well set up--had everything we needed for a bit of toast and coffee. 

It's important to remember that this is a person's home--it is NOT your dedicated apartment. Mark LIVES HERE. The space is full of his collected art, his books, and his style. If you're looking for someplace modern, private, and austere, look elsewhere.

Mark is a lovely host. We really enjoyed getting to know him, and loved staying with a real New Yorker for a few days. He was totally accommodating with our arrival and departure schedule, and overall helped make our NYC stay very easy and pleasant. 

Again, excellent value.



"
16421,1521651,20/6/12,1400870,Tanny,"A lot of what others write about is true: great location as it is close to a major station and nearby broadway. Overall clean, tho the towels are worn out. We really appreciated the quick wifi too, and breakfast was simple but good to have!

It is decorated in Mark's unique style - the living room is moulin rouge red! We stayed in the room with a double bed. I couldn't tell if it was a sunny or cloudy day when I looked out the window from my side of the bed though. 

It's true the room is small -  but we expected it in New York. Because Mark is living there tho, I feel it would be too cramped to also rent out the other room to other guests as Mark mentions could be the case in his profile - three ppl really is the limit. 

Mark also ran his massage service while we were there but gave us ample notice. 

Thanks Mark!
"
16421,1566214,26/6/12,2260296,Helen,"A great location, and a really lovely patio in the middle of NYC.  We didn't see much of Mark, but he left us his cell phone# so we could contact him. His apartment was clean and tidy. I had asked by email for the use of both bedrooms, but only one  was  made available, which was a pity, because we were rhere during hot, humid weather. The air conditioner is very close to the bed, so not exactly easy to sleep  with it  blowing on you. During cooler weather, the room would have been fine.
I would return sometime, but not during a heatwave!  Mark is a gracious host,  very helpful, and discreet."
16421,1608595,2/7/12,2034084,Jane,Mark is a gracious host who goes out of his way to open his home to his guests. Beautiful garden and incredible location. Wonderful experience!

The little terrace is lovely and very pleasant to use after a hard day in New York.
I have not met Mark but it was very easy to communicate. Marjory received us very kindly. Thank you !"
16421,1855433,31/7/12,3033135,Paul,"Mark and I corresponded via email and he was always very quick to reply.  His apartment is very comfortable and the location is just as advertised, just steps away from Times Square.  I can definitely recommend his accommodations."
16421,2176251,3/9/12,2144820,Olivier,I feel lucky having stayed at Mark's place. The location is (more than) perfect and the apartment terrace is amazing to have breakfast every morning. I hardly saw him as he was away but he had made sure ahead of time that I would feel at home at his place. Great stay !
16421,2236350,9/9/12,2110119,Agnès,"L'appartement de Mark est idéalement situé pour permettre à ses invités de profiter au maximum de toutes les attractions de New York.

16421,2509979,5/10/12,2236163,Maite,"La situación es inmejorable y la zona tranquila. El patio es una zona de desahogo muy interesante.
Mark es muy cuidadoso con sus huespedes y trató de no hacer ruido y de hacer todo lo posible porque estuvieramos cómodos.
La casa resulta pequeña para  4 (tres huespedes y el anfitrión) a pesar de que Mark puso todo su interés porque estuvieramos bien. Si volvemos 2 adultos iríamos ahí, pero no con el niño.
En las fotos que vimos en airbnb nos hicimos a la idea de que eran dos camas en una habitación, pero no era así y  Mark se dio cuenta un par de días antes y buscó la solución.
La cocina  está muy bien, aunque el baño no está al mismo nivel.
Teniendo en cuenta la relación calidad - el precio la valoración es positiva."
16421,2563447,9/10/12,3517584,Aaron,"Mark was accommodating with our late arrival time, laid back and a great host. "
16421,2785418,2/11/12,3604350,Xavier,Mark est un très bon hôte. Nous sommes arrivés peu avant l'arrivée de Sandy pour une durée de 6 nuits. Ce fut très agréable de rester chez lui. Il a su nous rassurer durant l'ouragan et nous conseiller quand nous avions besoin. Bref notre première expérience avec airbmb est une belle réussite.
16421,2822313,7/11/12,2032782,Julie,"During our stay at ""Heaven"", Mark's little oasis in mid-town Manhattan, we enjoyed his easy-going nature, including a very accommodating check-in, check-out arrangement, good conversation, sharing of some ""treats"" and trivia.  Though we came to participate in the NYC Marathon, we managed to enjoy the city despite the unfortunate but understandable cancellation of the event partly due to Mark's eager disposition to help us find the location of places we wanted to get to while there.  We found the location to be conveniently central to everywhere we wanted go.  We walked EVERYWHERE from Mark's place.  I DO hope to return to actually run the marathon next year and would LOVE to stay in ""Heaven"" once again!  Mark was an exquisite host."
16421,2859215,11/11/12,3966922,Robert,Mark is an excellent host; he is both unobtrusive and genuine.  The location is very central and certainly represents great value. Would definitely stay again! 
16421,2908470,18/11/12,30555,Prakoso,"Mark's apartment is clean and neat. It is really quiet at night since it is quite far from traffic. But the most important thing is that the place is really close to anything must see in New York: Broadway, Madison Square, Central Park and Penn Station. Subway station is just minutes walk. I really like the place! Moreover, Mark is very nice and ready to help with guidance and direction if you need it. I definitely will stay there again if I have a chance to get to NY again.... Ups, one more thing to note that Marks's neighbour is also very nice and helpful: when I leave the apartment with luggages that beyond my handling, one of Mark's neighbour that coincidently also leaving his apartment, greeted and offered some help to carry one of my luggages! It is really surprising for me...."
16421,2958177,25/11/12,3955729,Jean-Daniel,"Great location close to everything! Very quiet cosy appartment that we had all to ourselves (3 personns). We shall come in the summertime to enjoy the beautiful back garden as well, that Mark has nicely put together, as well as the nice interior!

Je recommande et ne manquerais pas d'y séjourner de nouveau quand je retourne à NYC."
16421,3146632,24/12/12,3792753,Jorge Olmar,"Mark is a fantastic host and his flat is great also. Very close to theatres, Time Square, buses (Port Authority), subway a few meters. In addition, no noise at all. Many restaurants in the area for all meals. I highly recommend this flat. Thanks Mark for the great week in NYC."
16421,3388537,21/1/13,4694940,Paolo,"Mark is a very discrete, friendly and easy-going gentleman. The flat itself is cozy and clean. There was coffee in the morning and I was offered muffins and yoghurt for the morning.

I would have been better served knowing upfront about details to ease my stay by the host (location of lights, heat in the bathroom, wifi code - the wifi was spotty and luckily I had my own hotspot). The room I stayed in was serviceable - I was expecting a double bed and not a single trundle bed with a thin mattress which was barely long enough for someone 5'10"" and an uncovered throw cushion as a pillow. Also, I would suggest dedicating the room exclusively to paying guests instead of having personal items in the room and the closet almost full with personal belongings.

As another guess noted there is only an air conditioner for ventilation. It was uncomfortably hot (notorious for NY buildings with steam heat) and luckily I discovered (by myself) that I could open the window from the top of the unit which made it bearable. (Although I then had to contend with rutting pigeons in the breezeway - literally) Luckily, I had a pair of earplugs with me which of course is not practical when you need to hear an alarm to wake up.

The flat is quiet from outside noise but the one significant noise inside the apartment is a loud chime clock that rings on the hour (imagine the chimes between the hours of 4 and 12!) and once on the half hour. I understand that it is probably a quaint and charming piece but impractical for staying, paying guests who perhaps many have jet lag to contend with and won't be staying long enough to build up a ""resistance.""

Finally, I was surprised to read from another guest that Mark asked if she was going to be out because he had a massage client coming and he wanted to set up in the guest room. I imagined that I would be incredulous...and then he asked me as well! The client wound up canceling but nonetheless it was surprising.

Again, Mark is a charming and welcoming chap. I think with a few adjustments/details attended to it could be a nice alternative to a hotel."

It's only a block away from the Metro and 7th Ave, where all the lights and people are.  Go A few more blocks in the opposite direction and you're enjoying the view of the Hudson River!  Lots of great shows and restaurants nearby. Mark is a pleasant host, quiet and unobtrusive, but helpful and kind. The place is small, but very comfortable.
I enjoyed my stay very much and have only one regret; that I did not invite Mark to lunch!

Mark es una persona muy atenta, amable y simpática. El departamento está a unos pasos del Time Square, Broadway, y de la estación del metro, tren y bus. El departamento tiene un pequeño jardín, lo cual es difícil de imaginarse a unos pasos del Time Square. Los pocos momentos que lo vimos, ya que salíamos a hacer nuestros recorridos por NY a partir e las 9.00 a.m. y regresábamos a eso de las 9.00 p.m., tuvimos oportunidad de conversar con él y nos daba consejos de cosas para visitar que sólo los neoyorquinos conocen. El desayuno fue bueno.
Maks Wohnung liegt sehr zentral, einen Häuserblock vom Time Square entfern. Die SUBWAY-Station liegt nur zwei Minuten entfernt. Auch vom Flughafen ist man in 30 Minuten dort und braucht kein teueres Taxi. Das Zimmer ist zwar etwas klein, doch das ist in NY bei den dortigen Mieten so. Dafür ist es sehr sauber. Die Gegend ist sehr ruhig, Und Mark ist ein exzellenter Gastgeber, Sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Jeden Morgen war der Kaffee schon gekocht. Er gab auch eine Menge an Tipps. Wir können die Unterkunft jederzeit empfehlen und haben uns in den 6 Tagen sehr wohl gefühlt.

Er ist ein sehr netter Mensch, leider konnten wir uns nicht so gut unterhalten, wegen der fehlenden Sprachkenntnissen. Das Zimmer ist praktisch gelegen Nähe Bus-Terminal. Idealer für Single betreffend der Platzverhältnisse. Idyllischer Hofgarten mitten in der Grossstadt. Marc ist ein sehr freundlicher, diskreter Gastgeber immer bereit für Ratschläge und Auskünfte.
Wir danken Marc für alles und denken gerne an diese Zeit zurück."
16421,5077257,11/6/13,261818,David,This is the 2nd time I have stayed with Mark-another great experience! I just love the deck in the back of the apt. and mark is such a great host. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.
16421,5147225,15/6/13,6293886,Daniel,"Perfect location, nice garden and great breakfast for a good price! Mark is considerate and friendly. You need to have the AC on in the summer if you live in the small bedroom as I did. The AC is noisy, but earplugs worked fine for me."
16421,5274821,22/6/13,6021416,Steph,We stayed at Mark's for one week and he was a pleasant and respectful host. It is in a great location very close to Time Square and therefore lots of subway lines. The apartment itself is very clean however in the mornings can be quite noisy with the window open which unfortunately is a necessity with the summer heat. The room we stayed in was quite small for two people as was the bathroom however there is a lovely terrace that you can utilise. As with a lot of NYC apartments the lighting is poor however the dark decor (mostly dark red) didn't help the situation- the photo is quite deceptive as the room is not as light as it appears. These were however only small disadvantages of the apartment.
16421,5559153,6/7/13,6363631,Josh,"Mark's place is in the best location in the heart of midtown. Everything you need including great food, the subway and Times Square are only minutes away by foot. The place is a small apartment with a large outdoor area (the biggest room in the place!). Mark is friendly and welcoming and has a good knowledge of the local area. We stayed in the double room and space is tight, especially with 3 suitcases, but if you spend most of your time out of the apartment like we did this isn't a big deal and the location more than makes up for it.

The only issue we encountered was the place had been double booked. The second room in the apartment had been booked as well as our room for the first 2 nights of our stay, we were only made aware of this on arrival. This made things extra tight for the first couple of nights.

Aside from the double booking I would reccomend Mark's place to others."

Ce fut très agréable de rentrer chaque soir à ""la maison"", retrouver Mark et partagé avec lui les moments intéressants de la journée. L'accueil de Mark fut toujours chaleureux et discret à la fois ce que j'ai apprécié. Son appartement est décoré avec beaucoup de goût et la petite terrasse pour le petit déjeuner est inestimable. Merci Mark et à très bientôt, j'espère "
16421,5984142,25/7/13,3845083,Cristina,"Es un piso con una ubicación perfecta: a 5 min andando de Times Square, a 15 de Central Park, a unos 20 del Empire State...Además, está al lado de la estación de autobuses de Port Authority, donde también está la boca de metro y a a la cual llegan los autobuses express de los aeropuertos, por ejemplo.
La casa está bien, tiene una terraza que le da ""vida"". No es demasiado espaciosa, pero suficiente, si la idea es pasar el día visitando la ciudad. Cuando nosotros hemos estado, había un poco de ruido de la calle por las mañanas, ya que tiene un parking al lado, y no sé si había alguna obra cercana. Pero bueno, nada que no puedan solucionar unos tapones.
Por otro lado, Mark incluyó el desayuno en el precio de la habitación, lo cual es de agradecer!
Mark es una persona muy agradable, siempre dispuesto a resolver cualquier duda sobre la ciudad.
Recomendaría totalmente la casa, sobre todo por la ubicación."

16421,8186791,20/10/13,5542067,Heiner,"I stayed at Mark´s Appartment for five days and had a great time there. 
He's a very pleasant person and an excellent NYC-Guide and makes you feel immediately welcome. Pretty cool place to stay! Location, Location, Location. Only five minutes walk to Times Square, Subway, Theater Distric and another major locations but also very quiet. It is clean, complimentary lighting and beautifully decorated. I loved to eat my breakfast at his nice terrace. The kitchen was very well set up and every morning I woke up the coffee already was made.
Thank you Mark.

16421,8441462,31/10/13,6856364,Nino,"Hi, wie had great time in NY staying @Marks appartment. 
The appartment is located in the heart of Manhattan and has a very interesting flair. It was always a feeling of coming home, when we arrived back from our tours, seeing candles lit. A great thing to mention is also the garden deck which belongs to the apartment, which is very cozy and amazing to have in this location. Mark is a very tidy(also the apartment), friedly and helpful person. He enjoys his life. He was a great host from the beginning(emails, questions etc. before our arrival and during our stay). I would definitely recommend him. Thanks Mark"
16421,8583278,6/11/13,7990648,John,Mark is very accommodating with my schedule and a great host! You wouldn't find a better bargain in such a prime location!  A very easy walk to Time Sq. and the Subway.

Our stay was comfortable, house was clean and tidy. "
16421,9189675,12/12/13,7237910,Adrien,"The positive: Mark is a very friendly and easygoing person. His apartment is perfectly located in midtown, close to the subway and all Broadway theaters. It is also on the ground floor so no stairs to walk up with your luggage. Coffee was made every morning. He was very accommodating with my arrival/departure times.
The negative : the apartment is old, poorly maintained and very dirty. Most surfaces are covered with dust and hair, and the bathroom is very moldy, especially the bathtub. The single room is small and was scalding hot so I had to sleep with the window half open which got very noisy at night when it was raining or snowing.
"
16421,9344665,23/12/13,9247239,Aron,"My expectations were exceeded. Mark was helpful throughout the entire process from booking, arrival, stay, and departure. Additionally, he was very accomodating given my very early arrival and departure, this was extremely helpful! The apartment was clean, large, and extremely convenient (half a block away from a main subway station). I'd stay at Mark's place without hesitation in the future."
16421,9409660,27/12/13,10122457,Shuo,Great trip in New York during Xmas and new year. Mark's place has great location. I walked around all the time. And jogging in central park. He himself is a nice guy! Thanks for letting me stay:)

16421,10036368,27/1/14,9336198,Sylvain,"Staying at Mark's place was a privilege : his flat is very well located, a block away from Time Square, really close to the bus terminal and a subway station. Although not so big, the flat is nice and well decorated. We haven't had the opportunity to spend time in the private garden, due to the cold and snowy weather, but it looks great. More important, it's calm and quiet, as it doesn't face a road. 
Mark himself is friendly, accomodating and not complicated. His French is good, and even better now he had welcomed 2 French guests ;-) In short, a great place to stay. 
Sorry Mark, but next time we'll come to New York, you'll have to welcome us again ;-)"

16421,10587930,26/2/14,90154,Meg,"A quiet apartment on the ground floor of a side street, toward the center of the block with a garden in the back.  The bed is comfortable and there is a closet with lots of hangars as well as drawers under the bed.  Mark has breakfast things such as bread, English muffins, yogurt, coffee and tea, and you can help yourself.  The spaces are small, but that is typical of New York.  Mark is a very relaxed host and we came and went during the day, even returning to nap in the afternoon.  It is a really good value for that location."
16421,10875466,11/3/14,5643896,Victoria,"I had a great stay at Marks place. 
Unfortunately the weather was very cold whilst I was there and the bedroom is extremely cold at night and the heater is very loud. Luckily I was very tired each night but wouldn't recommend this for light sleepers. 
Mark's place couldn't be in a better location for theatre lovers like myself and its great to be able to walk a few blocks and be able to roll into bed. 
Mark provides a lot of storage which can be rare in some airbnb places and was a great help. 
Hoping to head back to the city in the summer and will definitely check if Mark's place is available.

The heater in the bedroom was a bit on the noisy side, but we almost felt like it sounded like the ocean so we made the most of it!
A simple breakfast and available coffee every morning goes a long way as well.
Thanks again for having us, hopefully you'll get a chance to experience Nova Scotia some day as well! We'll warn you, it's not quite as busy here :)

Mark's apartment is perfectly located for exploring the city, particularly if you love the theatre - there are so many theatres within five or ten minutes walk!

 "
16421,12206140,26/4/14,3373283,Tonya,"This is a great place to stay. The location is phenomenal and Mark is a fabulous host. He has thought a lot about what a traveller needs, notably: Insider information about the best way to get to his place from the airport, welcoming towels with guest soaps and lotions, and space; that is, places to put your things. Mark has created space in the medicine cabinet in the washroom for you to store your toiletries, and he has created space in the bedroom via a drawer under the bed and room in the closet to hang your clothes on a variety of hanger styles (bigger hangers for heavy coats, silk hangers for that little black dress, and trouser hangers too). I noticed a clothes iron was available too, though I didn't use it. Mark has a big bowl filled with the quintessential big, red apple, appropriately selected for those visiting The Big Apple. It's nice to have fresh fruit available. He also provides excellent, freshly-ground coffee, and lovely English muffins with apricot jam for breakfast. He also offers a variety of yoghurt flavors (banana, strawberry, blueberry, etc.), which makes for a well-rounded breakfast. Mark is a mild-mannered man who is very easy-going, friendly, and a great conversationalist. I highly recommend this spot!"

Mark var en behagelig og venlig mand der var der for os, hvis vi manglede hjælp. Vores værelse var lille, og med kufferter havde vi lidt svært ved at komme rundt - men der var rent og hyggeligt.

The host has a hot pot of coffee to welcome you each morning,the home is spotlessly clean,and there is a lovely patio which is lit with candles in the evening.We both enjoyed the time we spent with our host.

Mark offered restaurant recommendations, and provided a great breakfast and excellent coffee. 

Despite it being a small apartment it felt very much like a home (which is what I'd expect from AirBnB) and not once did we feel awkward or like we were in the way.

My only criticism was that even though we were given a time to check out of the apartment as some renovation work was about to be carried out, we were asked to leave 45 minutes before that time as the Super of the building had arrived. Luckily we were ready to go and it wasn't too inconvenient, however we really did feel rushed and a little unwelcome at the end of our stay. "

We were made to feel very welcome and had full use of the apartment. The apartment was of a good standard and as a bonus were really lucky with the weather so managed to have breakfast in the gated garden/decking area.

The English muffins and fresh coffee every morning were a great start to the day.

Mark was very helpful and was able to answer any questions we had regarding local attractions & transport or questions about New York in general.

The room is small but comfortable, and everything in the apartment works as it should. There isn't a ton of shared space in the place, but Mark and his partner are both laid back and easy to hang out with, so I didn't feel cramped.

Overall, a good experience! I would particularly recommend the place to anyone who puts a high premium on location/convenience, as it is literally steps to any number of solid locations."

I enjoyed the breakfast they created for me, simple and perfect.  And the coffee really punched me up for my busy days. Their place is literally a zen oasis in the center of perfect NYC chaos.  A great place to wind down and relax after long days of conferences and walking about.

16421,37972104,12/7/15,6470814,Timothy,Mark and Xiao were very welcoming hosts!  The location of their place was perfect for a workshop in the theatre district.   We especially enjoyed the lovely private deck.   We hope to visit again!
16421,38819813,19/7/15,29176177,Ilaria,"Mark and Xiao were welcoming and friendly, they gave me advices if I needed them. They also offered me free breakfast in the morning anddidn't  have problems with my late check-in and check-out.

The location of the apartment is great, it's 5 minutes by foot from Times Square and 1 minute from the E subway that takes you directly to JFK. I also appreciated the quiet of the apartment and neighborhood, it's  like you're not in the center of Manhattan at all!"
16421,39903649,27/7/15,21598425,Gill,"Mark & Xiao's apartment is in a really convenient location, just a couple of minutes walk from Times Square, the subway and also the Port Authority bus terminal which is connected by a direct bus link to Newark Liberty airport. It's a great base from which to explore all areas of the city and for experiencing the buzz of The Big Apple. The apartment is smaller than we expected but has a lovely decking area outside which we really appreciated as we drank our morning coffee and planned our daily activities via the WiFi connection. Mark was helpful when we asked for information and gave us some lovely recommendations, notably Bryant Park. He was also very flexible with our arrival and departure times and we greatly appreciated being able to shower and change and leave late on our last day ready for our long journey home."
16421,40615585,1/8/15,36699350,Theresa,"We enjoyed our stay in NY and the hospitality of Mark, Xiao and Franco their new, sweet puppy. We appreciated the flexibility for our arrival and departure time. The room was comfortable and a nice place to return in the late afternoon for a break before heading out again. The location was very convenient and close to the subway. We were a few minutes walk to Madison Square Garden and the Broadway Shows. We enjoyed our morning breakfasts in the courtyard and took advantage of the coffee, English muffins and jam that was offered. It was a memorable stay!"
16421,46694199,13/9/15,25708487,Marion,"Super séjour chez Mark et son mari, personnes très sympathiques et appartement idéalement situé. Au pied de Times Square et de toutes commodités !!"
16421,48057610,23/9/15,19420128,Joan,"On arrival Xiaomin greeted me and certainly made me feel very welcome.  He showed me my room and explained that Mark was working.  The apartment block is very old and modest so don't have high expectations.  If you are after ultra modern comfort then this is not the room for you.
The room I had was tiny, as was the whole apartment, and although there is a window there is no natural light.  I think the double room is brighter. This was a little disconcerting but I quickly adapted to the surroundings.  I found the bed very  comfortable.  There is a very pleasant outdoor area available for guests.
When I met Mark that evening he was also very friendly and hospitable.  As my stay progressed the relationship became more friendly and we had some very pleasant chats.  Thanks for that Mark.
The position is fantastic, 100 meters from the subway and right at Times Square.  I was keen to see as many Broadway shows as possible during my stay and I did this with just a short walk ""home"" afterwards among all the hoards of people.  I never ever felt unsafe.
I used the accommodation solely as sleeping quarters and suited me perfectly for my needs.
There are numerous restaurants and bars in the area plus all the theatres.  The TKTS booth is an eight minute walk away.  Penn Station is one stop away and the Port Authority Bus Station 2 minutes walk."
16421,48866356,29/9/15,17989113,Hulya,"We had delayed because of tranporting to the city. When we arrived in Mark& Xiao's apartment they were waiting for us. There was nothing about delaying.  Mark gave us some information about our room and breakfast.
Mark & Xiao were great hosts and friendly and helpful. Mark gave us many information and recommendations almost everymorning in their lovely courtyard while we had delicious coffees.
The apartment is a great location, so close to Times Square, the subway, the Port Authority bus terminal and to almost everywhere in Manhattan. Our room is smaller than we looked at on photos but is a sufficiently convenient and very clean. The courtyard was so beautiful and it was surprising to find in the middle of Manhattan like this very quietly place. Wi fi was powerful in the apartment everywhere.
The district is very safe and there are a lot of nice restaurants , bars , coffees and theatres.
Mark  & Xiao made us feel like staying our home.

Thank you for everything Mark & Xiao !!"
16421,50913319,16/10/15,24233208,Laetitia,Première expérience airbnb réussie. La chambre est idéalement située tout près de Times square ainsi que du métro.  Les hôtes sont très accueillant et nous mettent à l'aise.
16421,54705182,23/11/15,29877034,David,"Welcoming, nice, interesting couple. Great location. Amazingly quiet, being so close to Times Square and 42nd street. Nice patio to enjoy in the warmer months. Great public transportation close by."
16421,55193805,29/11/15,6015198,Ronnie,"Mark and Xiao were phenomenal hosts! They made us feel welcome in their home and were extremely friendly to us at all times throughout our stay. They were both very compassionate and understanding individuals, especially when it came to my Tourette’s. The room was a bit smaller than I had expected, but that’s just a personal observation and wasn’t an issue at all. The bed was comfortable, the room was cozy, and the neighborhood was great — right near an awesome vegan place that my girlfriend and I both loved! I just want to add that as a New Yorker myself, I felt that people in Manhattan are generally not as friendly as people elsewhere, such as in Providence and Boston. However, Mark and Xiao were an incredible exception to that rule. They are genuinely caring and all-around amazing people, and I would definitely book again if my girlfriend and I come back! Thanks Mark and Xiao!"
16421,56044562,8/12/15,43499322,Jakapong,Mark and Xiao were very helpful and supportive during my stay (3 nights). It was the first time for airbnb and they made me impress and confident on using the website!! I recommend everyone who is looking for NY accommodation to stay here!! Not only is this place super convenient but the host are also give a warm welcome. The only bad thing I could find is the space but this is TIME SQUARE NEW YORK!! The rest are as displayed in website. Nice and clean.
16421,58113935,1/1/16,21958187,Lilin,"It is great staying with Mark and Xiao, there's lots of interaction and communication with them. The room is rather small but their apartment is conveniently located - the street corner subway entrance, 5 min walk to port authority bus terminal and less than 15 min walks to most broadway theatre. The neighbourhood is safe. The laundry room is useful for us."
16421,58774513,5/1/16,41965914,Chris,"Mark and Xiao were fantastic hosts during my vacation to NYC. They were both extremely friendly and welcoming throughout the trip, and went out of their way to make sure I had everything I needed. The apartment was beautiful, and very clean. Their chihuahua mix is very high energy and very friendly. When I was out of the apartment I could always contact them when I had questions. Their apartment is in a terrific location, especially if your plans involve the theater. I was able to walk everywhere I needed to go within minutes. 

Overall, Mark's ad covers all the information you need to know before booking them. The only surprise was that Mark and Xiao sometimes have massage clients come to the apartment during which they want to maintain privacy. However, they are very good about letting you know in advance when they need the apartment. 

This was my longest stay in an Air B'n'B apartment, and Mark and Xiao made it an excellent experience. I highly recommend them!"
16421,61756301,8/2/16,49849244,Yueyue,"Excellent location. This place has everything you need to have an incredible time in NewYork. It is super clean with very nice upkeep. Mark and Xiao were very helpful.They tell us where delicious fun, can help us to answer all the questions, and they give us to prepare breakfast. Their dog is very cute, and we love him.We had a great time  and really enjoyed our stay here. We recommend to all, and hope to return some day."
16421,62616095,15/2/16,2759506,Sarah,"Mark was a great host he made me feel very welcome upon arrival. The room is nice with lots of places to put your things. There was also space for me in the kitchen and bathroom.I loved the neighborhood it was away from the choas of time square but close enough that you could walk everywhere from the apartment, the transport links were idea. The street 9th half a block from the flat has tons and tons of cute restaurants, cafes, and bars. Also shops if you need anything like clothes of pharmacy. Staying at this flat in particular made my stay in new york so relaxed and adaptable. I definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to be in the center but be able to get anywhere in the city at short notice. Mark was very flexible with my schedule and it felt like staying in a home. I highly recommend them for your trip. "
16421,65774253,17/3/16,7479513,Femke,"The apartment was great! Mark and Xiao were very interested and helpful when we needed tips or when we just wanted to chat. Their dog, Franco, is very cute and playful. They made us feel at home and gave us a tour of the beautifully designed apartment!"

Leur appart est petit mais très cosy et meublé avec gout (on s'y sent bien d'emblée) et le jardin est extra (je pense qu'un jardin de cette taille est rare dans ce quartier). Idéalement situé à 5 min à pied de Time Square et donc de Broadway et de ses shows et de toutes les facilités de transport. Étonnamment calme pour la situation. Je recommande vivement. "

16421,76760915,29/5/16,8947981,Diego,"The flat is beautiful and its location unbeatable. The bed is also nice. The indications were clear and Mark was always willing to help me. The garden is really a piece of heaven.  

However, if you go in hot season the AC is very noisy. One day my host woke me up at 10 to get something out of the room while I was sleeping. I did no appreciate this. "
16421,77781479,3/6/16,46037388,Debbie,"My husband and I spend 5 wonderful days in New York with Mark and Xiao. Their apartment is stylish and comfortable in the most convenient location we could imagine -- just blocks from theatre district and great restaurants, right on a metro line, and a comfortable walk to Central Park. Their deck garden is FABULOUS; and Mark and Xiao are delightful company and wonderful hosts along with their dog Franco. Looking forward to staying with them again the next time we visit New York."

I especially loved their large garden area to sit in an zone out after a big day of sightseeing. Mark always made me coffee fresh for breakfast with fresh fruit and English muffins which was very convenient and a nice way to start the day. Much better than a hotel!
16421,85455572,11/7/16,51633165,Rami,Mark was a hospitable host with a fantastic partner and friendly little dog once he gets to know you. I was not around much but Mark never failed to provide me with anything I asked and always had a clean well maintained house.

Can walk everywhere or Subway is at corner of their street. Great food and theatre nearby. Franco very cute too! Def will visit again. ..our no 1 recommended place to stay in Nyc. "
16421,89255388,27/7/16,68083051,Thijs,"We had an amazing time in NYC, a large part of that experience was due to our stay with Mark and Xiou. The apartment was located in a amazing neighborhood in NYC, close to times square, empire state, a lot of good restaurants and metro/bus. Hosts are very friendly and flexible. The room is quite small but was big enough for us with enough space to store your baggage. Outside space was nice to eat breakfast in or relax after a long day in New York. Would recommend and come again if i'm ever in New York again!"

L'appartement est très bien situé à 5 mn du métro et de Times Square. La chambre est petite mais c'est suffisant pour dormir. Le lit est très confortable.
Le plus est le petit jardin, en plein cœur de New York c'est rare... Un petit havre de paix après une longue journée de marche au milieu de la foule. Ainsi que le petit déjeuner dans le jardin, vraiment très appréciable.
Nous sommes restées 6 nuits avec ma fille et nous sommes vraiment enchantées.
It is really Heaven in Hell's kitchen !
"
16421,94669101,16/8/16,76311064,Benedetta,"Mark and Xiaomin's hospitality was really warm! 
The announcement was absolutely truthful: 
the house and my room were both cute and clean; the deck garden was also beautiful, a perfect place to have breakfast or take a rest.
I heard Mark by email in the weeks before my arrival, he was helpful and kind to provide me with information about the house and the airport transfer.
At home there was Xiaomin to welcome me, along with the dog Franco, a nice big chihuahua; during the week we better knew each other. Xiaomin was very kind and helpful providing me with info on the subway; at the same time he was discreet and respectful of my space and my moments of rest and reading. He also prepared delicious breakfast each morning, a luxury for airbnb ... I think.

The location was... perfect, so central, in the heart of Mid Town, so close to Times Square...

I felt like at home,and I felt moved when I leaved Xiaomin last Monday. I hope we will stay in touch ...
For sure I will recommend Mark and Xiaomin's house to friends who intend to visit New York."

They were kind enough to leave me brochures next to my bed with ideas of things to do and even a subway map - although I mostly relied on (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps, to be honest. Also, providing breakfast was great and unexpected and very much appreciated (especially since I got to eat it on the fantastic back porch). Overall, they were really nice and always made me feel welcome and never like I was imposing. I would definitely recommend staying with them, as I would do it again in a heartbeat! "

We met Mark a few days before leaving and he couldn't have been more helpful or welcoming while simultaneously giving us space to enjoy our holiday independently.

The apartment is well decorated with some lovely features as well as all the conveniences you would expect.

Highly recommended!"

We also had some nice conversations with them. As the apartment is centrally located, we didn't  have to use the subway often. We slept very good, the bed was comfortable and there was no noise. The breakfast was very good too. It's a  cosy and clean apartment in which we felt comfortable. Franco the little dog is cute and friendly.

Considering how central it was the room was incredibly quiet and the bed heaven comfy. The hosts are really nice and welcoming! I was really busy visiting the city so I didn't have much time to spend with them but the little bit I talked to them was very pleasant! Their dog is also adorable! Finally, something I found amazing is the shower had really good water pressure and a shower head that could be moved around. I highly recommend this place to anyone interested in staying in Manhattan."

Es cómodo, con un lindo patio en donde puedes ver el cielo y disfrutar de sus plantas. Mark y Xiao fueron amables, y Franco una simpática y juguetona compañía. Debido a mis paseos cotidianos y a sus ocupaciones laborales no tuvimos muchas ocasiones para conversar, pero cuando fue necesario me ayudaron a resolver problemas. El edificio apaga la calefacción de noche, y puede hacer algo de frío, pero ellos me aportaron otra manta con lo que estuvo todo bien. Departamento muy recomendable."

16458,166175538,2/7/17,114577251,Barb,"Sara's Park Slope home is the place to be should you be visiting NYC or the surrounding area. Stepping off the private elevator and into the brightly lit home brings a warmth to the bustling city. The spacious two-story home is well decorated, clean and has two outside areas to enjoy the sites and the sounds of the city. Our summer visit allowed us to enjoy the fresh garden where we started the day picking fresh berries and listening to the laughter of the children playing in the nearby park. Views of the Statue of Liberty and lower Manhattan skyline from this patio, took our breath away. 

The Park Slope neighborhood is vibrant day and night. A fresh market on the weekend allowed us to enjoy some neighborhood delicacies. However we cannot overlook Bagel World which started each day with a true New York size breakfast. The night life in Park Slope has a wide variety of restaurants and pubs, truly something for everyone. Getting around the city couldn't have been easier with multiple subway stops close by getting us into Manhattan in less than 20 minutes. Car services and Uber were plentiful and reasonable as well. 

Even though I never met Sara as she herself was on vacation, communications was open and we felt welcomed into her home even before we arrived. Sara will be my first call when I travel into the City again. "

Don't think twice about coming to this amazing home."
16458,197125371,24/9/17,150222164,Ken,"Sara's place was a great for our NYC needs. Plenty of room for 4 of us (2 parents & 2 teens) to spread out, and the views of the Statue of Liberty & Manhattan were great. It's right in between two subway stations, so it was easy to reach Manhattan. This was the first time we have stayed in a place where the hosts actually live (they were on vacation, so we were there instead of them, not with them), but their notes were helpful and we felt (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was great prior to arrival, and we had 3-4 phone numbers to contact them if there had been any need (there wasn't!). It's not a full-time rental, but if Sara's dates line up with your dates, it's a great value...take advantage!"

My room was spacious, considering NY's tight apartments, clean and i was given lotsa hangers for my clothes! The apartment was neat and tidy, and there's a deck where you can enjoy the sun and view during Spring and Summer (I was there in Winter).

I like the neighborhood, with lotsa awesome eateries (that Sandwich place Reka recommended), UpState (1st Ave), Wafles and Dinges (East Village)... you will never be left with lousy food options. I enjoyed the vibe of the neighborhood (you just gotta explore).

The place is 10-15min walk from the subway station, but walking is not a problem for me unless I have lotsa shopping, which i will take a bus. The block is surrounded by quite a few bus stops so it was easy for me to get around Manhatten with just 1 bus ride, if you choose to ride the bus. I almost never have to take the cab here in my 2+ wks stay.

Enjoy your stay at Reka!"
16580,11495235,5/4/14,13032983,Mattias,"In short: Great apartment, excellent location, and super nice hosts.
I recommend staying here to anybody enjoying the close location to the pulse of East Village while still in a quiet neighborhood for your night sleep in a fresh apartment with a great terrace.
Don't forget to ask for restaurant tips - this source beats all guide books and blogs our there."
16580,11643357,10/4/14,10906067,Serann,"Great area to stay in. Reka & Erin were very friendly & helpful with any questions I had.

East Village is a lovely neighborhood with heaps of nice cafes and restaurants, for which Reka always had some great recommendations. "
16580,12220426,26/4/14,11585302,Sally,"Our stay with Reka & Erin in NY was nice :) The apartment is in a great location - walking distance to good bars, restaurants, shopping, etc. The apartment was clean & tidy - the rooftop patio was not in great condition but they assured us it's because they've just come out of a rough winter so I'm sure it will be nice to use during summer.  Reka was easy to communicate with and was flexible when we requested a late check out. The only down side is that the listing mentioned we'd be staying with Reka & her housemate Erin but when we got there, there was 2 more guests staying in another room next to us…also sharing the bathroom/living space & kitchen. Made for a couple awkward encounters with an older couple. Had we known there was going to be 6 people in the apartment at one time we may not have booked. Perhaps just confirm this with Reka before securing your booking. Aside from that, it was a comfortable stay - would recommend :)"
16580,12494306,4/5/14,4979649,Julie,"Really nice district for this cool appartement! One of the best in downtown with lots of restaurant, bars and coffee!"
16580,12907755,13/5/14,9236134,Mason,The listing and the neighborhood was exactly what I expected - except better.  Quick access to the FDR and the waterfront.  An easy walk to anything East Village including 1 block to Thompson Square Park.   The host was able to quickly answer any questions and ensured that everything was in place upon arrival.  Definitely a recommended East Village destination.
16580,13510683,29/5/14,1176129,Barbara,"We had a great time with Reka and Erin. Their apt is in a great location. Quiet, yet close to the Hustle and Bustle of the east village. They go about their normal life while you are there so you really feel like just living with them, They were really easy going and friendly. For us, the big,big bonus was that we could borrow their bikes. That really made our trip! "
16580,13950662,9/6/14,12855743,Beat,"Great bedroom with a very comfortable bed and really cool view. Very clean and friendly apartment in a rather quiet neighborhood, but close to all the East Village fun places... Highly recommended!"

She was very busy with work so we basically had the appartment to ourselves all day. It was very nice to have our breakfast in the morning on her sunny rooftop balcony with a beautiful view on parts of Manhattan. The neighboorhood is really nice, with lots of good restaurants and bars. The appartment is close to a metro station (a 10 min walk) so all other neighboorhoods of Manhattan are in fact very close by!"

16580,22442850,6/11/14,22748568,Maria Teresa,"Cuando llegamos a la casa Reka nos recibió muy bien y nos dió las llaves del piso en el momento. No hemos visto a Reka mucho porque fuimos de turismo y salíamos muy pronto de casa y volvíamos tarde. El barrio está bien pero bastante retirado de first avenue (parada de metro), teníamos que andar unos 20 minutos hasta la casa.
La cama de la habitación era muy cómoda y todo estaba limpio.

The bedroom is a good size with plenty of storage and bed was soooo comfy. It also had a fantastic view of NYC skyline from the bedroom and the roof terrace which we went on a few times, despite the cold weather. Reka and Erin were lovely hosts, very friendly - they are more than happy to chat with you but equally will let you get on with your trip and can be discreet if needed. Really was a perfect holiday - thank you "

Thanks again Reka! "

I plan to stay here again on my next trip to NYC"
16580,25720560,24/1/15,7023781,Ivan,"Reka and her roommate where absolutely fabulous hosts. As soon as I walked in, I was immediately enamored with the place: excellent taste, clean, and very welcoming! The description is accurate and in fact, better in real life. I would stay again at the drop of a hat. These two roommates are simply stellar in helping guests feel welcome.

And let's not forget the coffee nearby. Just across the street you have Ninth Street Espresso. They produced the best breve cortado I've had so far in Manhattan. Plenty of cool bars and restaurants in walking distance. 

I should also mention: the StairMaster in the gym  is awesome."
16580,26451945,13/2/15,25414143,(Maria)  Helena,Reka and her room mate Erin are amazing host. I had a great stay at their place and I would highly recommend it to other travelers.

My flight got cancelled due to snow so I had to cancel 1 night at their place and REKA was happy to refund me my money. Also the airline lost my luggage and they let me stay there well past a normal checkout time to wait for my luggage to be delivered. Can't say how appreciative I was!!! Area is good, amazing coffee shop across the street!"

They also had some friends staying who were really nice too. It is a 15-20min walk from the nearest subway, which was the only downside but for us was worth it to be in such a great neighborhood. Loved all the bars and restaurants in the East Village and would definitely recommend staying in this neighborhood! Really comfortable bed too! "

16580,30503287,23/4/15,3139773,Betty,"Reka and her roommate Erin were very pleasant and friendly hosts.  We arrived to NY earlier than we initially planned and Reka even let us drop off our bags early so that we would not have to pull them around the city.  And she was kind enough to drop us a text to let us know when the room was ready!  We felt quite at home staying in her apartment and we enjoyed conversation with both Reka and Erin quite a bit.  Both are highly interesting and women!  

The bed in our private room was incredibly comfy and the view of the city from the terrace was so lovely at night.  Reka gave us advice about where to eat (thank you our breakfast was delish!) and she even went out of her way to help us understand the subway and bus routes so we would not need to take a cab back to the airport.  Saved us $$$

If we ever find ourselves making a trip back to NY in the future we will certainly try and stay here again.  And when we hear of people who are making plans to visit, we will CERTAINLY tell them to look Reka and her listing up.  Thank you Reka and Erin for helping to make our trip so pleasant and enjoyable.  We wish you both well on your journey in Life!  "

East Village is a great place with a lot of good restaurants and bars. One block away from the apartment is the next bus stop from where you get to all relevant subway stations around the area.

All in all I can highly recommend the place and Reka and Erin being your hosts! "
16580,33665991,31/5/15,18346496,Rachel,"Reka and Erin were excellent hosts.  Erin met us upon arrival and talked us through the neighbourhood and the apartment.  The room was very comfortable and the flat is well equipped, clean and welcoming.  The balcony was extra special and we enjoyed our night drinks with the downtown view.  
The neighbourhood is lively and interesting.  We loved the vibe and explored many cafes and restaurants.  The apartment is a bit of a walk to the nearest subway but there is a bus stop really nearby which we used a couple of times with ease.  The only downside of the neighbourhood is the noise at night - especially with the windows open which was essential in the heat.  The apartment is worth it though and Reka and Erin are wonderful hosts - we would definitely recommend this apartment for a stay in New York and would return again."

Upon my arrival at Reka's East Village 6th floor apartment via elevator, I found a clean inviting apartment with an amazing view! The bedroom was perfect with a super comfortable and cozy bed, large window with an amazing skyline NYC view, and space for all of my things. There was also an excellent room air conditioner that cooled the room on a hot humid June night. Reka also helped me know what subways to take and looked up information on museums. The bed was very comfortable and I slept super well as I felt very safe. The neighborhood is filled with shops, and restaurants and easy access to other parts of then city. I liked walking to Soho to eat dinner and to Union Square to catch the subway uptown. I loved my stay and enjoyed living the East Village life for a couple days!! I highly recommend staying at Reka's apartment and get a feel for the East Village! "

16580,40037265,27/7/15,2517790,Ronni,"Reka and her roommate Erin were wonderful hosts to my daughter and me when we came to the city to see two shows. Reka told us about restaurants in the Lower East Side and was very accommodating when I had to change my arrival time. It is a fun area, just two blocks from the East River, with easy access to a path where you can run or walk. The apartment has an upstairs deck with a fantastic view of the city. The bed was comfortable and the apartment clean and cheerful. We shared their rather small living area with them, which was fine because none of us were around much. "

There's really good restaurants nearby as well. Reka and Erin were friendly and hospitable hosts. I would definitely stay with them again.
16580,49369652,3/10/15,2731723,Lawrence,"This apartment was exactly what I expected. No problems to report. The room was clean, had its own lock, as well as a fresh towel and linens provided. Reka and Erin were friendly and answered any questions I had as well as gave recommendations. Was a great experience and would highly recommend"
16580,49883480,7/10/15,37600241,Lisa,"Reka is a considerate and welcoming host - it was a pleasure sharing the apartment with her. The room is comfortable and clean and I was made to feel completely at home. I have travelled to New York once before on business and had stayed midtown. So it was great to have an opportunity to see a different neighbourhood. The shops, cafes and restaurants of east village are just a block or so away. 

Perhaps if you have not travelled much previously, as this is not a tourist area, it may feel a little too far from the usual sights.  However I loved it! It felt like you were part of the city and its residents - the independent stores and eateries are wonderful and the people friendly.  I spent an hour one evening drinking red wine with some shop owners where I had just popped in for a gift for my little girl and we got chatting! If you prefer to stay somewhere a little different, I would thoroughly recommend this Airbnb. 

Top tips whilst you are there - The Bean cafe has good wifi and coffee if you need somewhere to work nearby. The Cuban takeout from cafecito was great and the thin crust pizzas from Gruppo were amazing. Breakfast at Clinton street bakery is good but expect long queues at the weekend.  "
16580,50099135,9/10/15,34627531,Tom,Great place to stay and location is perfect to explore East Village. Reka was not there but able to help with an easy check in after a long flight.
16580,50346314,11/10/15,9833160,Marieke,Nice appartement at great location
16580,50650541,13/10/15,10022193,Maria Violeta,"Reka aceptó mi reserva inmediatamente y todo funcionó en forma perfecta! No tuve el gusto de conocer a mi huésped porque estaba fuera de la ciudad, pero la habitación estuvo disponible cuando lo necesitaba, la entrega de las llaves fue muy conveniente y el departamento es hermoso!!! Excelente ubicación, la zona es genial, muy cerca de todo y tranquila. El departamento está a solo unos metros de una estación de CitiBike para poder moverse por la ciudad en bicicleta. Lo que más me impresionó fue la terraza, muy linda y con una vista increíble!!! Muchas gracias, Reka, espero volver pronto!!!"
16580,51176559,18/10/15,8262176,Brian,"We did not have opportunity to meet Reka, but her roommate, Erin could not have made us feel more welcome!  She was waiting for us when we arrived to welcome us and offer some great restaurant suggestions.  They had the WiFi password and other helpful information (local grocery store, ABC store, nearest transportation etc.) very clearly written down for us.  Erin genuinely seemed excited to interact with us for the brief periods of time that we saw her but she was also great about giving us space for our vacation.  We had a great stay in this apartment and found it to be a very convenient location.    "
16580,51726099,24/10/15,3931987,Lori,"Rena was not around but Erin was a fabulous host. She was very flexible with my late in the evening arrival.  She gave me a warm welcome when I arrived and made herself available for any questions I had.  She gave helpful suggestions for places in the neighborhood for coffee, food, drinks, etc.

The apartment is located on a quiet street, combined with a super comfortable bed made for a great space to get some sleep after very full and busy days and nights in NYC.  

I especially loved having a view of lower Manhattan as well as a terrace to enjoy some fresh air, sunshine with a view.

I felt safe, comfortable and would not hesitate to recommend this place for solo travelers seeking a comfortable place in a groovy, lively neighborhood."
16580,53120941,5/11/15,45268618,Susanne,"I have been to New York many times, but this was one of my best trips - and staying in Reka's place played an important part. Reka wasn't there but her roommate Erin was great in welcoming me and making me feel at home (""What's ours is yours""). The apartment on the 6th floor is sunny and cosy and spotlessly clean, also quiet, my room wonderful, I even had the bath to myself most days. Checking in and out was easy, Erin was flexible. And when I asked how I could make coffee, she  went out and bought a French press. The neighborhood is great with so many Cafés and Restaurants and young people around. I loved talking to Erin and her friends, everything was so relaxed. I very much hope I can come back. "
16580,53913116,14/11/15,47810686,Kobi,"I had a great experience in the apartment. Erin, Reka's roommate, made me feel welcome. She was there to recommend on restaurants, and in general she was very nice and always asked me about my day. The greatest thing about the apartment is that it is sunny. It is not necessarily the case in many apartments in Manhattan. The room was very nice, not too big but not too small. I had a private bathroom, which is great, and the view from the terrace was absolutely stunning. The neighborhood is nice, quiet and calm, and there are places to hang out that are near. The only thing that was a bit of a disappointment for me was the distance to the metro, about fifteen minutes by foot, which is a bit far to my taste."
16580,54160128,16/11/15,7188727,John,"This was my second time to stay a Reka's place and was just as good as the first!  Warm reception, great location, clean, quiet, safe, comfortable room.  I feel very at home there and hope to be back soon!"

The building is beautiful with an original mosaic by Mosaic Man, a bit of Loisada history. Great location.
The apartment is clean and organized, the room spacious and tidy, with plenty of plugs and closet space.  The views are breathtaking.  Coffee was available as well as room in the fridge.
"
16580,58380203,2/1/16,7017492,Rajesh,"Reka was very helpful and friendly over phone, while she wasn't in town when I landed her flat mate Erin helped us out. Erin too was very friendly and warm. While not very close to the subway network the place is not very far from 2nd Av station. The room is small but clean and gives you a nice view to the empire estate building. Me and my 10 yr old daughter had a good stay and like most other Airbnb places I have stayed the host didn't provide breakfast. All in all a very good stay. "
16580,58982834,5/1/16,51227499,Lindsey,Reka and Erin were both incredibly nice and welcoming. I felt at home in their apartment and loved the location!

The area has a great community feel. Lots of cool little bars and restaurants, and ABC is a fantastic bottle shop just around the corner for your drink in or take out beer needs. 
Will definitely stay there again if I'm back in the area. Cheers!"
16580,63489545,23/2/16,28194119,Leonard,Great experience. Room was as described. Particularly liked the roof balcony and view of the city. Great recommendation on a fried chicken joint called Bob White. Reka was available and friendly. Definitely recommend to others.

16580,70451754,17/4/16,14025048,Luke,"Reka's apartment was a fantastic base for my short trip to New York. It is in a great location, awesome neighbourhood, with great coffee and restaurants right on the doorstep. The room itself is as described, comfy and quiet. Erin and Reka were welcoming hosts, even though we did not cross paths too often. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
16580,72807111,4/5/16,45268618,Susanne,"It was lovely once again to stay with Reka - such a bright space, so clean and welcoming. Just like coming home.

And I do hope to come back soon.
 "
16580,74052699,12/5/16,4975073,Pauline,"We spent a great week in NYC and it was very pleasant to benefit from Reka's apartment in the evenings / mornings to rest for a while before going out in this vibrant city!

The flat is well-maintened, the bedroom is nice and cosy, and above all, the district is really great: lots of restaurants, coffee shops and bars everywhere, in a young and lively atmosphere !

Even though we did not see much of Reka during our stay (busy worker!), she was very helpful and reactive when we asked for tips/questions. We therefore recommend Reka's apartment !
"

Thank you Reka! "
16580,78201333,5/6/16,29309142,Jose,"El barrio, fuera de los circuitos turísticos convencionales, es estupendo. Animado y bien comunicado además de tranquilo. La anfitriona muy amable y aunque la habitación es algo pequeña, la cama es muy buena y todo muy limpio. La terraza es un desahogo enorme que da momentos de relajo e intimidad. Lugar muy recomendable para estancias largas de más de cinco días."
16580,79967424,15/6/16,76008649,Colin,"Nice place, great neighborhood.  Loved the bedroom / bed.. very comfortable.  Fairly quiet (on tree lined street, 6th floor).. slept comfortably with the large window open (in June).  And near lots of great restaurants, bars, etc.. and a nice park 2 blocks away.  Reka was very pleasant, as were flat mates (couple that live on 2nd level).  I was only there 2 nights and one day (and was out most of the time), but felt very welcome.  Also appreciated they gave me a key to lock the bedroom.

Two issues:  Had a little trouble reaching Reka before arrival the first night, which caused some anxiety (how will I get in?), but after a few attempts, we did connect (her ringer was off).  And someone was soaking laundry in the bathroom sink for an afternoon thru the night, which meant I had to use the kitchen sink to wash face / brush teeth, etc.. not ideal.

Overall, had a good experience and would stay there again.  Thank you"
16580,80283629,17/6/16,75811161,Saquib,"Reka was a good host and provided everything I required during my stay. The only issue I faced was the wait upon arrival to her flat, as no one was in to let me in. Hence the 4 star rating. Other than that the stay was pleasant and the property was as expected."
16580,81127649,21/6/16,42692695,Jake,Fantastic experience. I highly recommend it!
16580,83581965,3/7/16,46213722,Cindy,"Reka was really flexible, on our last day she lets us leaving our luggage and took our time to check out so that was a really great positive as we were on different schedules and needed that flexibility. She was also very responsive to answer the questions."
16580,85439356,11/7/16,13615616,Mark,"Not much to add to the plethora of praise already made by other visitors. Great location, friendly hosts, clean room."

16580,88823741,25/7/16,35310457,Maia,"Perfect apartment in a perfect location! Reka and Erin were nice and welcoming, we felt really comfortable at their place. And that rooftop is just the perfect way to end a long day of tourism in New York... would absolutely repeat this experience!"
16580,90282226,31/7/16,14063236,Katharina & Christian,"We've enjoyed our one-week-stay in East Village. 
The bed was really cozy and the a/c worked well.
The private rooftop was perfect after a long walk in the city but also in the morning with an amazing view.
"
16580,91245086,4/8/16,15778637,Maria,"I made this reservation for my niece and these are her comments:
I didn't get the chance to meet Reka because she was traveling but Erin and Rob (Erin's BF) were really nice and the place was amazing.  The bedroom was very comfortable.  I would absolutely stay there again."
16580,93959429,14/8/16,79748976,Hayley,"
We didn't meet Reka, but her housemates Erin and Rob were home for much of our 9 day stay. They were so easy going, helpful and kind, and were playful and incredibly patient with our one year old. They were happy to help 'baby proof' the apartment, and shift furniture in our bedroom to fit the portacot. They also made it easy for us to have hired baby gear delivered before we arrived.
Room Pros: The WiFi worked as expected, the aircon in the bedroom was a lifesaver, and the washer/dryer in the complex was very handy. Room Cons: The gym was very small (maybe 3 cardio?), and the curtains in the bedroom weren't very effective at blocking out the light. (Thankfully, Erin got us a thick rug which we draped over and it did the trick. She also kindly offered to get new curtains...we declined!)
The apartment location was wonderful- we felt safe walking around day and night, and there were so many great restaurants and bars within walking distance, of varying price levels. There aren't too many retail stores within a mile, but plenty of delis, pharmacies, and grocery stores. Both the bus and CityBike were super close, but we used neither - instead we walked to the subway (which was only about a 10 minute walk). Once you're on the subway, we found you can get anywhere in NYC very easily."
16580,96324562,22/8/16,66146647,Mark,"Great location and a great host!Right smack bang in the middle of East Village you are close to everything that part of New York has to offer and communication with Reka was smooth(as she was away with work for the week).And that view from the private balcony of the Manhattan skyline...wow!!
If ever you come to this part of the world make sure you stay with Reka...can't recommend it enough!!!"

Le quartier d' East Village est atypique, très vivant, et on y trouve de nombreux commerces et restaurants.Nous avons également apprécié la proximité du Tompkins Park, un espace vert vivant et dynamique.
Le duplex équipé d'une superbe terrasse, avec une vue imprenable sur le One World Trade Center, nous a permis de nous ressourcer tous les soirs après des journées de visite bien remplies.
Nous recommandons ce logement pour une visite approfondie de New-York."
16580,103565647,23/9/16,9734083,Charles,Reka and her room mates provided a very warm welcome. The place is well located and has all the amenities I needed. It was a bit of a flying visit for my part but the area would have been nice to explore a bit more.
16580,104859520,29/9/16,73006605,Tony,"This was my first AirBnB experience, and I could not have asked for better. Reka's place is in a great location, minutes away from fantastic coffee and a Citibike station (which made for a nice start to every day). Reka is a wonderful host, and knows the area very well. The neighbourhood is full of casual dining options, and she had a recommendation for whatever style of cuisine I could come up with. Every one was a winner! The apartment was clean & tidy and the room well appointed. And that roof deck! Such a great place to relax and reflect with a cold beer after a day of exploring the city. I will definitely stay again if I'm lucky enough to return to the East Village sometime."

The neighborhood is vibrant and all original - lots of restaurants, cafes, funky shops, community gardens and the iconic Thompson Sq Park. I even saw some chickens doing their strut."

My flight was delayed coming in by about 4 hours and the hosts stayed up late to let me in. The room was big with a cool view of The freedom tower.

The apartment is in a quiet area and it has an elevator and laundry. So it's great when moving suitcases and trying to freshen up after a couple of weeks on the road.

In addition, it was always very quiet and private despite I just rented a room. Reka is very warm and friendly and also makes you feel at ease around her.

16580,175296172,28/7/17,98796268,Irsan,"Hello, traveler(s)!

It was my first experience booking and staying through airbnb, although I have experienced it before but my wife did the booking. 

The place was as advertised, clean and Reka was a great host. Communication was excellent and check in and out processes were smooth. 

The apartment is next to Tompkins square park and activities within this park were great! Basketball, ping pong, hanging out even for dogs, and even a live music once. 

Great restaurants and bars near by, so plenty of hangouts nearby. 

Expect 10-15 minutes walk each way to nearest train station. 

If host is not available at location during arrival, expect to possibly pick up keys at alternate location that will require 5-min walk each way. Plan your ride to drop you off at the key location instead of the apartment. Same routine in reverse when checking out. 

Overall, I would return and stay at this place again, if available. 

Happy travel!"
16580,176719555,31/7/17,136695145,Brittany,Great location. Reka gave us really fun recommendations for food in the area. Everything was really easy. I had a phone conference for work and it was great to sit on the roof deck for it!

16580,181934412,13/8/17,12428290,Max,"This apartment comes highly recommended!
Reka is a great host, communication as well as check in were easy and she was really helpful.
The apartment is on the 6th floor, has three bedrooms (two of which are frequently rented via airbnb), and laundry and a small gym are in the house.
The bed is extremely comfortable, the room has more than enough space for all your things and the apartment is spotlessly clean and provides all that you need. Most importantly, the rooftop terrace is amazing and offers a beautiful view over lower Manhattan which rivals many of the rooftop bars in the area.
The neighborhood is lovely with many cafes, bars, and restaurants. Tompkins Square Park and East River Park are just a short walk away."
16580,183580599,17/8/17,139851543,Tara,"Such a fantastic apartment and what a wonderful host! Reka made me feel extremely welcome and at home from the moment I arrived and was incredibly kind and helpful when I needed to find a local medical clinic at the end of my trip, going above and beyond to make sure I was OK. Really couldn't have asked for a better host or a nicer a place to stay for the few days I was in the city! Such a great find and I would recommend to all!"

16580,193442276,13/9/17,1789449,Pancho,"Reka's place is really amazing! Its located in the heart of East Village, just two blocks from Thompkins Square Park. The aerea is surrounden by plenty cool restaurants and bars.
1rst Avenue Subway Station (From the L line) is just ten minute walking and will connect you so fast with williamsburg or midtown of manhattan. If you like to walk, you can also go walking to soho, just fifteen minutes!
The appartment is really nice! My bedroom was very comfortable (really big). Reka lives upstairs and has its own bathroom. So you just share the bathroom with another guest.
The building has elevator, this is awesome! If you are carrying heavy luggage this is amazing!
Reka helped me with some personal stuff, like returning amazon products! Im sorry for using too much tape ahahah! She is very generous and good vibes. 
I definetely come back again to rekas place.

It was presented beautifully and truly felt like a home away from home. We couldn’t believe our luck when we went up to the terrace and had the view of downtown Manhattan skyline and could hear the bustling neighbourhood and the river. There is really nothing we could complain about, the room was hot but equipped with a strong air con machine. We will definitely recommend and hopefully be back!!!"

16580,240348839,4/3/18,88074994,Lauren,"I absolutely loved staying at Reka’s place! It’s located on a very quiet street, just a few feet from Tompkins Square Park. (I did a lot of dog-watching as I walked through). I stayed for one night; and Reka was very lovely and welcoming. I am pretty quiet, so I kept to myself when I was in the apartment. It was very, very clean and so comfortable. The room is a really decent size, and the bed is awesome. She also has a really great selection of books in the room. I couldn’t help but admire all the titles. The view of the city from the window is gorgeous, especially at night, and when I woke up Sunday morning, it was so quiet and peaceful which is super-surprising for being in the city! 

The area is very accessible. I walked about twelve minutes to the L train to head into Brooklyn during the day Saturday; and at night I picked up some awesome pizza at F & F Slice right around the corner, and also visited Ray’s Candy Store on Ave A. Ray is about 90 years old and he made my fried Oreos. A legend. Also check out Death and Co.; an incredible bar about ten min away. There’s so much to do and see within walking distance of the apartment! 

I didn’t drive into the city, but I could’ve. There was plenty of parking in the East Village and it’s so safe. I was alone at night and didn’t feel scared at all. 

If you need a cool, comfortable place to crash; book with Reka. I had to head out early Sunday so I didn’t get the chance to say goodbye and thank you in person; but she was wonderful! (Next time I’ll check out the view from the pretty terrace in the photos!)"
16580,241531580,9/3/18,100803078,Jamstel Ivan,This place is amazing for the price! Love the scenic view of downtown Manhattan right outside my bedroom window. Staying at Reka’s place is an awesome experience 🙌🏻👌🏻

Todo está muy limpio y ella comparte todo lo que hay en su cocina contigo, pero no seas un aprovechado, compra tambien tus cosas cuando vayas. El barrio es tranquilo, seguro y tiene de todo. Si eres joven y te gusta la marcha tendrás dondr elegir. Si te gusta el vino hay unas tiendas estupendas para comprar una buena botella. Ah!

Close to the metro station, restaurants and shops. The rooftop is cute and has a beautiful view! Overall a great stay and highly recommend Reka’s place!"
16580,286155898,5/7/18,24055072,Becky,Reka's place is in a great location for exploring NYC. She was able to accommodate a very early check in and had some great local tips too. I would stay here again.
16580,287078334,7/7/18,199785602,Harry,"Clean, comfortable, funky - what more could you want? Fabulous and lovely host, good location. Would stay again and heartily recommend. "
16580,287776008,8/7/18,3138189,John,A wonderful space. Books line the walls in this truly lovely apartment. Checking in was very easy and she was extremely accommodating. I stay at a lot of air BnB and this was one of the nicest. She clearly cares about the space and the people who stay there.
16580,289134646,11/7/18,16057925,Bonnie,"Reka's place is great. It is clean, comfortable and I love the neighborhood. I highly recommend her place as a good place to stay in NYC. The only downside to it was that it was more communal than I was expecting, but this was TOTALLY my fault for not reading the description correctly. She makes this very clear in the listing. I am only pointing this out in case other people are as careless in reading the details as I was. At my age I prefer a bit more privacy. Overall I loved the place and Reka is lovely."
16580,292712180,18/7/18,186145905,Jo,"Apartment was beautiful! Gorgeous, lush house plants and super clean. Terrece had an amazing view, lovely plants and even a couple of small trees. The other bedroom  on the lower level was also an air bnb room. Great location. "
16580,296315168,25/7/18,12294070,Barbara,Reka’s apartment is perfectly located for exploring East  Village and Manhattan. It’s spotlessly clean and well equipped. 
16580,299210866,30/7/18,188722862,Randall,"Beautiful place with sunshine, plants and a fantastic patio with a view of Lower Manhattan."
16580,300187881,1/8/18,75422189,Rachael,"Gr8 location, bus routes 1 min and subway 10 min walk. Reka is a thoughtful host and very welcoming. Highly recommend."
16580,302483737,5/8/18,156372724,Ira,"When you go to NYC, you’ll want to find a place that’s conveniently located but won’t break the bank.  We found that and more with Reka.  She was a great host. VERY helpful with advice and tips for us on our very first trip to NYC. 
 
Sure the room is small, but the bed was very comfortable and the A/C blew hard and cold.  Sharing the common space and bathroom with the other room's guests was not a big deal.  In fact, I enjoyed having others there with which we could compare ideas and opinions on what to see when and how.  

After my first trip to NYC I can truly say, “I love NY” and Reka and her little room helped make that true!
"
16580,303563932,7/8/18,56499256,Andrea,"Great place to stay, Reka is very nice and hospitable."
16580,304991318,10/8/18,93666619,John,"A clean home with a comfortable bed. Host gave me all necessary and relevant instructions for arrival and departure, making the process free of anxiety. "
16580,309708216,18/8/18,13483521,Thomas,Would definitely recommend staying here 
16595,128084,26/10/10,240039,Nikki,Daniel is wonderful and so was his place. The neighborhood was very quiet and is a great place if you have some work to do. If you have an issue or a problem Daniel will get back to you quickly and he is very considerate.
16595,132538,2/11/10,265388,Sian,"Daniel has a great place in a superb spot in Williamsburg (a fantastic suburb!) - his place is very cozy, yet roomy and stylishly laid out with all the amenities we could need. Daniel himself was very helpful, informative and friendly, we very much enjoyed our stay and would highly recommended to all!!"
16595,150303,7/12/10,281413,Cristina,"Excelente mi primera experiencia con Airbnb.Daniel es un anfitrión genial,pendiente de nuestras necesidades y que acudió enseguida que lo necesitamos por algún problema en el uso de a (Website hidden by Airbnb) casa era exactamente como se describía y Daniel la ha decorado de una manera muy acogedora y agradable,tiene muy buena energía.Además me encantó la escalera de incendios,donde se puede salir a charlar o a respirar aire fresco (bien abrigado por supuesto).
En cuanto al barrio ,para mí es otro de los puntos fuertes;  nos encantó Williamsburg (lleno de bares y locales con música en directo) y la gente que se movía por allá.Además está supercerca de Manhattan (a sólo una parada de metro del Lower East Village) y puedes desplazarte fácilmente en taxi (unos 7 dólares hasta el East Village).Seguramente me quedaré toda la estancia en esta zona la próxima vez que vuelva a NY ,ya que esta vez partimos nuestra estancia entre Brooklyn y East Village.
Sólo un dato como comentario , la escalera del edificio es bastante vieja y puede dar una fasa impresión sobre la casa al principio.Recomiendo esperar hasta ver la casa para poder emitir un juicio,ya que no tiene nada que ver con el estado del edifio.

Me ha encantado mi experiencia en Williamsburg,la hemos disfrutado mucho."
16595,186974,22/2/11,356281,Sarah,"My parents stayed at Daniel's place during their weekend visit to NYC.  The apartment was lovely and serene, and Daniel was accommodating and easy-going. I'd recommend Daniel's apartment to anyone looking for a place to stay in Williamsburg!"
16595,223919,11/4/11,62881,Sanjay,"Daniel's place was perfect and right where we wanted to be in Brooklyn. His apt. is nicely put together and had a great atmosphere. His attention to detail can't be missed. Daniel was very easy to work with and I'm glad everything worked out. Lots of bars, restaurants and shops in close proximity. Highly recommend his loft for a great NYC experience. "
16595,230976,18/4/11,1039,Darren,"Daniel has a beautiful apartment in a fantastic location. I live in the area and had a group of visiting friends stay there. We spent the entire weekend within walking distance of the apartment and had a blast. Breakfast at Pies-n-Thighs and Rabbit Hole, Stumptown coffee at Marlowe & Sons, lunch at Fette Sau, dinner at Traif, beer and bratwurst at Radegast, bowling at Brooklyn Bowl, and so much more we didn't have time for. I highly recommend staying here."
16595,240606,26/4/11,390950,Vanessa,"We've spent a wonderful week at Daniel's place ! The apartment is really nice, cozy and comfortable. You will feel at home. The neighborhood is quiet and close to a lot of nice bars and restaurants. And Daniel is very friendly. 
We highly recommend Daniel's place !"
16595,269515,18/5/11,114756,Daniel,"Place was great, just like on the pics.
Daniel was really nice, we had a problem with the Wifi, but He addressed the issue promptly which was great.
I would definitely recommend the place to other people."
16595,271488,19/5/11,596262,Catherine,Great apartment. Very helpful owner. We needed something last minute and it all came together.
16595,273953,21/5/11,583790,Gregory,"Daniel was great. He was helpful and a good communicator. His apartment is beautiful apartment, just as the pictures show and the location is fantastic, close to lots of great bars and restaurants. I would stay again. "
16595,277893,23/5/11,593881,Jan,Daniel’s place was quite cozy and looks like the pics. I’d recommend his place if ur in the area. It’s pretty close to some good eats like pies and thighs and the Brooklyn flea market/smorgasbord. The neighbourhood is pretty safe too. Subway is about a 10 minute walk to the closest one and the stairs are creaky but still a great spot. I'd book his loft again.
16595,289164,30/5/11,428135,Jon,"Daniel was a great host.  The loft was just as advertised.  Very clean, sunny, spacious and a great location.  I would love to stay there again. "
16595,303085,7/6/11,628341,Artyom,"Very nice apartment in very hip, trendy neighborhood. Clean, sunny, stylish, 5-7 minutes walk to Bedford Avenue, and about 20-25 min by metro to 42nd Street. 

Might be very hot during the summer months, but Daniel (the host) is planning to install AC. 

Daniel was very helpful and responded very fast to all enquires.

If I'll travel to NY in the nearest future, I'll definitely try to book this apartment again. 

"
16595,306183,9/6/11,624458,Rex,"Daniel's place was perfect!  Great location and cozy little apartment (even had some beers and munchies for my consumption after a late flight in from Chicago).

Getting into the place was a cinch and Daniel was super responsive even when, at the last minute, I needed to stay an extra night.  Would definitely stay here again.  "
16595,321201,18/6/11,674311,Selim,"thanks for making our stay happen last minute!
nice place, good neighbourhood & excellent restautants & cafe's nearby.
& now with aitconditioning! :)"
16595,366614,11/7/11,722663,Stephen,"Daniel's pad is a well-polished gem buried beyond a gritty street-front and crumbling hallway.  

Four of us spent three nights in scorching July, but with a window AC unit humming it was a comfortable launching point for both Brooklyn and Manhattan.  There's an unassuming diner with top-notch fare around the corner and  Marcy station is a five-minute walk away. 

Daniel himself is a great absentee host, setting up an easy check-in/check-out system and responding quickly to any questions or concerns.  He even offered a discount after an issue with the deadbolt necessitated a visit from a locksmith.  

Highly recommended."
16595,381977,18/7/11,789791,Armen,I was very happy with the service and communication by Daniel.  The apartment is very clean and spacious by New York standards.  Checking in and checking out was very easy.  Highly recommend dealing with Daniel.
16595,388057,21/7/11,821979,Megan,"I enjoyed my stay!  Clear communication from Daniel, who was quick to respond to all inquiries and it's a great place. "
16595,412365,1/8/11,704600,Helena,I just loved Daniel´s place! Wouldn´t hesitate to go again.
16595,457897,19/8/11,306802,Leah,"Great place - comfortable, close to a couple of subways (L and J / M) and nice places to eat and grab coffee. Daniel was helpful and friendly too. I'd recommend it."
16595,520211,11/9/11,798483,Hana,"Daniel was the perfect host, very flexible and really went out of his way to make our stay as good as possible! The apartment is fantastic with air-condition and everything. Close to both restaurants and subway. Highly recommended!"
16595,528719,13/9/11,25539,Daniel,"Daniel is such an amazing guy. He helped with everything about the apartment, with fast answers and flexible terms.

Needed to check-in a little bit earlier than the combined, and there was no problem for him.

There's a cafe near called ""Marlow & Sons"" that is totally incredible. The train is also near. Great localization and neighborhood.

The apartment is pretty exactly the pictures, the only thing to tell about it is the stairs of the building, that are kinda old.

If I visit NYC again, I'd totally stay again at his place.

Everything was amazing."
16595,537723,16/9/11,271909,Nathan,"Very sunny and spacious, good communication from Daniel and an easy check in and out process. Pretty good location, a short walk to the JMZ stops and easy stroll into the main part of Williamsburg. It worked well for us as one couple and a friend we had the bedroom and the third person had a bed in the main space. The desk by the window is a good spot to work from. "
16595,564119,24/9/11,1166409,Olga,Everithing was  very good!!!
16595,623110,12/10/11,1006258,Luvi,this was my first experience with AirBnB and it was a great one!
16595,632878,16/10/11,1216888,Oliver,Good experience overall.  Daniel is responsive and the getting the keys and getting into the loft went off without a hitch. Easy walk to the subway stop.
16595,654418,23/10/11,941526,Stefan,"It's just a great place after you managed to get around the staircase. And Daniel is fast and perfect in addressing all the questions we had. One important note: make use of the Northside Luxury Taxi Service as it is reliable, cheap and comfortable."
16595,668740,27/10/11,1190706,Alizabeth,Everything was as advertised! We had a great stay.... Very easy process. 
16595,691572,4/11/11,1265411,Heidi,"Unfortunately when we arrived at 4pm on Halloween the apartment hadn't been cleaned despite the fact that I had confirmed my arrival and was told that the cleaner would be there from 12-3pm that day. The apartment had been inhabited by a group of very messy people who left a lot of rubbish, mess and wet towels on the bathroom floor and the smell wasn't very pleasant. When I contacted Daniel he responded immediately and sent the cleaner over to the apartment. She started while we were dressing up to go out amongst all the mess and took the laundry. When we arrived home later that night the apartment was in order. They said it was a mistake and hadn't happened before. I asked for the cleaning fee to be refunded to me and Daniel agreed. So, I was happy with how Daniel dealt with the situation but it was not such a good stay for us because of what happened and I felt it was a bit over-priced. Also the neighbours upstairs thumped around a lot."
16595,713655,13/11/11,1287181,Ørjan,"Very nice appartment, just as described. Daniel was very responsive and quickly answered any question by e-mail. It was a treat to return to this nice loft after a long day out. Little noise and no problem to sleep with the bedroom window open. 

The neighbourhood is lively, fun and safe. Manhattan is very easy accessible through the bedford avn and Marcy st Metro stations some minutes walk away. We rented bikes for a day at the bike shop in bedford avn. just after the bridge, brought them with us on the east ferry and had a nice ride along the Hudson river to Central park and then across Manhattan to east river and Williamsburg. Recommended.

"
16595,780341,12/12/11,1449730,Monique,"Daniel was amazing to work with!  He is quick at returning emails and was happy to answer all of my questions before I booked his apartment.  His space is immaculately clean and has tons of room to spread out and feel at home away from home. 

The thing that that most impressed me is Daniel's laid back attitude; during our stay a lamp was broken.  He was very quick to let us know the cost for replacement and was understanding about the situation.

Wonderful place to stay in Williamsburg!"
16595,878479,23/1/12,984793,Shannon,"Daniel's Loft suited us well.  As two professionals in the city for meetings and doing some work from ""home"" the space and location was perfect.  We loved trying a new restaurant for every meal - too many to choose from in Williamsburg and made use of the very efficient kitchen to cook in a couple of times.  

The loft is an easy metro ride or drive to Manhattan and a quick walk to trendy Bedford Ave. Easy from JFK and even closer to La Guardia airports.  

I hope to stay here again and would certainly recommend to friends and/or family. "
16595,883038,25/1/12,1005355,Natalya,"I enjoyed my stay at Daniel's apartment. It has a lot of style: the antique unique furniture and light fixtures, the brick wall, comfortable kitchen, beautiful middle eastern rugs, a library... Everything about it tells of the rare and unique opportunity of staying at one of the hippest places you've ever visited -of Williamsburg Brooklyn."
16595,964095,2/3/12,1619511,Aurora,Daniel was a great and very responsive host. The pictures of his place are identical to what it looks like in person.
16595,1025589,20/3/12,1839592,Rebecca,"Daniel's apartment was everything we could have wished for on our trip! The apartment was really well equipped and finished to a very high standard- some lovely art books and mags were lovely finishing touches. The beds were comfy, linen- fresh and towels fluffy- GREAT to not have all this here and ready for us on arrival. Milk, teas and coffees were much appreciated after our long journey and the kitchen had everything we needed... a total luxury! The bathroom was clean and I will truly miss the fabulous shower!  

The location was excellent... right by the Williamsburg bridge and only a couple minus walk from Bedford Avenue.  The area was safe, and felt like a second home to us.  We are hoping to return as soon as we can and this would certainly be my first port of call.  Staying in Brooklyn felt like we were part of a community and we were only a couple of stops on the Metro from Manhattan.  Absolutely perfect!

Many Thanks to Daniel and for making us feel so at home!  We hope to see you again soon.

16595,1148632,18/4/12,1931346,Michelle,love the loft! everything was easy no hassles...
16595,1175641,24/4/12,345418,Lauren,"Daniel's place was perfect for me and my four friends. It's location couldn't be better; it's halfway between the Marcy and Bedford subway stations, giving you easy access to the L, J and M lines running to Manhattan. Secondly, Marlow & Sons and Diner are just around the corner and offer some of the best elevated casual fare in Williamsburg. If you're into shopping, there's plenty just around the corner--namely, Brookfarm General Store and Hickoree's--and even more closer to the main drag of Bedford Ave. Daniel was a very communicative and accomodating host. It was important for us to check in early and slightly late and Daniel worked with us both times to make that happen--thanks! As for the apartment itself, it's clean and lovely. To be honest, we didn't spend much time there, but what time we did was very much enjoyed."
16595,1331498,22/5/12,37290,Mimi Marianne,"The place was very nice, simple to access, perfect neighborhood, and the communication with Daniel was very easy too.

16595,2519784,6/10/12,3059627,Naama,"Daniel's apartment in Williamsburg is beautiful, clean and welcoming, loved the decor, the beds were all comfortable and the kitchen well equipped for the few family meals we decided to prepare when the kids got tired of french fries... A big plus is the location - close to nice deli's, bars and groceries yet still quiet enough a neighborhood, not too far from the bus and subway. Unfortunately we did not get to meet Daniel, though our few phone calls were pleasant, and when we experienced some difficulties with the internet it was solved immediately. A perfect home away from home for us!
This was also our first encounter with airbnb - and it was quite nice!"

Daniel himself is helpful and was very responsive and quickly answered any question by e-mail."
16595,4428832,5/5/13,5114134,Neda,"Daniel's place was absolutely perfect, we were five girls staying for a total of 9 night. The apartement was spacious, clean and a big part of making our New York experience complete. We were provided with enough towels for all of us and the beds were comfy. 

Daniel was overall a perfect host, also big thanks to Christine who helped us find our way aound the area. Would highly recommend this apartement, the location is really good, close to downtown manhattan and close to the heart of Williamsburg.

We would definetly stay there again!"

One small thing to note: the bedroom gets slightly stuffy when the summer humidity and heat get up. The windows and breeze are great otherwise. And there's always the A/C unit."

"
16595,6403194,11/8/13,1575112,Sabine,"Daniel's loft is a great place to plan and start your NY visit from. It is furnitured with a lot of love for details and antiques. The kids enjoyed sitting at the front window and watching traffic go by. It was great to have a table seating all of us for dinner and breakfast. We did not get in touch with Daniel, but everything (keys, Wi-FI access etc.) was well prepared. The area is the ""cooler part"" of W-burg including great restaurants around the corner as well as dirt and trash on the streets. "
16595,6551702,16/8/13,5452596,Samira,"Daniel's apartment was great. Nice and breezy, beautifully furnished and in a great location for exploring.  Caught the Brooklyn Brewery tour and used the City Bikes to ride into Manhattan over the Williamsburg bridge and return via the Brooklyn bridge. Thanks for coming thru when another AirBnber failed us."
16595,6625765,19/8/13,2562986,Andrea,"Daniel's place was wonderful.  Tastefully appointed, easy to access, comfortable. It's near well-reviewed restaurants like Diner and Marlow & Sons, and a great cup of coffee can be had just up the street at Gourmet Guild. A ten minute walk to the subway makes it easy to zip into the city. Great experience, overall. "

You find yourself right close to the waterfront facing Manhattan without all the noise and trouble you might want to escape after your long days. Nice restaurants and coffee places in easy walking distance and -what we appreciated very much -the east-river ferry boats leaving just around the corner from Daniels apartment. Although very close to Williamsburg bridge, it´s amazingly quiet. And nicely furbished, easy to feel comfortable and home here. I guess we will be back ! "
16595,8106287,15/10/13,5245053,Melanie,"We loved staying in Daniel's loft. It is so nicely decorated, clean and was very comfortable.

16595,8373321,28/10/13,8916408,Rosemary,"I have just returned from staying in this flat for 9 days, we really enjoyed our time there.  It was very well equipped, clean and homely.  Also well placed for the subway, two stations within easy reach.  The local shops and restaurants were also an easy stroll away.  The East River ferry stopped 2 minutes walk away.  It was lovely to come home to after a hectic day on Manhattan and I would definitely recommend it."
16595,9635628,4/1/14,9173452,Helen,"Daniel's loft was a lovely place to stay for my family. We had plenty of room and only a short walk to the subway. There were some good eating places close by and we felt very secure in the apartment. The only downside is the lack of laundry facilities in the apartment, however a laundromat was only a short walk.

16595,20847422,6/10/14,18493415,Michel,"We enjoyed our stay very much.
The apartment is compact but fine for our family of four. Loved the way that every ounce of space was used to advantage & the location was perfect for exploring the area. We all loved Williamsburg with its small bars & galleries. The apartment was just as the pics showed & lived up to our expectations. We would definitely stay here again, so thank you Daniel. It was hard to leave."

The apartment is as shown in the pictures, it is clean and warm. It is well positioned very close to the J and M train station and 10/15 minute walk far from the L station if you want to visit Manhattan. It is also near the nicest restaurants and cafes in the neighborhood, which is very safe. I was there with two friends and the apartment was perfect for us with three separate beds arranged between the bedroom and the living room. I would definitely stay here again. "
16595,33157882,25/5/15,1106539,Arlton,I had a great time staying at Daniel's Airbnb. The location was great and there was a grocery store and plenty of restaurants in the neighborhood.
16595,33629295,30/5/15,273455,Stu,Extremely fast response to a last minute request from me to stay. Daniel was flexible with the check in time and everything was as it was described. Very clear instructions about the apartment which is great. The place is close to some great restaurants and bars and right where I wanted to be. 
16595,36906762,2/7/15,36082072,Adi,As advertised. In excellent part of town. Close to some good joints. A short hop over to Manhattan. Nicely appointed. Will stay again.
16595,39073217,20/7/15,1886139,Gabrael,"Daniels Apartment was Amazing!!!! Plenty of space, lots of hot water and really nice neighbors. The place was really clean and populated with great vintage furnishings. AC worked perfectly on the extremely hot NYC days i was there. The breeze coming from the windows on both sides of the apartment was enough to cool down the place in minutes after being closed up all day as well. Its close proximity to the Subway made it really easy to get in and out of the city and the shops and restaurants in the neighborhood are some of the best in Williamsburg. 
Try the Dodge City Salami at Marlow and Daughters. "
16595,41017940,3/8/15,4739688,Dustin,"This was an amazing find! I had to find a place last minute due to an unexpected cancellation, and Daniel was incredibly responsive.

The apartment is in a great part of town, walking distance to restaurants, bars, markets and the subway. There was plenty of space and it was very charming. Daniel provided a thorough guide to the space (how to get the keys, info about check-out, etc.), which was very helpful and appreciated.

My only complaints were really out of Daniel's hands: the weather was really, really hot, and the apartment took a while to cool down from the small A/C unit, and the WiFi was extremely spotty, often not working at all (Daniel contacted the cable company, and they said they had an outage, but it never resolved).

Other than that, I would absolutely stay here again — amazing find!"
16595,42180862,11/8/15,16766100,Simon,Not much to say other than the Apartment was great. Just as petty as the pictures and excellent location - was so easy just to stroll down to the best places in Williamsburg. Do. It. 
16595,44464235,26/8/15,33546577,Luke,Daniels very quick to respond to mails. The apartment is in a great location for restaurants and bars. Do a right and head right along Wythe and your all set for the evening. Its an easy hop over to Manhattan on the ferry. I would recommend this for a short break in NYC. 
16595,46532024,11/9/15,5023078,Toby,"This place was so charming and really treated us with love. Daniel is a joy and very helpful, he was very ready to help me when I had some things to sort out. Thank you Dan! "
16595,47113047,15/9/15,11095309,Dan,"Daniel's place is beautiful and really well taken care of.  He was quick with communication and the AirBnB pictures and description were very accurate - the space actually seemed a little bigger in person.  We were really comfortable with 3 people and the AC worked great when it was too hot for open windows.  The location was nice, practically under the Williamsburg bridge, which is unique in a good way (and it's far enough that you don't hear any traffic).  The neighbourhood seemed really safe at all hours and had cool cafes and bars nearby.

Recommended.  We were all really happy there!

Thanks Daniel."
16595,47724542,21/9/15,3100115,Annie,Had an awesome stay at Daniels apartment. There was 3 of us comfortably living there for 5 days. We never met Daniel in person but he was on email if ever we needed anything and checking in was really simple. The apartment is exactly as it looks in the pictures and reads in description (Stunning). Williamsburg I would say is the best place to stay in NY and the flat is positioned close to the subway and within walking distance to all the local coffee shops/ bars/ restaurants and retail shops. I can also say the neighbourhood is very safe. If I had to say a negative about the venue it would have to be the fact it didn't have an elevator but lucky for me I was with 2 strong men otherwise I wouldn't have managed to get my huge suitcase up 2 flights of stairs. Other than that we had a great time and would highly recommend staying here and would definitely stay again. :) 
16595,48745384,28/9/15,32669381,Matt,"We booked Daniel's Williamsburg apartment for 4 nights.  It is very conveniently about a 10 minute walk to the subway.  Lots of good restaurants and coffee shops close by.  Felt safe walking around at night.  The view of Manhattan from the river was awesome.  

The apartment was very nice.  We felt like we were coming ""home"" after a long day of walking around the city.  It has all of the creature comforts you might want and was nice for just hanging out around the kitchen table.  The beds were a little hard for our tastes, but it wasn't horrible.  

To get to the apartment on the third floor, you do have to walk up two flights of pretty narrow stairs, but it's New York, that's to be expected. 

Overall, great, convenient, clean, and welcoming.  Check in was super easy and the House Manual is very specific as to how the apartment should be maintained and left when checking out.  

Thanks for a good week in NY, Daniel!  

"
16595,51046578,17/10/15,16676805,Ingelise,We had a great stay in Daniel’s charming apartment. Loved the neighborhood. Great places for food nearby and the East River Ferry took us straight to Manhattan!
16595,51782503,24/10/15,14885960,Alison,Daniel's apartment was perfect for our stay. It was exactly as pictured and in a lovely location. Plenty of space for our group of 3 and Daniel made it very easy for checking in and out and was very quick in responding to any communications. 
16595,53006372,3/11/15,2714549,Stephanie,"Although we did not met, Daniel was super reactive and it was easy to access the appart even landing late. Convenient location. Convenient appartment well described. We get what we rented. Thanks "
16595,53208076,6/11/15,44714305,Traci,My stay at Daniel's place was enjoyable. The apartment was much larger than I expected. A very walkable neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants nearby. I recommend checking out the Urban Market around the corner on Broadway. Easy access to lower Manhattan via the East River Ferry (5 minute walk).
16595,54986913,27/11/15,44751953,Kendall,"Daniel was a very welcoming and responsive host. Guidelines were easy enough to follow.

The apartment was generally as described and depicted, though the building exterior/stairwells are in generally poor condition. The interior was clean, tidy and functional. The shower/tub is very small, to the point that you stick to the sides of the shower curtain while showering. Overall, though, the space is very livable and comfortable. 

As of this writing, there is also construction ongoing in the adjacent building which creates heavy worker traffic on the street. 

The neighborhood is very cool -- sits right on the southern edge of Williamsburg -- so heading south lands you in Hasidic neighborhoods and heading north or east outs you smack into trendy 'burg country with countless shops/restaurants/bars within easy walking distance.

I would have really enjoyed my stay here overall much more, however, if it weren't for a major problem with the upstairs neighbors and their noise level. It is very loud, obnoxious and constant. Daniel is very aware of the issue, and has assured me that he rectifying the problem -- as it is apparently a new problem - but I would be remiss to not mention it as it directly and negatively impacted the enjoyment of my stay.

If you are here to work, or you need to rest/sleep during normal hours, please check w Daniel to make sure this problem is not ongoing.

My trip ended up concluding earlier than expected, and Daniel was kind enough to refund my unused portion of the trip to me in full, which I really appreciated.

In summary -- positives: great host, cool location, fun neighborhood, comfortable quarters; negatives: busy construction area, obnoxious neighbors."
16595,56970390,20/12/15,13164279,Yaniv,Cosy elegant stay in Williamsburg. pretty close to anything you'd need in a quiet part of the neighberhood.
16595,60071204,18/1/16,34205819,Thomas,"Our apt location was excellent, very near restaurants and other other Williamsburg sites.  The apt was cozy and exactly as described by Daniel.  The hallway and stairs are pretty rundown as is common in these older buildings, but the apt was a great place to unwind after a busy day.  We felt very safe in the neighborhood, day and night.  I would recommend Daniels place when looking for a great Williamsburg location! "
16595,61238832,1/2/16,5230182,Matthew,"A short walk from the J and M. Check-in was set up very conveniently, could do it at any time without bothering the host, which I appreciated. 

It's a very nice, well-decorated space to relax in with tall ceilings. The walls are a little thin, but I would definitely stay in again.

Stayed for 5 nights."

16595,61917467,9/2/16,8062325,Conor,Loved this place just south of the Williamsburg Bridge. Proper warehouse feel and put together with love and taste by Daniel. The neighbourhood doesn't need any explanation probably and links to Manhattan and other parts of the city are great. All communications from Daniel were prompt and chilled. Highly recommended.
16595,63028492,19/2/16,38017869,Paul,"This is a good spacious ""loft"" style place.  Handy location for Williamsburg. It's clean and characterful and Daniel was helpful.
A great spot if Williamsburg is your preferred destination.
"
16595,73932791,11/5/16,22810146,Johanna,"Daniel was a very nice and informative host. We felt very welcome with clear instructions of how to manage get into the building. It felt safe and easy. The apartment was clean and silent, close to nice bars and shops in Williamsburg. It was really easy to catch the train into Manhattan and also further out in Brooklyn.
We also loved the food court down the road, with very fresh and nice offers!

Thanks for a nice stay!"
16595,86434908,16/7/16,5890179,Rafał,"Daniel was very responsive and had us over on very short notice. As described multiple times the neighborhood is great with its hip bars and restaurants (there's even a Michelin rated one - Delaware and Hudson). The apartment is located two minutes away from a ferry which is very convenient to go to lower Manhattan (great views of the Brooklyn bridge) and a 10 minutes walk to the metro line M.
The apartment itself looks as on the pictures, it's very charming and spacious  however during summer the temperature is u-n-b-e-a-r-a-b-l-e, especially in the bedroom area as the AC is on the other side of the apartment. Apart from that it's  good value for money."
16595,89030645,26/7/16,5865163,Rose,"Great apartment, exactly as described. Would visit again"
16595,91586436,6/8/16,30880278,Sam,Place is really kept well and exactly as the photos show.  Daniel was very helpful and always would get back to messages very promptly.  I'd definitely recommend anyone to stay at this place.  
16595,92191613,7/8/16,86591230,Winter,nice cozy place in a great locale.  will be on my wish list for next trip.  
16595,93856253,14/8/16,8854630,Osvaldo,"Beautiful place. Tasteful, welcoming. A pleasure to be there. Great supermarket only a block away. Nice neighborhood near the river. Daniel was helpful and clear. Only drawbacks are the building's rundown narrow stairs (but you forget them as soon as you enter the loft) and only one AC unit. We happened to be there in extremely hot and humid days in August and took a while to bring the temperature down. All in all we had a fantastic time. Would definitely come back. "
16595,99953310,6/9/16,26423585,Theo,"A charming apartment, Very satisfied with my stay. Daniel was a great host assertive and quick with responding to queries. 

The space consisted of an organically vintage stylised work/living area and all amenities  were included. 

The area was as close to Williamsburg bride as they come. I enjoyed the local supermarket aswell as Bedford ave as a whole. 

My baby niece hung out during the day and was easily entertained in her self made bed sheet tent whilst watching cartoons on the projector. 

Would defiantly recommend this apartment. Ps make sure you do your dishes, do not move anything around  & check to see if there are stains anywhere before resting up, to avoid a bad review x

The place is an oasis in a rather hectic city and the location for me was perfection. Yoga, restaurants, shops, wine store, grocery and on and on. Stay here you wont regret it. The style of the home and the size for the location are unbeatable."

16595,191446305,7/9/17,22991154,Ben,"This apartment is a well-furshished loft with cute Mid-Century-Modern furniture. It's a big place. I stayed by myself and felt it was very spacious. I didn't get a chance to use the projector. There is a bit of noise from the street but I've lived elsewhere in the city so it didn't bother me. I appreciated the dining table where I could work. 

Bathroom and shower are fine, no complaints. Check-in was quite easy.  Great place for a couple or a couple plus one."

Was the perfect location for the interview we filmed in the bright kitchen. Daniel was so amenable to us and our schedule and was a quick communicator - we were able to book the space in an hour after requesting. It was also very easy to get into the apartment.
For a shoot, this is a gorgeous space with ample room and beautiful light. For a stay, you can't find a better location in Brooklyn for this price! Highly recommend. Thank you Daniel!"
16595,258779391,29/4/18,182496234,Holly,Amazing communication with Daniel! I booked on behalf of my partner who said it was an absolutely fantastic place in the best location for them. A brilliant place for a weekend getaway! Highly recommend.
16595,283738032,30/6/18,4001149,Joanne,"We loved our stay in this little nook in Williamsburg. Beautifully decorated by someone with a very artistic eye. We wanted an “authentic” Brooklyn experience and this place delivered. The location is fabulous and we walked around the neighborhood a lot. The Kitchen is well equipped (we cook most of our own food) and there were a lot of comfortable furniture all over the place!

A couple notes: two flights of stairs so if you have a lot of luggage, start working on those bicep curls now. 

Also, the AC only cools a portion of the house and when it gets hot outside... well, it’s not always the most chill place. That said, it only got uncomfortable when it was 90+ degrees outside. 

Wonderful experience overall and Daniel was very friendly and nice!"
16595,292312799,17/7/18,30698861,Thorsten,"Daniel was very fast in answering any question and  a great help. 
The location his apartment is amazing as Manhattan is easy reachable via the eat river ferry or via subway. Williamsburg is a very nice place with plenty of restaurants. The Domino Park is just around the corner, the sunsets are unbelievable.
The Apartment is very clean and everything you need you will find. I was there with my son age 17 and we had plenty of space what we liked. 
The interieor of the apparent is amazing and just a great style. 
I can highly recommend to book this place as everything is perfect, location as well as the Apartment."

The decor and layout of the space is so unique and interesting - I honestly feel inspired to buy myself some wooden plant hangers. Not only was it beautiful, it was functional. The space has all the amenities you could need for making food, watching TV, working from the listing. The beds are firm, but comfy. The AC works well, but it’s always a battle against the NY summer heat. This is a great place for close friends, a family, or a couple. We would definitely come again! Thanks, Daniel! "

Last but not least I stayed in mid summer and the portable aircon unit was not really up to the task, but I suspect I just got unlucky to be there in the hottest couple of weeks. 

It’s a good place to stay, in a great area and close to manhattan if you need it. Ideal for short trips. "

The area couldn't be better, right in the heart of the east village with amazing shops, cafes, bars and really easy to get the subway anywhere. Boardwalk empire was being filmed on the street outside on the day I left and the night before a roof-top party complete with Chinese lanterns was happening upstairs. 

Casey is also lovely and helpful and the non-profit he runs from the living room (with lovely ladies who fed me pasta upon arrival) is totally cool too.

A wonderful apartment in a wonderful area with wonderful people. Can't get much better so thanks!

Casey spontaneously left me his room. So I stayed with his roommates, which are very cordial people. They didn't only direct me to the best coffee place in the neighbourhood, but even invited me to join a BBQ party. The appartment is big in size, decorated with style, and clean. Casey's room with a very comfortable bed gives to 4th street, so you have a bit of street noise in the night. But I didn't expect anything else in the centre of the city. 
Highly recommanded."

We visited the bar next door a couple times and felt like a local (check out Dorian Gray!) The subway was a quick 5 minute walk next to many connections. Lots of good restaurants, bars, and coffee shops around, and all in all we were very happy we were able to experience Casey's home on the lower east side. "

The Apartment is really close to subway as well as to difference Kind of restaurants that are situated right next to it. Due to the fact that it is in the center if manhattan, sometimes at night is a little bit loud therefore brining ear plugs might be helpful. About the room itself, I have to say that I thought that it would be a little big bigger than in the pictures however it
Didn't bother me and my gf due to the fact that we were spending whole days outside of the apartment . The only thing which we did not like was the amount of dust on shells and tables in the room . Also the bathroom wasn't as clean ( especially the shower ) "

16821,23718630,8/12/14,24128996,Valerio,Very great room in a wonderfull part of NY. I just saw Casey at my arrival but he was very kind and helpfull before and after.
16821,28492199,24/3/15,1332701,Gillian,"Casey was really easy and helpful to communicate with, even though I came in on a late flight the keys were there ready for me to pick up. The apt is in a great location in the village and the neighbourhood is safe. Apt was large and warm, room was a good size and bed really comfortable, good shower. Genuine good Airbnb experience - would recommend."
16821,31910136,11/5/15,30765840,Sébastien,"Great location, great room, did'nt meet Casey because he was away but I felt welcome by his (Hidden by Airbnb) . I would recommend the place!"
16821,35304785,17/6/15,31995046,James,"The Room was good, quite large with a great bed, kitchen was nice and relatively tidy, freedom to use the cooking utensils was ideal.
The housemates where nice and kind, but also very much to themselves so it didn't feel like I was getting in the way of them all the time.
The door to the whole apartment complex was quite tricky to get into I found, and the lock on the main door took a few goes to get right."
16821,37612983,8/7/15,36906613,Teodoro,"Casey house e' fantastica e nonostante non abbia conosciuto Casey, abbiamo conosciuto Elen, con cui siamo stati super bene. East village e' un bel quartiere, tranquillo e con bella gente. Insomma, se decidete di vneire da queste parti, passate da Casey!"
16821,41635498,8/8/15,37539026,Francesco,"Amazing time in NY! Room and flat are very cozy! I met Casey the last day I was there, he's very friendly. We have spoken a little bit in Italian too! It was nice :) The neighbourhood is fantastic: full of restaurants, pub, shops! Full of life! I recommend you this place!"
16821,46464534,11/9/15,11698759,Micke,"I really enjoyed staying at Caseys place. Clean, big and comfortable at an reasonable price. Lovely neighbourhood with lots of restaurants, bars, shops, Delis and whatever you need. Even an 24/7 food market close by. Didnt meet Casey until the very last day of my vacation but he was friendly, helpful and very laidback.
Also met his lovely roommates who where very friendly. 
Would definitively recommend anyone to stay there.

16821,77605441,2/6/16,19168138,Erin,"Staying at Casey's place is great! It's in a nice neighborhood with plenty of restaurant and bar selection. The roommate of his are quiet and nice. The room is pretty spacious with everything that I needed. Casey is super helpful, although he's not around but he would still text you to make sure everything is alright. "
16821,78698209,8/6/16,9495311,Mervi,"Ok kämppä, ei super. Hyvää: huoneessa ovi paloportaille (voi tuulettaa, koska ei koneellista ilmastointia), hyvin toimiva wifi ja kiva ympäristö 24-h kauppoineen. Huonoa: likaiset suihkutilat ja sängyssä vanhat (hikiläikkäiset) tyynyt.
En nähnyt Caseya, viestittely tekstareilla sujui hyvin."
16821,84090401,5/7/16,29340660,Adil,"Great guy and host. The apartment was perfect and in the heart of east village, with so much on offer.

Definitely recommend"
16821,90842102,2/8/16,10738662,Samantha,"This place is special. From the expansive living and outdoor areas (rooftop has an incredibly romantic nyc view) to the art work and friendly (Website hidden by Airbnb) definitely a rare find in the heart of the village. There's no A/C yet place has good air flow. Bed is super comfy. Bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper. 

Casey has a lovely way. He was warm, welcoming and responsive. The location is perfect - walking distance to everything. And a terrific wine bar ""Bibbi"" just a few doors down. I definitely recommend this place! "
16821,93108533,11/8/16,2135775,Madeline,Great place in a perfect location! Thanks! 
16821,94903834,17/8/16,46046962,Carly,"Nice big room in a great apartment! Having the fire escape off of the room and the balcony at the back was great, and I really enjoyed sunbathing on the roof! The space is relaxed, warm and homely - just what I hoped for, and the East Village location gives you a nice escape if you're doing touristy stuff in the day. Casey himself was a fantastic host...he went out of his way to make me feel welcome and even helped me out when I had a bit of personal drama. Being in NY on my own, hanging out with Casey and his friends was a great bonus :-)
Thank you!"
16821,97092709,25/8/16,1711113,Mark,Perfect for what I needed. Great location. 
16821,97756981,28/8/16,5338683,Cristine,"Casey was out of town when I visited but made sure to contact me the day of my booking to facilitate the key pickup. I'd say the whole experience was just what
I was looking for. I was traveling alone and wanted to stay in an interesting place in a great neighborhood.
The Lower East Side is a funky little area and the apartment matched its flavor. There was a great fire escape off of my bedroom and a really awesome deck looking out onto private courtyards. Pressed tin ceilings and a hodgepodge of furniture and art really added to the charm. There's no A/C but Casey's fan setup worked well for me! 
I'd say this place is worth a stay if you're looking for an ""authentic"" East Village vibe. "
16821,99334572,4/9/16,26773369,Sanjukta,"Casey was very helpful and welcoming during my stay, and the logistical aspects of it were great. The listing is almost exactly as described, and the room was as comfortable and cosy as expected. The apartment is bohemian, relaxed and homely, and it gives you a great insight into not only New York life, but the East Village too, which was wonderful. I would stay here for a vacation, but it isn't great for a work trip. For one thing, the bathroom is nowhere near as clean and tidy as expected or represented - the bathtub was dirty and smelled. I was shocked by this, considering the rest of the apartment was so liveable and welcoming. The second downside is that the nearest subway is a 15 minute walk away, and not convenient for getting to and from the apartment easily, so I had to take taxis and walk a lot. However, my stay was quiet and peaceful, and Casey was very friendly. "
16821,99908082,6/9/16,272852,Dan,"Casey did a great job of coordinating my stay (and the handover of keys) even though he was out of town. Especially considering the last-minute booking, it all went very smoothly."
16821,104440176,26/9/16,61566367,Meg,"Our stay at Casey's was delightful, to say the least. With his apartment in the heart of the East Village, we felt immersed in the culture of the neighborhood and welcomed in the apartment. The place is just a short walk to Greenwich, and a quick subway ride to anywhere in the city you can imagine. Casey is warm, casual, and a sweet host. Thanks again! "
16821,108810258,17/10/16,511759,Maíra,"Everything was great! Casey went out of his way to make sure I could check in really early in the morning. The apartment is beautiful, super quiet. I didn't get a chance to meet him or his roommates, but after my first day I was already feeling like home. Neighborhood is also nice, close to everything walking distance like subway, public bikes and so on. "
16821,109886698,23/10/16,71293702,Gustavo,"El lugar es muy buena opción, con muchos cafes y resto. El barrio es Bohemio y divertido para salir de noche.
El departamento es amplio y confortable.
Casey estuvo siempre muy predispuesto para responder mis preguntas e inquietudes
Solo mejoraría un poco la limpieza del baño y de la habitación, para mi gusto podría haber estado mejor."
16821,112315049,5/11/16,6894446,Emily,Casey was very accommodating. He allowed me to arrive early so I could work on some hw in the living room. The bed was very comfortable and the apartment is spacious for the location and stylish. It was a great stay! 
16821,112563303,6/11/16,15919859,Deepak,"Casey proactively reached out and planned the key pick up. I didn't get a chance to meet him in person. House was exactly as shown in the pictures. I loved the location, close to all the neighborhood bars and his recommendations were good. Right next lane we have a top 10 Ramen place and def. worth a visit. I would definitely stay at this place next time when I visit NY. Thank you, Casey! :)"
16821,116006712,27/11/16,24936853,Michael,Good location in downtown Manhattan. Casey helped us find his place and arrange the things while he was out of town. Great guy! This place is close to China town and has lots of bars around. Great value for money. Good for solo traveler but not for family. 
16821,116663385,2/12/16,324379,Marly,"Casey's a really kind, communicative host. Very easy to get in touch with and responsive. The apartment space is big, but the bedroom is cluttered. Other than a smoky odor in the bedroom, the room was fine and the bed was comfortable. Cool bohemian space, great location, friendly host. "

16821,180933927,11/8/17,65071312,Kyra,"I stayed in Casey's place for nearly a month while I was working in the city and was so happy I chose this spot. Casey was out of town for the majority of my stay and when I checked in/out, but is an awesome communicator and readily available to help with any questions. I strongly recommend Casey's apartment - well-decorated, private, perfect location (so central and in one of the best neighborhoods in NYC) and overall an amazing experience."
16821,194312159,16/9/17,943666,Monica,"The flat is in an amazing location. Check in was made very easy by Casey even though he wasn't there. However the cleanliness of the bedsheet and bathroom was not very good and in the last two days of my stay the bath was ripped to be replaced as it was in very poor conditions with black mould.. Although this is good news for the future airbnb guests, I wasn't aware of this and it did affect my stay without free access to the shower. Casey was very communicative and ready to help, but it is a pity he did not advise of this or perhaps push his landlord for information on the work."
16821,202270291,10/10/17,151585434,Morgan,"This was the perfect place to stay! I was only there for two nights and merely needed a place to sleep, but I was very comfortable staying here. 5 stars for all. Respectful and flexible host. Would stay here again if possible!! Beautiful spot and the place was very clean."
16821,205714044,22/10/17,38514264,Tim,"Stayed at Casey's place for a couple of nights. Casey wasn't around but his roommate was in from time to time, but we never formally crossed paths. Very cozy place to put your head down (on an ultra comfy bed). His place is walkable to lots of the nightlife around the LES. I'd stay at his place again."

16821,217916805,10/12/17,11328321,Laura,"Good location with tons of restaurants and shops around; good location for the metro too.
Check in was easy and I always had great communication with Casey. I only saw one of the (Hidden by Airbnb) during my stay, everyone is very respectful and we did not bother one another.
The room is very warm and the bed really comfy, you'll get noise from the street so I recommend bringing ear plugs if you're a light sleeper (I brought mine and slept like a log); the towel I was given could have been cleaner, that's my only complaint."
16821,225780354,7/1/18,158693937,해성,"Nice and large, clean room. Amazing pictures are all around the house and you can see how kind he are. If you choose this place, that gonna be best choice in your travel. You can enjoy every single part of this place."

16821,264279407,13/5/18,6604177,Claire,"J’ai beaucoup aimé rester room #1 chez Casey. Je ne l’ai pas rencontré en personne mais j’ai croisé ses colocataires. L’ambiance de l’appartement/loft est très typique new-yorkais. Le quartier est assez idéal selon mes critères. La rue est calme. La bonne nouvelle en arrivant, c’est que le deuxième étage sans ascenseur correspond à un seul niveau en Europe. Donc si vous avez une lourde valise il n’y aura qu’une envolée de marches à monter ! C’est un hébergement que je recommande."
16821,271499107,1/6/18,8978815,Brenna,"Casey's place is a great one -- comfortable, quiet, and with nice atmospheric touches. Not to mention super walkable to tons of food and bars and pretty easy to get around to other spots in the city.

16974,27210,21/2/10,81462,Kelvin,"Six colleagues and I stayed at Robin’s loft for a weekend and we had a marvelous stay!  The loft was very roomy, cozy, and quiet.  The surrounding area was very safe. There was parking directly in front of the apartment, and it was only two blocks away from the subway which made traveling convenient.  In addition, Robin and her family were GREAT hosts and the price was unbeatable!!! I would definitely recommend staying at her loft!    "
16974,32410,30/3/10,92050,Katherine,"Robin was a wonderful hostess, and her loft is amazing: beautiful, spacious, well-maintained and equipped.  Some mornings my family lingered longer than we needed to before heading out for the day, just because we felt so comfortable.  Robin also helped us out when we hit a snafu on the last day of our stay and almost missed our flight.  I would stay with Robin again without hesitation."
16974,48294,31/5/10,119860,Remy,"I spent 3 weeks in this amazing loft! It's very spacious, beautiful, clean and very quiet! And everything you need is close by: quintessentiel Harlem, shops, restaurants, the subway. And Robin is very charming and a great host. I highly recommend it highly."
16974,93333,8/9/10,169429,Shannon,"What a trip!  Robin is the most gracious hostess In NYC.  Her SpaHa Loft was incredible, Spacious and the pictures do not do it justice.  Everything you need she has provided....Fresh Linens, Towels, Iron & Ironing board, washer and Dryer, a handy Instruction guide to access the Internet, Bus routes, Subway, you name it she provides. 

This was my first Airbnb experience and I must admit I was a bit skeptical, especially when my first host cancelled My reservation due to plumbing (Website hidden by Airbnb) the last minute........That is where Robin took the reins and was an angel to host myself and my daughter, The SpaHa loft is such a cozy space where you can relax after exploring the city.

Words cannot express how much fun we had!

Thank you Robin,

Shannon and Grace

We will definitely use the loft again on our next trip to NYC!

16974,103757,24/9/10,128632,Wayne,"I'm a fairly regular visitor to New York, but this is the first time i've never stayed in a hotel. Six friends and I stayed in Robin's apartment and I have to say it was a fantastic experience. The loft is a huge home away from home with everything you could ask for. Robin was the perfect host, very friendly and helpful. If you want to experience the real New York, this is an ideal place to stay. Highly recommended."
16974,110755,3/10/10,233781,Marysia,"Robin's loft was gorgeous!! The space is amazing, modern, beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The location is also great, in Manhattan, 5 minute walk to the metro, close restaurants nearby. We loved the restaurant Amore Cubano. If you stay here on a Sunday, check out the Baptist church and their amazing gospel choir. Robin was also a wonderful host. She left us a lot of information about local attractions in her neighborhood. She was very friendly and even helped us find a salsa dancing place. Thank you Robin, we definitely recommend staying in the SpaHa Loft!"

16974,155243,18/12/10,199172,Johanna,"Thank you so much Robin.....We had a fantastic time in New York! We arrived late, Robin had organised agreat taxi service ride for us and they even turned up after our flight was 3 hours late-what a relief, we were so pleased to have that ride sorted at 10pm!!! Robin kindly bought food in for us also.  We spent most days out from 9am till 8pm got back and forward on the subway very easily. The apartment was huge and we had to walk down to talk to the kids in the bedrooms cause they couldn't even hear us yelling at them from the kitchen!!! The apartment has a fully equipped laundry such a bonus for travelers like us. Totally recommend staying with Robin! 
"
16974,208470,25/3/11,278623,Stu,"The loft was a great base for three execs doing meetings and business in NYC.  Just a short walk to the subway, all our meetings downtown and in Brooklyn were just 1 or 2 trains away.  Locally the area is full of life and has yet to be gentrified so you get a true feel of real life New York.  Robin was a wonderful host, greeting us as we arrived to run through the layout of the loft and brief us on local shopping, restaurants and answer any questions.  The loft is HUGE and provided more than enough space for the three of us, who has been travelling together already for a couple of weeks, so it was perfect layout that afforded the opportunity to get away from each other for privacy when we needed or to sit together and discuss business on the comfortable couches or at the large dining table.  The SpaHa loft was exactly what we were looking for and saved us a fortune on hotels downtown.  See you again next year Robin!"
16974,226600,14/4/11,482951,Kelli,"Robin was a wonderful host. We enjoyed ourselves immensely and would definitely stay there again. Spaha is beautiful and  in a location that is accessible to train and multiple types of food. Thanks you made our trip, which was really busy quiet and peaceful. "

Would recommend this loft to others very highly."

L'appartement est vraiment très spacieux et convient parfaitement à une famille de huit personnes, Les chambres sont calme. Cette situation est appréciable aprés des journées bien remplies. 

Nous voyagions avec un bébé et Robin nous a fourni un lit adapté. Tout a été effectué pour rendre notre séjour agréable.

L'appartement est entièrement climatisé. Les stations de métro sont proches de l'appartement et un supermarché est à deux pas. 

Notre séjour a été parfait. Encore Merci à Robin.

Robin and her famille were really very nice to me and my family. This place is nicely located, clean, safe, and just a couple of metro stations for downtown. I recommend Robin's place with no restrictions."

My family is very satisfied with your accommodation. Your place is spacious, private, clean, quiet, and most of all your service was extraordinary. 
Your accommodation and service had not only met our expectation but exceeded our satisfaction. I would recommend your place to anyone.
This is to all (Website hidden by Airbnb) not let ‘Harlem’ reputation or whatever you’ve heard about the area and environment hesitate you from consider of renting this wonderful SpaHa Loft. The area is safe!

Thank you so much,

16974,661894,25/10/11,723611,Sunny,"Staying at Robin's loft really made the trip easy. It's in a great location if you want to be away from the craziest parts of the city, but still have easy access to everything.  We were a group of 7 friends/couples, and we all really enjoyed it. Robin was great...friendly, but also left us alone to do our own thing. The loft is very open (as described), so just be aware that sound really carries throughout. It might not be ideal for a mixed group of early birds and night owls."
16974,793558,19/12/11,1442615,Ellen,"Our small film cast and crew (about 7 people) stayed here for over a week in December of 2011.  It was a perfect location for us to spread out and feel at home.  Transportation to other parts of Manhattan was very easy via subway and cab or car service.  Robin had a binder full of great recommendations for food and things to do in the neighborhood and we took advantage of the kitchen and the takeout options in the area.    Two of us were older people in their 80s and this was a great building for them to stay in because the elevator made it accessible. Spacious, comfortable, relaxing, lots of sunlight in the afternoon, many different beds and fold-out couch sleeping options.  Only tough part for a group this big was that the walls aren't floor to ceiling in all the rooms so you have to work out some quiet hours.  Overall, a great place to stay and we would do it again."
16974,1070716,2/4/12,1352581,Cristina,"My family and I stay there for a bit mrore than a week and it was perfect. Clean, pretty and spacious. There're two subway stops closeby. It is not the nicest area in Manhattan but we didn't have any problem. The only thing to be careful with is that walls don't get till the ceiling and you can hear everything. However, it wasn't a problem for us. Robin and George were really helpful and nice. I would defenitly recommend Spaha Loft!"
16974,1109977,12/4/12,419479,Louise,"We had a week in New York at Robin's SpaHa loft - 4 middle aged Aussie women in East Harlem - no problem.! We were close to and thus used the subway and bus system. Robin was a terrific host and explained how everything worked, gave us detailed information on everything we needed and even directed us to the local Baptist gospel church for Easter. We felt safe the whole time- and we did come home at night after 10:00pm on occasions.
The loft is wonderful, comfy beds, lots of room, well appointed, excellent laundry and kitchen. Clean and quiet. All our expectations were met and exceeded!
Robyn was great - before we arrived she had emailed me and then arranged a driver to pick us up at the Airport - all of which was really helpful. 
I can't think of a single negative thing and if I were to go back I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.
It was a great experience staying there, we had a wonderful host and a wonderful time in the big apple!"
16974,1246113,8/5/12,1829223,Alexandra,"We had a very nice stay in Robin's great loft. It is really huge and well equipped and very comfortable. We found a parking space directly in front of the door and there were several others down the road. A supermarket is directly around the next corner where we could buy everything we needed. The next Metro-Station is only a five-minutes-walk away.
At night the neighbourhood is really quiet, the only disturbance was the snoring of my fellow-travellers :-)
We surely would like to stay in Robin's loft again!"
16974,1409237,4/6/12,1762474,Pil,Robin's loft is the perfect place to spend your holidays in New York with your family. Robin is very nice and helpful. The apartment is as nice as it is shown in the pictures. Great experience!
16974,1453403,11/6/12,763713,Sara,"Great location, tons of space! This apartment is very large with room for everyone. It is very conveniently located 5 short blocks from the 4 and 5 subway lines and 4 short blocks from the 6 line. You are located right next to a park, no grass but more a paved area with benches and lots of trees. Robin had a binder with many things to do in the area. I would highly recommend the BBQ place that is in the binder, it was delicious! Full kitchen made it very easy to bring home leftovers and cook a few meals at home. I would definitely stay again. Thanks.
This is a loft style apartment. The three bedrooms in the back are separated by walls but you can hear just about everything. Luckily, the extra room up front is perfect if you have a snorer:)"

16974,2797207,4/11/12,1474007,Richard,"We had a great time at the loft in Spanish Harlem, despite being there for Hurricane Sandy!  Four of us were very comfortable in the four bedrooms and had plenty of space to ourselves.

We had to stay indoors for a couple of evenings during the worst of the weather but that was no hardship as we'd stocked up on goodies from the supermarket that is literally 30 seconds away.

Robin was a great host - checking back every now and then that we hadn't blown away - and providing a folder with loads of good stuff to do.  

The location is great, about a $20 cab ride from Times Square, or a 5/10 minute walk to the subway or bus stop.  You're also only 10 blocks away from Central Park.  On one of the days we walked from the apartment in to Manhattan (as the subways/buses weren't running) which was a fairly long walk but lots of good sights to see on the way.

We went to Ellen's Stardust Diner on 51st and Broadway quite a few times and had great fun with the singing waitstaff, the food was great too.

Would happily come back to this apartment next time I'm in New York and I couldn't recommend it highly enough!"
16974,2899640,17/11/12,1004803,Mandy,"Myself and my 3 friends had a wonderful stay at Robin's loft, I can only echo what the other reviews say - it is a very large apartment with loads of space and Robin is a lovely lady. It felt very comfortable and homely with a great kitchen and two bathrooms which was convenient. As the walls don't reach the ceiling it may not be the best place for a group with different timings to stay as the sound travels, but it was not a problem for us - it was just great to all have our own space and privacy which we would not have got in a hotel for the same price, by a mile!! Also it was great to be able to sit round a table together and chat, or watch TV together on the sofas.
The neighbourhood felt safe and there are loads of shops nearby - a little hint, if you want to get to Grand Central quickly, walk to the 125th subway stop and take the express train. This is quicker than going from 116th because that stops at every station.
I would certainly stay here again and would definately recommend Robin's loft, even to large groups and families."
16974,3132471,22/12/12,1828729,Berna,"I cannot recommend the Spaha Loft and hosts Robin and George more highly. The apartment is fabulous - tons of space, great location near subway, supermarket, restaurants and shops, and in a quiet street. Robin and George are kind, generous and very knowledgeable. The perfect base for a New York City vacation."
16974,3162082,27/12/12,3628990,Ivan,"Our stay in NYC for Christmas was absolutely magical. Without this beautiful loft would not be the same, we felt like at home and on Christmas Day we were able to preparing the table with a delicious thanksgivingday turkey.
The house despite the generous size was very clean and the beds very comfortable.
The water in the bathroom comes out really hot and plentiful.
The shower was a moment of real pleasure.
Express line 4 is reached in a few minutes the most famous spots in Manhattan.
Robin was really a very nice host and delighted us on Christmas day with a delicious cinnamon pumpkin pie.
The neighborhood was very quiet. Don't listen to all the crap peoples say about Harlem!!!. It's a very lively and colorful neighborhood.
I would recommend Robin to anyone for your stay!!

Le quartier est tranquille. Un supermarché juste en bas de la maison et beaucoup de magasin pour faire du shopping à bon marcher. Le métro est situé à 10mn de marche de la maison. Il y a une grande église de gospel à 2 ou 3 bloc de la maison en allant sur Lexington avenue. Robin est une très bonne hôte et disponible pour ces clients. Je conseille à beaucoup le Spaha Loft.

Robin is a very (very!) nice person which took care about us and our wiches. It`s easy to go to Manhattan downtown by the green line.
So I recommend Robins loft deeply as a accommodation!"

The apartment is just as nice as in the pictures. And big! DO NOT LISTEN to any form of crap regarding the neighbourhood. Harlem is vibrant, coloufrul, and there are tons of nice restaurants and nice places nearby, a lot cheaper then fancy places downtown, but just as good!
We were delighted in every way possible. This fab couple even arranged transportation to and from the airoprt. (that we recommend!)

Robin left a ton of super helpful information about where to go locally and the best ways to get around the city. She also set up a ride for all of us from the airport to the apartment!

We felt completely safe in the neighbourhood. Our only precaution was that we didn't walk out at night alone. 

The subway was relatively close and it took about 30 minutes to get to midtown. The travel time was the only downside... you'll definitely want to make sure you're prepared for the entire day before venturing out to avoid having to travel back and forth from the apartment.

I would definitely recommend Robin's apartment to anyone traveling with a big group or a family, looking to stay in NYC on a budget!"

16974,13904989,8/6/14,7390643,Debbie,"Myself and three friends stayed at SpaHa Loft for 6 nights as we were celebrating our 60th birthday. It was large for only 4 people (2 ended up not coming), but we loved having the space, especially the 2 bathrooms. It is in a working class neighborhood which makes it more interesting than staying downtown. Subway is very close and easy to use. We would definitely recommend walking in groups of 2 or more from the subway at night as the area becomes very lively. Another alternative is to walk down 3rd avenue from the 125 subway station as it was brighter and less sketchy. Having said that, we always felt safe and enjoyed the local restaurants. We were met by George (as Robin had to leave town) and he gave us lots of good information and was willing to help us if needed. The loft was very clean and the beds comfortable. There is a lot of street noise and we had the windows open so it was a bit noisy but nothing we couldn't handle. Kitchen is well equipped and there is shopping just around the corner. It was a wonderful place to stay and we would recommend it to anyone considering it. We bought the $30 7 day ride as much as you want Metro card and it was well worth the money. We also had the hop-on hop-off 2 day bus pass which is such a good thing to do. We took the downtown, uptown and night tour. We were thankful to have such a nice place to stay while in New York. Thank  you Robin and George!"

Robin’s loft afforded us the opportunity to interact with New Yorkers at a much better level than a doorman at a swanky hotel. The neighborhood is rich with experiences and loft is located within easy walking distance to the subway. Our family of five adults, originally 7, appreciated the cleanliness, layout, two bathrooms, expansive windows, and graciousness of Robin. She was so friendly and the notebook of ideas left for our pursuing told us everything we needed to know. We stayed for over a week and it was our best family vacation thus far out of the past seven years. Treat yourself and book today.”

The apartment was as describe on the pictures, a lot of space, very beautifull and very practical. The only little thing is that the walls of the rooms do not go up to the ceiling so there s not a lot of privacy.  
But we enjoyed very much our stay. The aprtment is very near the metro and a lot of commerces. Thanks again to Robin and her husband."
16974,22517743,9/11/14,15582425,Matt,"Positives- The loft is very spacious and can accommodate large groups.  It was nicely furnished and about a 5 min walk from the subway station.  It's also relatively cheap compared to something closer to downtown.  

Negatives - It is about a 30 min subway ride to get downtown.  

Other useful information - It's about a $20-30 cab ride to downtown with no traffic.  If you're heading back late with a group, I would highly recommend taking a taxi over riding the subway.

Eravamo in otto, ma non abbiamo avuto alcun problema anche grazie al fatto che c'erano due bagni e due docce! Robin e suo marito non ci hanno fatto mancare nulla e sono sempre stati disponibili a darci una mano. Tutto ha funzionato alla perfezione e siamo veramente grati ai nostri ospiti per averci dato la possibilità di trascorrere la nostra vacanza in piena tranquillità. Da non trascurare che Robin parla bene l'italiano, il francese e lo spagnolo oltre che l'inglese e questo ha facilitato la comunicazione. Il quartiere è tranquillo e non ci ha dato problemi, la metro era a sole 4 strade di distanza e spesso siamo andati persino a piedi dall'appartamento fino al central park in poco tempo. Grazie di tutto!"
16974,23746486,9/12/14,18445396,Bruno,"Proprietaria gentilissima e disponibile per tutte le informazioni utili, parla italiano. L'appartamento è spazioso e l'abbiamo trovato molto pulito. Colazioni e cene in casa, vicino c e' un supermercato fornitissimo. La posizione e' tranquilla e silenziosa, vicino a un piccolo parco e a poca distanza dalle fermate della metro e dei bus. Da consigliare."
16974,24130920,21/12/14,17317956,Hugh,"Robin was awesome!

16974,24714196,2/1/15,22353184,Manuel,"Robin a été très présente tout le long de la réservation et a répondu rapidement à toutes nos demandes.  Les commentaires sur son logement et le quartier se sont avérés tout à fait corrects.   Le loft est bien placé à Harlem, à deux pas du métro. Bien qu'il ne soit pas au centre, il ne faut qu'une vingtaine de minutes pour atteindre Times Square.  Central Parc est aussi tout proche.  Un supermarché hyper pratique et très bien fourni se trouve à 50 mètres du logement.  Le loft offre tout le confort nécessaire pour deux familles.   Vraiment une très bonne alternative pour loger à New York à prix raisonnable."

Les murs ne montent effectivement pas jusqu'au plafond mais pour notre famille de 4, ce n'était pas un problème puisque nous avions tous les mêmes horaires.
L'appartement est très bien situé (sur la ligne 6 du métro).
Robin a été parfaite."
16974,27827024,13/3/15,4664759,Christel,"Our stay in the SpaHa loft was wonderful!      Being a party of eight, the spacious four bedrooms and living area worked out great.  The apartment was stocked well with kitchen goods, full-size w/d, and plenty of towels.  The beds were very comfortable and the apartment is quiet during the night.....which is VERY IMPORTANT in Manhattan....also only a few blocks to the subway and the Metro-North train.
Robin was so very helpful and generous!  We had a series of unforeseen occurrences due to weather and flight cancellations, and she went out of her way to accommodate our stay.  I visit New York every winter and plan on staying here again."
16974,30062529,17/4/15,21529668,Estelle,"Nous rentrons juste d'une semaine fantastique à New York où nous étions logés (à sept) dans le superbe loft de Robin situé dans East Harlem. Le logement est tout à fait conforme à l'annonce. Spacieux, pour ne pas dire immense, situé au 1er étage à proximité d'un petit square (fermé la nuit) peu fréquenté si ce n'est par des écureuils, d'une école dans un quartier calme. Tout l'électroménager à disposition, une très bonne literie, un grand salon avec des canapés ""vintage"" pour accueillir tous les occupants, une grande et pratique cuisine, deux salles de bain bien utiles pour la capacité de ce loft et de grandes chambres, dont en effet les murs ne montent pas au plafond mais c'est ce qui en fait tout son charme. L'appartement est sécurisé et situé à proximité de deux stations de métro (116th street et 125th street) et d'un certain nombre de commerces .Bien qu'étant sur Harlem, nous n'avons pas senti d'insécurité même en rentrant tard dans la nuit. 
En ce qui concerne l'accueil, Robin était présente pour nous accueillir et nous présenter en Français s'il vous plait, l'appartement, nous conseiller sur les sites touristiques à voir, ... Pour notre départ,  elle a fait patienter le chauffeur de notre navette pour l'aéroport puisque nous avions quelques minutes de retard. Elle a été parfaite.
Une adresse que nous recommandons chaudement et vivement.grand merci à Robin et son Mari "

Robin est très sympathique, disponible et de bons conseils.
La situation géographique par rapport au métro est pratique : en 20 minutes à peine, par un train express, on est au cœur de Manhattan. 
Le quartier est calme en journée, un peu plus agité la nuit, notamment à la sortie du métro.
La proximité d'un supermarché est très appréciable.
Nous y avons passé un très bon séjour."

Le quartier est très bien, le métro est a 5 bonnes minutes a pied et un magasin pour les ""ravitaillements"" est juste a coté de l'appartement.
A réserver sans hésiter et merci à Robin pour son accueil et sa disponibilité quand nous avions besoin d'un renseignement et en français si besoin est.

16974,34138373,5/6/15,31591520,Joel,"We were delighted with this apartment and the warm welcome from our host. It's true, the place is huge, and provided an ideal space for my two colleagues and I to live and work. It is in a vibrant part of Manhattan with easy access to the centre and airports. Our host made sure we had everything we needed, and even offered to look after my suitcase after I'd checked out. One person described it as ""better than the Waldorf - Astoria"" - what more can I say?! Highly recommended."
16974,35057619,15/6/15,22690209,Bernard," Nous avons particulièrement apprécié l'accueil de Robin qui a patienté malgré notre arrivée tardive. L'appartement est très calme, vaste,lumineux avec de beaux volumes et bien aménagé.Le métro est à proximité et permet de rejoindre facilement le centre de NYC en 20mn. Boutiques de quartier et petits commerces pratiques aux horaires étendus complètent le tableau de ce quartier populaire et animé, de jour comme de nuit.

Pictures describes very well the apt. Highly recommend.
In no time you will be down town by the express metro.
A super choice to go with this rental !!

16974,37543616,8/7/15,22918831,Edith,"Un quartier où l'on se sent en sécurité avec une grande surface proche pour faire ses courses, c'est bien pratique et une station de métro sur la 116ème street, ligne n° 6."
16974,37949831,12/7/15,1442328,Rachel,"I stayed at the SpaHa Loft with 6 of my friends for a Central Park wedding. I don't think we could have chosen a better apartment. The loft was extremely spacious (especially for NYC standards)! It looks just like the pictures/description. We enjoyed the large dining table and sitting area. The separate rooms and 2 baths were amazing-although not at all private. Privacy was not an issue at all for us so it was no big deal. 

Robin & George were wonderful hosts who made our stay very comfortable. They even let one couple drop their bags off early since they got into town sooner than anticipated. There was a large map of the area with subway lines there to guide us which was very helpful. The loft is stocked with everything you could want-there was even a washer and dryer.

I will say that the loft is a bit out of the main city. It is close to subway lines which was nice and we would take the subway into town-about 30min to most places we wanted to go. The neighborhood has quite a bit of character. We felt safe walking around in the day time especially in a group, but I would avoid walking late at night. We took the subway late at night one time and while we were fine, it was a bit uncomfortable. I gave this loft 4/5 stars due to the location issues. But again, it was well worth it because of the quality of the loft.

Overall, I highly recommend this loft. I don't think you will find this high quality and spacious of an apartment for the price in NYC. We really enjoyed our stay in NYC and this loft was a great home base."
16974,38651558,17/7/15,37709608,Jason,"Not as advertised!  The loft, while enormous, is very, very average in terms of comforts and amenities.  TV doesn't work (rabbit ears???).  Wifi not accessible from one side of the loft.  Towels were mouldy and smelled stale.  None of the bedrooms have doors.  Front door was dirty, as were some of the walls which made us question the cleanliness of the entire place.  The owners (who live on the third floor) have dogs, which bark and can be heard walking on the floor, are noisy.

The location in Spanish Harlem was great, but I've had many, many better experiences in NYC.  

Bottom line...try another listing."
16974,39472993,24/7/15,21876858,Nadia,"Robin und George sind extrem sympathisch. Sie haben uns herzlich begrüsst und waren bei Problemen immer erreichbar und hilfsbereit.
Die Loft sah genau so aus wie auf den Bildern und war grösstenteils sehr sauber und die Einrichtung vollständig und in sehr gutem Zustand. 
Die Wohnung ist sehr geräumig und eignet sich auch gut für eine Familie. Da die Zimmerwände nicht bis zur Decke reichen, ist alles ein wenig ringhörig. Die Umgebung ist schön und man ist schnell bei der Subway und dem Bus um ins Stadtzentrum zu gelangen.

16974,48982731,30/9/15,30350686,Helen,We have had an fantastic stay in NY and this apartment!  The apartment was as big as the pictures (Website hidden by Airbnb) was even better☺ We were 5 adults and we have plenty of space. The beds were very comfortable and everything you may  need  in a kitchen was there.  The Subway was 7-10 min away and it was no problem at all to take the train wherever you want to go. Robin the host was very helpful.
16974,50062135,9/10/15,28843480,Patricia,"My friends and I stayed at SpaHa Loft for 8 nights in early October and had a wonderful time. The apartment was spacious, comfortable and quiet. It's location was close to the subway and in particular Robin and her husband were extremely helpful and gracious hosts. The only thing the place did not have was a big enough TV for the spacious living room and access to more channels would have been nice after a long day sightseeing. On the whole I would recommend the apartment when visiting NY.
Trish"
16974,50912885,16/10/15,27007603,Jack,"George met us when we arrived and was very helpful with info about New York and his neighborhood, Robin was out of town, but stopped by the next day to say hi, they were both very polite and fun people.
We had 5 in our group and we loved the loft, very spacious and clean, we used all the amenities, such as the coffee maker, refrigerator, iron and ironing board, the women loved having a blow dryer, lots of extra towels and linen, the washer and dryer were great, next time we come we will pack less clothes since we can wash them there.
Nice little store on the corner with everything that we needed, Patsy's pizza was just a few blocks away.
Robin arranged for transportation to and from the airport, which I highly recommend, it was a father and son team, and they were very punctual and polite, and got us to and from the airport without any problem.
Some have said that the neighbor hood at night was iffy, but I guess it depends on where you grew up, we never had any problems, in fact my wife and brother-in-law walked about 4 blocks to ""Little Mexico"" to get dinner one night with no issue, and we were walking to Patsy's pizza almost every night, which is about 4 blocks away, I always felt safe, and people overall in New York were very polite, I think we only ran into 2 people that were having a bad day and that was on the subway, we stayed from Saturday to the following Friday.
I highly recommend Robin/George and their loft for your stay in New York.
We also loved that this loft was smoke free.

Thank you Robin and George for a wonderful time/experience in New York and your beautiful loft, ""WE WILL BE BACK!"""

Nous nous sommes immédiatement sentis à l'aise dans ce magnifique loft qui offre énormément de place et de commodités. La tranquillité et la facilité d'accès  au loft (conseillé via Third Avenue, et non pas Lexington Av., pour plus de sécurité) sont des points positifs. Son emplacement le long de la ligne de métro no 6 est idéale. Rejoindre le Sud de Manhattan est une affaire de moins de 30 min, sans changement ! Un supermarché se trouve à quelques pas du loft... très pratique.

D'abord il est vraiment très grand et convivial avec une vraie grande table. Les chambres sont grandes, il y a beaucoup de rangements et tout l'équipement nécessaire. Pour notre groupe de 8 adultes en 2 familles c'était idéal. Le fait que les cloisons ne sont pas entièrement fermées ne nous a pas du tout gêné. Ensuite, il est très calme, ce qui est rare à Manhattan, tout en étant vraiment proche du centre, le métro étant à deux pas. Comme cela a été dit, il y a un supermarché très pratique juste au coin de la rue ouvert 24h/24 avec tout ce qu'il faut. Enfin nos hotes Robin et George sont vraiment charmants, Robin parle français, elle s'est occupée de notre transfert depuis JFK, et nous a attendue avec le sourire malgré nos 3 heures de retard d'avion jusqu'à plus de 23h alors qu'elle et son mari partaient en voyage le lendemain matin. Le jour de notre départ, nous avons pu aussi laisser nos 8 valises jusque dans l'après midi car notre vol était en soirée. En résumé, notre séjour a été parfait, et si nous revenons à New York, c'est sûr que nous y retournerons."

On arrival we were greeted and given a tour of the premises by George.  We received a warm welcome and some great advice (seeing as we arrived during Weather Storm Jonas).

Robin also provides a great welcome pack manual of places to eat/shop which became really useful on days we did not want to venture out of Harlem.

The apartment itself was a lot bigger then expected :)

Vielen lieben Dank an Robin, die schon während unseren Reisevorbereitungen im Vorfeld bei Fragen immer umgehend mit hilfreichen Antworten und Tipps weitergeholfen hat. Absolut zu Empfehlen. Ich war anfangs skeptisch in Harlem zu wohnen, ich kann aber nur bestätigen, es ist eine absolut ruhige und angenehme Gegend.

This place is huge for a NYC home! Layout worked well though if u have snorers in your group like we did, bring some earplugs. With such a big space the sound travels. Location was great for most of us. I like not being in the middle of the tourist craziness and it was a quick subway ride to Times Square. But we had 2 elderly folks with us who wanted to see the sights which meant subways were out so we made good use of Uber to get back and forth. The grocery store at the corner is amazing! Seriously, u don't need to shop before u get here. It has everything! I would highly recommend Robin and her home and will be back myself in the future :-)"

16974,105009271,29/9/16,18963743,Euan,"Robins apartment is great and Robin is an amazing host.

The apt is situated on a great quiet road away from the hustle and bustle of the city and is very clean and tidy. We had four people there but it could comfortably sleep 8 (2 doubles, 2 twins). We had the whole place to ourselves and it was a great base for exploring Harlem but also had easy access to the subway which takes you to midtown and downtown really easily. Great location, easy to get to late at night by subway or taxi.

We ate out a lot but the apt is a great place to relax of you have a quite evening in and it has all the facilities for self catering (plus washing machine!) if you decide to do that. Great supermarket just round the corner too.

Robin was so helpful in the months before our trip - the family brought my mum to New York for her 70th birthday - helping answer all the questions we had in super quick time and recommending things to do. She also have us lots of useful info when we arrived and even found bars me and my brother could watch British soccer at at 7 am!

I hope to get another group together in future to visit NYC and stay at Robin's place again. Thanks! Euan"

16974,127588413,19/1/17,109430969,Craig,"SpaHa loft was exactly as described.   The space was enormous and was perfect for our family of 5.  Everyone had their own space.   The second full bathroom was great as it allowed us to have a separate bathroom for the kids which made everyone happier.

Market around corner had everything you needed.   Subway was only 5 minutes walk so we used it all the time to get around.   Took a number of Robin's suggestions for restaurants and they were all great. 

Robin was a great host and always responded immediately to any queries and was willing to help out anytime. 

I would recommend the loft to any large family or group traveling to New York.

Felt safe in the apartment and public transport was within a 5 minute walk for buses into the city and the subway was a few minutes longer. I hadn't realised that the apartment was in such close proximity to Central Park which you could walk to an about 20 minutes -and a fantastic open space to explore. Would highly recommend Robin's SpaHa Loft. Thank you Robin."

Our host, Robin, was so attentive to our needs and greeted us on arrival, made sure we had all we needed and gave us advice when we had questions on New York generally. The apartment is in Harlem but within walking distance of subways, a supermarket around the corner and a very convenient place to stay. The apartment was huge with great amenities, kitchen appliances and utensils, crockery, etc, cupboard spaces, laundry in the unit, ironing room set up. We had a group of five ladies staying and it was perfect for our needs. Definitely recommend this great apartment. Thanks Robin for being such a great host.

16974,160267845,13/6/17,10204041,Lukas,"Wir hatten eine großartige Zeit in Robins Apartment. Die Räumlichkeiten sind wirklich riesig und noch weitläufiger als man nach den Fotos vermuten würde. Robin und ihre Familie waren äußerst freundliche, zuvorkommende und stets hilfsbereite Gastgeber. Der Weg zu den touristischen Spots war aufgrund der strategisch guten Lage gut mit der U-Bahn zu bewältigen. Harlem ist ein Bezirk mit gewissen sozialen Problemen, man kommt also, wenn man sich im öffentlichen Raum bewegt, unweigerlich auch mit Armut in Kontakt, alle Begegnungen, die wir hatten, waren jedoch freundlich und wir haben uns nie bedrängt gefühlt. Im Gegenteil haben wir das sehr lebhafte Spanish Harlem genossen und waren abends gerne noch zum Essen in einem der guten von Robin empfohlenen Restaurants. Wenn wieder ein New York-Urlaub ansteht, kommen wir gerne wieder!"
16974,164265165,26/6/17,34332548,Leslie,"Robin's SpaHa Loft was absolutely perfect for our large group of 9 people! The double door locked entrance made us feel safe and secure, and the elevator straight to our loft was perfect for those with luggage and after long days of walking all over NYC! The loft itself was beautiful with more than ample space! We had a total of 9 people staying in the loft that was able to accommodate us all comfortably. The loft came with everything we needed for our 4 night stay, including kitchen supplies, towels, toiletries, extra sheets and laundry units in the loft. Robin was very easy to get in touch with and even had a welcome binder with plenty of recommendation spots around the Loft. The Loft was only 3 short blocks (about a 2-3 minute walk) from the subway/metro station that we took every day to get to the different neighborhoods in NYC. We also took an Uber at times when we didn't want to take the metro and never had any issues. We can't wait to return to NYC for another vacation!"
16974,166446858,3/7/17,51260046,Marie,"This location is a great deal for North Manhattan. The apartment is huge and located next to a fantastic grocery store. The sushi there is truly some of the best that we have tasted. There is not much privacy in the apartment - no floor to ceiling walls and no doors on bedrooms. Also, not the ritzier part of the city - a little gritty at times so be prepared."

Noi eravamo in 5 ma va bene anche per un gruppo più numeroso, direi fino a 8 persone ci si sta comodi. Anche come ubicazione non è scomoda con la subway fermate (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) arriva in poche fermate alla fifth avenue. Un alloggio strepitoso e molto newyorkese."
16974,244380517,18/3/18,95954747,Denise,Robin and George are exceptional hosts! The loft was perfect for our needs -- there were 6 of us and we had space to all be together and to be alone. The second bathroom was invaluable on busy mornings. We had everything we needed -- a complete kitchen and laundry and an elevator! This place is sparkling clean and well laid out -- it's a great value and I would highly recommend it.

Las camas son muy cómodas y eso siempre se agradece. AdemásRobin fue encantadora en todo momento, desde la llegada hasta el final y nos dio todo tipo de consejos y recomendaciones. Gracias por todo! :)"
16974,252139534,9/4/18,4944319,Jack,"Robin and her husband were wonderful hosts and greeted us at the door when we arrived from LaGuardia. The apartment was fantastic and even larger than it looks in the photos. 2200 square feet! It was nicely decorated and we had everything we needed. The location is great and we mostly used Uber (because we had four people traveling together) to get to Midtown, which was about $25 each time. There is a subway stop nearby too. The bedrooms have walls but no ceilings, so if you have early risers and late sleepers staying together, it would be best to put the early risers in the front bedroom near the kitchen to provide quiet for the others in the back bedrooms. Also, the bedrooms have curtains instead of doors, so you need to be aware for the sake of privacy. This place is an incredible value and really comfortable, compared to the cramped hotel rooms in NYC. Thanks!"

ruim van opzet.
De diverse kamers staan weliswaar in open verbinding met elkaar maar door de ruime indeling is er toch voldoende privacy.
Robin is een geweldige vrouw:gastvrij, behulpzaam, attent en aanwezig wanneer het nodig is. 
De ligging geeft een eerlijk en betrouwbaar beeld van hoe de mensen in Amerika werkelijk leven.
Kortom : een aanrader met een zeer goede prijs-kwaliteit verhouding."

Its only 15-20 minutes to all the attractions of downtown NY. The area does initially look a little run down, but we had zero problems and enjoyed the local restaurants and shops. The super market around the corner is excellent, as is the local bottle shop. Robin is a delightful host. I thoroughly recommend Robins place."

Loved it!"
16990,107550,28/9/10,145518,Jim,"This is quite a clean and comfortable place, although guests not familiar with NY should know that it is a long way out, and it is a  9 or 10 block walk to the subway. The price reflects this. Make sure you have a charged cell phone with you to contact the host, or you will have trouble getting in. They don't hear knocks on the door and aren't always at home. Finally, the $200 security deposit (cash only) and the $10 service fee are real irritants. They should scrap them."

17092,27385592,3/3/15,15968194,Bill,Ralph was very hospitable and the place is just as shown. Hell's Kitchen was a cool experience. Thanks!
17092,29872493,13/4/15,20220930,Oge,"Location: It's conveniently located in on 51st in Hell's Kitchen/Midtown, so so it's close to all the action which is great. Be warned, it's 4 story walk up so you could be getting your exercise. Amish Market is nearby for groceries. 

Room: Is just as pictured, or perhaps better. Clean sheets and towels, soap, WiFi, etc. were all provided similar to a hotel.  The kitchen, dining and bathroom are pretty small (it's NYC after all!), though this shouldn't be a problem if you don't require a ton of space.

Host: Ralph was not in town when I stayed here, but he really made sure I had everything I needed to feel comfortable and took steps to remedy any issues. His partner was available in person for check in/out and responsive at all times if I had any concerns (like ""How does this shower work?"" or ""How do I get to LaGuardia?""). "
17092,30550587,24/4/15,28091998,Gabi,"Bottom line - this is indeed a cool room.

Monica was waiting for me as soon as I arrived, without too much prior coordination, and explained to me the basic stuff.
The room was clean, the bed was very big and comfortable, the working desk was great for my laptop.
I didn't notice that the room was on a 3rd floor with no elevator, so this was quite a surprise, but nevertheless not much of an issue.
The wifi connection could have been faster/better, but the other flatmate had no complains.

The area is great for both accessing all areas of Manhattan and for local nightlife (although a bit too many gay clubs...).

I didn't use the kitchen, but it's completely usable.
The bathroom door doesn't close too well.

I might book it again :)"
17092,30827259,27/4/15,29879653,Elizabeth,I really enjoyed the stay in Hell's Kitchen.  Monica greeted me when I arrived and acclimted me to the apartment!!  The decription matched the actual experience and it's a great location.  Thanks!

The apartment as whole was very clean , nice bathroom , workable kitchen and dining area. Although I didn't meet Ralph himself as he was out of town Lester in the building. The bedroom had a queen bed with plenty of closet and drawer space. I was impressed wit the flatscreen tv with dvr.  Nice touch.   Only hiccup, was I felt my bedding wasn't clean.  I addressed that with the host and took care of it "
17092,43017026,17/8/15,1742661,Christian,Stayed the summer at Ralphs while working long hours at a financial institution. My room was fairly basic and small but worked fine for my simple needs. There was a cleaning person who came by sporadically. Ralph was in Europe for most of the time but communication was pretty fluid. Good food and nightlife in the hood. Only downsides were that it's on 4th floor of a walkup and the neighbors were loud at times. Overall a good experience. 
17092,48509593,27/9/15,25400648,Daniel,"Ralph was a very welcoming host from the very beginning and was always asking how my stay was to make sure everything was fine. His area of Hell's Kitchen has many great restaurants nearby and is very close to Times square which was convenient. His apartment is on the fourth floor of the apartment and there is not an elevator, so just prepare accordingly. Other than that I would definitely return if I come back to New York. "
17092,53805568,13/11/15,9199550,Paula,"Vivir en casa de Ralph ha sido una gran experiencia. Está estupendamente situada, cerca del metro, de Times Square y la zona de musicales de Broadway. Central Park está a unos minutos, y la zona de la Ópera y el Ballet también queda cerca. Sí queréis hacer deporte, el Hudson River Park está al lado.
Ralph ha sido un gran anfitrión. Se ha preocupado por que estuviese a gusto, habla perfectamente varios idiomas y tiene un inmejorable gusto musical.
La habitación es muy bonita y cómoda. Es amplia, la cama es muy cómoda y cuenta con todas las comodidades. La cocina es pequeña pero funcional, igual que el baño.
Repetiría sin dudarlo."

We did not meet Robin personally.  We did everything by phone and felt quite comfortable in our dealings with her.  She made herself available by phone if she was needed which she was not because everything was perfect for us.  Robin seems like a very kind and very organized person. She was truly interested in making sure that we had a pleasant stay.  We did. We would definitely contact her again."

The neighbourhood is nice and it was a short walk to the subway and different restaurants and shops. I would always recommend Robin as a host! 
17226,1154075,20/4/12,1426564,Régine,"Very well located apartment, near the subway (lines 1,2,3) and Central Park. Robin is very kind and helpful. Communication with her was friendly, easy and reliable. She gave us information on places to visit in NY, on good restaurants and so on. The apartment is comfortable, with 2 separate bedrooms and a living room with a small kitchen. I would definitely recommend Robin's place. Thanks a lot Robin!

17226,1569076,26/6/12,2548078,Robert,"Temperature control during warm weather a problem. Couldn't get comfortable sleeping. Bed liens sub standard. Stayed one nite then left. Unit very cluttered.



"
17226,1843569,30/7/12,2744265,Chris,"First, I'd like to say that Robin was a very accommodating host.  She worked with the four of us to ensure that we were all able to sleep comfortably.  The apartment is in an excellent location and the unit itself was clean.  We were only able to hear the neighbors when they were in the hallway.

The only cleanliness issue we had was with a giant cockroach in the cramped elevator.  The hallways were also a bit dark.

Something to note about this unit is that the owner lives here most of the time, so staying here feels kind of like house-sitting for somebody you don't know.  It's a Manhattan apt; so it's small and full of things like family pictures, clothing, and plants (that need to be watered).  I only bring this up because my previous rental experiences were essentially second homes that the owners rented out to make a little side money.  The fridges, cabinets, and shelves were empty so the experience was more like a hotel without all of the formality.  This wasn't necessarily a bad thing.  It was a bit off an odd experience for me so I figured I'd point it out."
17226,1958847,12/8/12,2945429,David,"Robin was a wonderful host - gave us some good information on what to see (and where to shop). The location was perfect, just a few minutes from the downdown subway and Central Park with lots of terrific places to eat within a ten minute walk. Despite it being very warm and humid during our stay, the window air conditioning was more than enough to make the apartment comfortable for sleeping. I would highly recommend Robin's place - and in fact my wife and daughter hope to be able to stay there when they make their next shopping trip to NYC."
17226,3785668,14/3/13,2088335,Tim,"Robin's place is awesome! Right in the middle of the action, I had a great two night in NYC, all thanks to Robin. In fact, when two friends decided to join the trip last minute, Robin was very accommodating. 

Delis, Diners, Jazz Bars and the subway are all right outside the doorway of this beautiful building from the early 1900's. If you want an authentic experience in the upper west side, this is your place.

Thanks Robin! Hope to be able to rent from you again"
17226,4713080,21/5/13,5918915,Florence & Jean-Marie,"Robin's apartment is very comfortable, with a large and pleasant bedroom and living room. It is well situated, with all you need in front of the building: groceries, pharmacy, breakfast shop and the N°1 metro line not far. Nice walks in Central park at 10 minutes. Robin  has been very thoughtful towards us, before our arrival and also after, giving us practical instructions for use of everything. We felt at ease, like at home. 
Appartement très bien situé et pratique avec une hôtesse accueillante à l'esprit pratique. Bonne adresse que nous recommandons."
17226,5475458,1/7/13,6786467,Elena,"Robin was very accomodating  with our check in time.  My husband and I were very satisifed with our stay at her apartment.  We had everything we needed including a hair dryer, iron and ironing board that Robin so graciously provided.  The apartment was clean and very conveniently located.  Would highly recommend!"
17226,6371574,10/8/13,7386315,Nancy,"Robin was a helpful and friendly host. She provided us with lots of information about places to visit, restaurants, events, and so on. It was my first time with Airbnb and it was a great experience. I stayed at Robin's apt for 10 nights with my sister and we really enjoyed our stay at Robin’s place. The apt was comfortable and had everything we needed, we felt like at home. The location is perfect and the neighbourhood is very nice. I would definitely recommend Robin's place.

17226,6925181,30/8/13,261251,Alexi,Robin is a great host! We booked a trip at a short notice with no problem. Robin was travelling but responded right away and was able to arrange for someone to meet us. The communications were clear and instructions helpful. The apartment was clean and welcoming. The area is great for anyone who wants to live and explore the city as a true New Yorker.
17226,7414010,19/9/13,5882473,Katherine,We found this property was in a handy location and well priced for Manhattan. It has a good amount of sunlight. I would probably only recommend it comfortably for a couple or 2 adults and a child as the 2nd bedroom (study) requires a blow up mattress and was quite uncomfortable for my mum. There was no space for putting away clothes in drawers or cupboards as the apartment is very much in use by the owner and tends to be quite a squeeze as there is a lot of stuff. Overall however we enjoyed our stay & Robin was very friendly.
17226,7981145,11/10/13,7628735,Eivind V,"We didn't have a chace to meet her, but everything went smooth and she answered all questions quickly. Her nest was very homely. "
17226,9155634,9/12/13,7728861,Linda,Robin was very friendly and accepted our reservation upon short notice. The first night she ended up having to stay so we got a price reduction for that night. The location is great however the apartment is very cluttered and a little messy. 
17226,21468610,18/10/14,20830767,Michael,"Первый раз арендовал жилье через этот сайт. Непривычно;) квартира идеальна по расположению - рядом с центральным парком. До метро 5 минут пешком. Хозяйка очень заботливая. Необычно было жить в квартире, где повсюду лежат вещи хозяев: косметика в ванной, полотенца хозяев, личные вещи... Чувствовалось присутствие хозяев каждую минуту;) для меня это необычно."
17226,21624844,20/10/14,22209566,John,She was fantastic-  great apartment-great location! Easy
17226,26664261,16/2/15,12458155,Byron,"Robin was great.  She explained everything very clearly before we came.  The keys were left at a very nearby doorman, easy for me to pickup because I got in late at night.  The location was clean and convenient.  Definitely recommend!"
17226,29851757,13/4/15,29318725,David,"Robin didn't just direct us to her place, she met us on the street (VERY helpful!) -- her warm & generous spirit was a delight.  The apartment was precisely as it had been described, absolutely charming, nothing negative.  The location was ideal, with easy access to coffee/breakfast.  As a musician, it was fun to ""talk shop"" with her in that regard.  Our experience with Robin & her home was dee-lightful!"
17226,30405000,21/4/15,13875120,Ronnie,"Love the neighborhood and the apt. Robin left us clear instructions as well as suggestions for the restaurants and such in the neighborhood.  Best of all, when our flight home was cancelled and we asked about possibility of staying another night, she was willing to adjust her own schedule and plans to make it happen. Close to subway and Central Park.  Great stay."
17226,32633757,19/5/15,29033371,Maya,"So Robin is an amazing host, kind, and comfortable. I recommend staying with her, it was fantastic - the place, the location and the host all were top notch! "
17226,33068650,25/5/15,26924552,Daniel,"Robin was and excellent host; from the first interaction of the process of renting until she handed the keys to her apartment. Her place is very spacious, extremely well located and most important very clean when we received it. All in all it was and excellent experience.

17226,34838859,12/6/15,16808509,Ann,"Robin was a wonderful host. We were very appreciative of her flexibility in accommodating our last-minute stay. Her welcome was the ideal combination of warmth and hospitality while allowing enough personal space for us to feel like it was ""our"" place during our stay. "
17226,41563188,7/8/15,38578081,Santiago,robin very nice and good person !! But the only thing that we dont like is that in the pictures was available the main rom and finally was not!
17226,47302375,17/9/15,42916892,Jane,"We had a great night at Robin's Nest: space, comfort and cleanliness. Also information, for newcomers to New York plus a village feel to the neighbourhood, with Central and Riverview parks closeby and quick transport to downtown. Thank you Robin for a great welcome to NYC in your appartement, which has such character.
Jane"
17226,50523367,12/10/15,3576827,Nick,"While my schedule did not allow me to meet with Robin directly, she went out of her way to ensure I arrived and checked in without any issues.  We were in contact several times by phone and Robin left a very complete set of instructions.  The apartment is clean and very well located in the upper west side.  Restaurants abound in the area and the subway is very handy"
17226,51405189,19/10/15,45683741,Matias,Robin was great. We spend one night and everything was perferct. Everything explained.
17226,103649059,23/9/16,1203072,Marie,"Robin  nous a très bien accueillis et elle fait vraiment confiance à ses hôtes . L'appartement est très bien situé , près du métro et de commerces . Du fait de sa situation sur Broadway , et de sorties de climatiseurs dans la cour sur laquelle donne la chambre à coucher  , il y a pas  mal de bruit la nuit. Les pièces sont grandes sauf la cuisine mais nous étions prévenus. L'appartement est très bien équipé  mais   la pièce principale et la cuisine  donnent  l'impression d'être  assez encombrées.   "
17226,107170044,9/10/16,22861231,Laurie,"Robin was a very gracious host!! She always responded in a timely manner and was very flexible with our check-in and check-out times. The apartment was in a fantastic location and close to lots of restaurants, bars, subway, etc.  By New York standards, this is a large apartment and It was nice having 2 bedrooms. Overall, we had a great experience and weekend!!"
17226,143600811,12/4/17,1591510,Anne,"It's a great space but decor is dated and there is alot of personal stuff lots of which is very dated too so if you're looking for sleek, modern, mimimalist design this is not for you. The neighborhood is great.  It's noisy though so if you're not used to New York you may not be able to sleep. Constant fire trucks poice sirens and car horns at all hours.  Robin communicates well and is available if you need anything 
Living room exposed to building across because there are no window coverings except plants 
Office room blinds afford privacy but they are very old.  Kitchen tiny bit she tells you this.  Great old NYC place. Beautiful art that she painted herself "
17226,144040134,14/4/17,72146036,Suzanne,"Robin graciously welcomed me to her home and provided lots of information on the neighborhood, including where to find the best happy hour! The apartment is conveniently located near the subway, but was reasonably quiet. (It IS New York!) I only stayed one night, and the location was exactly what I needed."
17226,144876576,16/4/17,319935,Deborah,"Robin was welcoming and communicative, and she was accommodating when we needed flexibility with our check-in time. She went out of her way to be helpful, and she made us feel at home."
17226,146768463,23/4/17,1967757,Christine,Great location.  Very spacious for NYC.  Characterful building and apartment.  Robins communication was very good
17226,157784755,4/6/17,14721943,Deborah,"Robin's place is exactly as advertised.   While it might not be right for everyone, it's a perfectly comfortable,  true pre-war upper Westside homebase from which to explore the nyc's vast wealth of culture.  "
17226,160324269,13/6/17,46086385,Kshitiz,"Robin's place was great, and she is great host. Would love to stay again in future."

17226,249049365,1/4/18,3859528,Jake,"I had a great stay at Robin's place! It is very spacious (we were three guests), has nice light and is as it appears in the listing's photos.  The location was perfect for our trip (location in UWS and proximity to subway lines), and appreciated her communication through the whole experience."
17226,256393850,22/4/18,41729648,Hannah,Robin is a great host and her place is really wonderful. We especially appreciated her willingness to accommodate our check-in and check-out needs! The apartment is cozy and located in a beautiful old school New York building. Thanks for a great stay!
17226,259203105,30/4/18,88384359,Rachel,"Robin's place is in a great area, and is airy and sweet with excellent natural light. We enjoyed the recommendations she provided, and felt like locals during our time there."
17226,268986057,26/5/18,57666249,Lexi,This place is amazing! Good location nearby everything. Robin is a nice host. Very very very lovely decoration in room. It makes me feel I am back to home.
17226,283325949,29/6/18,8597570,Lois,"My daughter Lauren and I really enjoyed our stay at Robin's lovely, comfortable apartment, and living a little bit like New Yorkers for a while.  The main bed was comfortable, and by all accounts from my daughter, as was the air mattress in the second bedroom.  We had fun negotiating the tiny kitchen-in-a-cupboard and actually managed to squeeze both our slim bodies in there at the same time on occasions!  There is quite a bit of outside noise during the night, but with ear plugs, or with the bedroom fan running, we had no problem sleeping.  There was nowhere much to hang clothes, but there were spare coathangers which we made use off by utilizing any hooks we could find around the place.  You will grow to love Robin's pot plants as you care for them with a drink of water every couple of days.  The location is great, with all assortment of cafes, delis, grocery and other stores, laundries, gluten-free bakery, and the subway and buses just a short stroll away.  All things considered, we really enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to return if we were to ever visit New York again."
17240,24497,20/1/10,66859,Mario,"Was verry nice to stay there. Brooklin is an upcoming area, and their home clean, and quite. Next trip to big apple we will book for sure."
17240,25203,31/1/10,71118,Eli,"Staying here was probably the best choice that I have ever made going to NYC. The rooms and bathrooms are excellent. The service was friendly and professional. The internet was blazing fast, and I love the soul food restaurant located a few blocks away.

I suggest this place to anyone who is going to NYC and needs affordable accommodations. We will definitely be back."
17240,27422,23/2/10,80761,Marie-Laure,"I had a wonderful time in Cozy Suite Inn. The place is so quite, bright and nice. I nearly felt at home, and the district is really cool,
with a good location, not too far from the subway that leads directly to manhattan in twenty minutes. I thank Greg and Thais for their welcoming. I did not even need to ask them for anything else than staying there."
17240,32220,29/3/10,97216,Annabelle,
17240,35954,16/4/10,8294,Jo,"My daughter and I stayed 3 nights in the Citadelle. I agree with the others who stayed here--the place was clean, surprisingly quiet, and Thais was very nice. The neighborhood did worry us at first but turned out to be fine. It's quite a bargain. (Tho' I also would love to see a microwave put in, as someone suggested!) I'd recommend it."
17240,38708,29/4/10,94089,Carlos,"I just stayed at the Cozysuite inn and it was a good experience. I slept like a baby and the other travelers I met where nice and interesting. Thais was a good host and she was very attentive to my needs even helping me get a cab on my last day when i left to the airport. The apt is located i Brooklyn and its only a 8 min walk to the subway which takes you straight into Manhattan. So very convenient, overall i would recommend this place if you want to get a good feel for what it is to be a New Yorker. "
17240,42602,15/5/10,102633,Douglas,"Separately-locked master bedroom in third-floor, 3-bedroom apartment with shared kitchen & living room.  Very clean room completely empty except for full-size bed--no closet, dresser, alarm clock, mirror, shelves, etc.  $15/night add-on taken out of deposit for private use of the attached bathroom is totally worth it considering the base rental price.  Also nice is the private (apartment-only) access to the roof where there are two patio chairs.  Living room has couch, TV, and wi-fi (ask for password).  There's also a folding card table and chairs, dishes and cookware.

Nice, well-shaded block seems fairly safe; however, 8-block walk to A-train stop at Utica got progressively worrisome as the weekend approached, but I never walked alone and nothing happened. Never saw a restaurant nearby; seemed to be only 24-hr convenient stores which also sold sandwiches, bagels, coffee, etc.

Because of the bargain price alone, I'd give it 5-stars, but was inconvenienced by host.  Confirmed at 3PM that I'd be landing at 5:30 and was told would be met ""after 6:30"".  I had to wait in 45-degree rain in Williamsburg til 9:30PM (there's no obvious safe place to hang out in host's neighborhood) so wasn't able to see planned concert.  Emailed multiple times weeks before that my departure flight was at 8PM and needed confirm arrival time of next guest so that I wouldn't be lugging bags around after noon check-out.  Was told $20 for additional 12 hours, but received text message at 1:30am the night before check-out saying I needed to be out of room by 11:45am, then was charged same amount as if I had use of the room just to leave my bags unattended in living room where I was ""welcome to stay for late check-out"".  However, the 2 guests sharing the twin bedroom had taken the cushions off the couch, brought out the table and completely took over the living room.  In person, host was very sweet, even offering to arrange car to airport, but no apologies or concession for inconveniences.

Still would highly recommend with the caveat to adjust plans to get into Manhattan as it is a bit off the path (40-45min to the Guggenheim, for example) and to keep in constant contact with host."
17240,50360,6/6/10,129358,Patsy,"The room was ok, really basic.  Didn't see any bugs although we had been told by the previous people (who we got to meet) that they had seen a few... We were there for 3 days during a heat wave and a fan would have been helpful.  Difficult to get air in the room.  I had the room at the back (BTW, the ONLY one with a double bed!).  Felt a little guilty because there was a couple in the room next to me in what the owners call a double bed but is definitely more like a single bed.  2 rooms out of 3 have a single bed (hard for a couple when it's sooo hot outside).  The kitchen is quite unappealing with drawers falling half out... no urge to cook there!  Living room bare and lacking table, no desire to spend time in it. The room in the front (where my friend was staying) was very loud.  All night long, people drove with their music blasting. She NEVER slept! Also important to say that we NEVER in our 3 days there, saw another white person.  Felt scared although nothing happened BUT we were 2 girls and I WOULD NOT return there alone.  Other parts of Brooklyn feel MUCH safer.  This is definitely no hypster place!  The owner seemed nice, we only saw her once."
17240,51506,10/6/10,118047,Cindy,"Basic, clean, well situated, good welcome - a good place to stay if you need somewhere to crash in New York for a day or 2 !"
17240,63876,12/7/10,119252,Andreas,"we stayed 8 nights in cozysuite inn citadelle. the whole apartment is really clean and neat. during our stay there was a big heat over ny. which is bad as there is no air con in the apartment. but thais helped out with some fans! she's friendly! we experienced the neighborhood in bedford without any difficulties. some groceries around. j-train, a- and c-train  nearby. also busses to metro. summing up, it's a real bargain! although quite a ride to manhattan. i can recommend this place! ah, when you're two people, take only the citadelle as there is the only bed fitting two comfortably. "
17240,66480,19/7/10,146925,Cristina,"The house was fine, and the room clean and big enough for two. The only problem was that it was a bit far from the station and to come back at nights sometimes scaring because of the area, but during the day no problem at all."
17240,78437,14/8/10,7766,Elisa,"Cozysuite was everything that it was advertised to be - clean, comfortable, and an extraordinary bargain.  Yes, it was hot...but it was summer in NY...most homes in NY do not have air conditioning.  For those of you who are concerned, bring your own fan as I did (note: I didn't actually need it).  The accommodatians are a little far out, but still accessible by subway. Thais was very responsive and is willing to help make your stay a good one!"
17240,94457,10/9/10,225275,Camille,"We did not enjoy our stay very much but understand that $39/night for a place to stay in NY is rare. Nonetheless Cozysuite is making enough money from its guests to provide a decent sanitary couch and fix the 
broken drawer in the kitchen and keep the rooms a bit more decent.  Even more my husband and I woke up with mysterious bites on our arms and hands.  We've experienced bed bugs before and a sure sign are tiny mysterious droplets of blood on the sheet. Well we saw two of those... I'm just stating the facts here. 

I also personally did not like the unsure feeling from only being able to text the owners before arriving and not speaking to them and hgiving a $200 cash deposit without an offer of a receipt. Once I asked for a receipt I did receive one by e-mail the next day. No one wants to pay someone cash without a paper trail...

The building is in the Bedford Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn. This isn't the best part of Brooklyn but it was safe. We walked the streets from the subway after 2 am and were fine.

This is not a home stay - each person is also a visitor so you are not imposing on anybody's patch but by the same token it lacks the comforts of a home. "

17240,12264993,27/4/14,12132026,Eliza,"When we arrived to NYC from Colombia with our 20 month old baby it was very 
difficult to contact Thais. We had to stay in the airport two hours until i 
finally was able to get a hold of her when i told her we were going to head 
to her apartment to check in she stated we had to pay an additional $30.00 
fee for an early check in which she never mentioned before. The apartment 
was in really bad shape, locks did not work, toilet did not flush properly, 
mildew on the shower curtain and extensive water damage on walls and 
ceilings. On top of everything the apartment was really filthy and terribly 
cold. We also noticed bugs on both wood floors and on the bed. We asked our 
host for a broom and a mop so we can clean the place and not have our baby 
girl in those conditions she replied she would loan us the utensils to 
clean but never did. Also in our 2nd night at her place she had an issue 
with us leaving a sealed loaf of bread, and bananas. After all this she 
knocked at our door telling us we could not have our 20 month old baby 
running in the apartment as it was bothering other guests. Overall I would 
not whatsoever recommend this place to anyone. It is just not worth saving 
a few bucks. The area is also very sketchy and we did not feel safe at all 
walking after 5pm. We ended up leaving in our 3rd day there due to the 
condition of the place and the constant complaints by our host."
17240,35098566,15/6/15,1008809,Carole,"The welcome was not very warm, very minimalist.
Housing is far from the center of Manathan (about 1h / 1h30 by train by the express) which is very inconvenient if you want to stand out in the evening after a day of visit.
The room was clean (according to photos ), but without any storage convenience (only a portico with a few hangers ). We did not have the requested twin bed (inability to control this option online, and there, they no longer accept payment ), ventilation in the bathroom did not work,light hallways , kitchen/dining room did not work several times (at our request, only a part of the light bulbs was changed). The TV worked the first few days, then no more remote control batteries that have not been changed, despite our claim.
The entrance doesn't look like the pictures, it is very cluttered with personal belongings of host.
Please note this is not at all a bed & breakfast ! The only convenience provided are towels and sheets. In the kitchen, few utensils, no dish soap (Sheila eventually give us one). In the bathroom, only 1 roll of toilet paper and a half for 2 weeks for 2 people (this was also visibly us to buy it).
At the end of our stay we wanted to enjoy the late -checking option to $20 as listed in the description, as our flight was Sunday at 21h. I told the host before arriving and they had replied that they were not able to give us at this time. It actually turned out that they no longer offered the option at all for several months! The morning of the day before departure note, she was ready to give it to us for $30. At night, she could finally not because absent the day of our departure. So we had to pack our bags on Saturday evening (very nice last night in New York) and leave for the airport on Sunday morning at 9am to leave our baggages, then return on Manathan to spend the day, and return to the airport in the evening.
To note, there is absolutely nothing to do in the neighborhood, but it's a pretty safe, at no time we felt unsafe.
ITo sum up, minimum service even non-existent, a place I would not recommend."

Great double story space for the 6-8ppl in our group, plenty of bedding & Nicolas & Chris were very helpful when we needed a few more blankets. 5min walk to the subway & 20mins to manhattan on the A-train. Easy & quick access to JFK & La Guardia. After staying in Manhattan our past couple of visits it was great to experience Brooklyn. We'll be back!!"
17297,1310073,20/5/12,2158317,Salomo P.,"Place was fine, but quite dirty. We had to clean it ourselves. Neighbors upstairs are very noisy. Chair in the living room is totally dirty that we needed to cover it with something before sitting.

Nevertheless, host's assistant is ready whenever needed. And the availability of place is highly reliable. It's not a scam."
17297,1550200,24/6/12,2454412,Pablo,"The department is nice, only problem it has is that it really doesnt have 3 bedrooms: one bd is inthe living room, one bedroom (very big and nice) in the basement and to go to that room you have to go through another room, so you should have that in account. Chris and and Nicolas are very helpful people, always available."
17297,2280052,14/9/12,2472012,Nick,"Nicholas and his assistant Chris are a very kind person. Concacts with both of them were fast and easy. The apartment is nice even though the basement has no windows. But we were provided with air conditionated and fens. It is 10 minutes far from two subway stations.
The apartment is good for people who uses it for travelling and holidays and stays not much in it. The price is really the best I could find in NYC. As you usually take 30/40 minutes to Manhattan it is not much convenient to come back home more than once a day.
Thank you Nicholas. We enjoyed our stay in NYC. Hope to meet you... next time!"

L'appartement était très agréable et peut parfaitement contenir un grand groupe, bien que l'agencement des pièces manque cruellement d'intimité ( nous étions deux couples + deux amis). C'est cependant le seul bémol que nous pouvons trouver à cet appartement, très bien équipé, très proche de la station de métro (qui dessert très bien Manhattan). Nicolas et Chris, son assistant, ont été très présents pour nous depuis le jour de notre réservation.

17297,7395734,18/9/13,141581,Nicolás,"Chris is a nice person but unfortunately during our stay  we had a mice problem in the apartment. They told us that this was a normal issue in NY. They gave us two options: to stay or to leave.  However, we did not feel comfortable and did not want to stay there anymore. In the end we left  and they gave us back part of the money for the remaining nights. This was a pain in the ass because we missed an entire day looking and moving to another place. I Personally think that they should have gave us a full refund because we had to spend so much money in this process and this wasn't our fault.

He addressed my concerns regarding the past negative reviews. Then I made my first, hopefully of many, Airbnb booking. The unit was very spacious with clean sheets, towels and very good water pressure. We were 3 adults staying there for 1 week. We had more than enough room to socialize or to have alone time. The location is a short stroll to restaurants and shops. The subway station is a 5 min walk away. 
I had a great time exploring Brooklyn and Manhattan. I will check Airbnb first after booking my next holiday."

His assistant Chris was also great to deal with, and together they made the logistics easy and hassle-free.  We were 11 people in this unit, and being two floors, it worked out well regarding living space and sleeping space. Other than some minor cosmetics, this apt is clean, in good shape, and the location is fantastic - the neighborhood is really great with friendly corner stores. There is a great little grocery store with lots of fresh produce, a deli, hot meals and a juice bar, about a 3 minute walk away. Peaches restaurant is also just a short walk to the corner and the food is great. The apt also easy access to the Metro etc. For a big group like we had, this place was fantastic, and we will definitely be contacting Nicolas again when we return to NYC. Thanks Nicolas & Chris!"

 Nicolaksen asunnossa meitä oli  12 henkilöä joten viisi ensimmäistä yötä ja yksi kylpyhuone oli haaste. Tuntuu todella luksukselta viettää kaksi viimeistään yötä talon ylimmissä kerroksissa joissa meillä oli kaksi kylpyhuonetta ja keittiötä. Yläkerran asunnot olivat valoisampia ja kodikkaampia.

The kitchen was stocked well with plates, bowls, cups and utensils for everyone, and we were able to prepare simple meals like eggs, rice and spam, and instant ramen noodles.  WiFi worked well, we were able to stream Netflix. The apartment is only a 10 minute leisurely walk to the A/C trains that will take you to Manhattan. Our party was mostly women so our mornings were a bit long trying to get everyone to shower in the single bathroom. My only qualms with this apartment was the stiffness and unevenness of the mattress I slept on. I can't speak for all the beds, but the full size bed directly in front of the bottom of the stairs was a little hard on my back. Other than that, my family and I really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it for other larger parties!"

The sheets were dirty; we washed them (Nicolas reimbursed us cleaning). Housekeeping had not been done before our arrival. Il had cockroaches and other creepy creatures. There is a removable air conditioning in each room but it does an infernal noise; unfortunately you have to leave the switch because otherwise he would very hot. The piece in the basement is extremely wet. There is a dehumidifier but it must empty the bin every two hours. This is a housing for 12 people; we were ten but the dining table is only for eight.

Il conviendrait bien à une famille avec enfants. Il est situé dans un quartier sympathique et calme à 10 mn d'une station de métro. Après une journée entière à arpenter New York nous avons apprécié ce quartier à l'architecture typique. A proximité on peut faire quelques achats alimentaires de base et manger dans un restaurant de tapas ou une pizzeria d'excellente qualité. Le métro met 20 à 50 minutes pour se rendre à Manhattan selon les quartiers. Le propriétaire Nicolas était absent mais nous avons pu le joindre facilement par téléphone et par mail.

It didn't bothered us because it was not so expensive but it is clearly not an apartment for more than 10 people: there was not enough place around the table, it was a bit complicated in the morning to have only one bathroom (with the toilets inside) and there was no window in the basement (with most of the beds) nor in the bedroom. 
However, the apartment has several good points: it was very easy to communicate with Chris, the host's assistant (we could check in and out at the hour we wanted), the inner courtyard was really pleasant, and, most of all, it was really well located (really close to the subway, many nice restaurants and shops)."

Good value for money.
Only negative: MICE/RATS! The kitchen/1st bedroom area comes alive at night with squeals from rodents and them rustling around the kitchen. Also came one night to a dead mouse in the kitchen. 
I didnt mind too much but it was hard to sleep with all the noise and sometimes it did smell of rodents. I would suggest getting in a exterminator."

Jeg vil ikke anbefale mere en 6 pga. eet toilet og meget få ting i køkkenet. Huset er meget charmerede og ligger dejligt lige overfor en pæn og stor skole. Utica stationen er tæt på og dermed nem adgang til Manhatten og der er mange skønne restaurater i området. Inden for et par hundrede meter er der både lækker morgenmadscafe og hyggelig restaurant og supermarked.  Området er på ""vej op"" men stadig måske ikke det bedste og tryggeste om natten.

We never saw or spoke with Nicolas, but Chris, his assistant, was very helpful and always gave us everything we needed. 
The location could be better - it is NOT 2 blocks from the subway station, as mentioned. It's more like a 7-10 minute walk. The subway ride to Manhattan is about 15 minutes to the downtown area. about 45 minutes to central Manhattan (Central Park area). There is a very nice restaurant downstairs, many little markets (some even 24/7. Convenient!) and a big supermarket less than 10 minutes away!
Overall, we had a great stay at Modern Brownstone Living 3. We would defiantly stay there again and recommend this apartment to our friends!"
17298,2955581,25/11/12,3423300,Erin,"Nicolas was very responsive when we were booking and also tried to work with us when we were concerned about whether to cancel our trip after Hurricane Sandy. His associate Chris was at the Brownstone as scheduled when we arrived and 15 minutes early at our departure with our deposit of cash in hand which worked well for us. The Modern Brownstone was almost exactly what we expected, perhaps even slightly larger then the pictures show. We ended up bringing only 3 of our 4 children which was good because I think it would have been a bit tight with too large boys sharing a trundle bed in the living room. Our only real complaint about the Brownstone would be the heating. It was almost unbearably hot when we arrived and continued to be erratic throughout our stay. Mostly we left all the windowns open 24-7 to cool off but it led to some uncomfortable sleeping at times. The apartment was acceptably clean and there were a few cleaning supplies and adequate kitchen items for our use. Enough clean towels and iinens for everyone. I was pleasantly surprised to find a hairdryer in the bathroom. This is not a good choice if those using the master bedroom are looking for privacy as everyone has to walk through the master to get to the one bathroom. The best part of this Brownstone was the location. A short walk from the subway and super-easy to get from JFK and into Manhattan and other parts of Brooklyn. We all bought $29 weekly MTA passes and never once took a cab. There are several convenience stores with fruit, vegetables, sandwiches, etc. and also laundromats nearby if you needed one (we did not). Peaches restaurant 2 blocks away is amazingly good food and we ate there twice. There is also a great coffee shop two doors down from there and several decent bars all within a few blocks. For a family of 5 traveling on a tight budget I would recommend this place for sure. We only once felt a little unsafe in the neighborhood and that was in broad daylight. It is right across from an elementary school and the neighborhood is very settled and residential. I would not recommend this area however for those who are uncomfortable with being in the minority or don't know there way around a big city. "

17298,7720556,30/9/13,8620621,Ivona,"If you are looking for nice, quiet, affordable and clean place to stay in NYC then this can be it. 

The apartment looks exactly as on the pictures. No luxus, but everything essential. First I was bit sceptical about security but it was only because we have different buildings and building standards here in Europe. It was actually really safe with the middle school across the street. What is important is that apartment was really clean - no hair, no bugs, no bedbugs, clean towels and clean bedsheets. Soap, toilet paper, trash bags and some cleaning supplies were provided. Kitchen is well equipped. And in the night there was actually very quiet, no need for earplugs. WiFi was working well. Hot water all day long.

In the neighborhood there was nice restaurant and groceries nearby. In the grocery store there is this charming older shop assistant - we liked him very much :-) However, as is mentioned in earlier review here - this neighborhood is not for those who are not comfortable being in minority. But it was really safe and in the nearby park there were men playing the chess during the evenings.

Utica subway station is few minutes away and it is the direct line to Manhattan. Please be aware that smaller stations don`t have escalators and lifts so be careful when you have heavier luggage as we did.

Communication with Nicolas and his assistant Chris was smooth. Responses were quick, they were really reliable and left us their email addresses and phone numbers. There was no problem with security deposit either.

Overall - I would definitely recommend this apartment. It was lovely, new and enriching experience for us :-) Thank you :-)"

La prestation est à minima, une réelle négligence concernant la propreté des fenêtres (à mettre sur le compte du système d'ouverture en guillotine + moustiquaires qui rendent inaccéssibles les vitres extérieures). Quelques problèmes de robinetterie qui doivent être résolus aujourd'hui. La vue principale donne sur une rue arboré face à une école. La vue sur cours est ... indigne. Chris, l'assistant, est accessible, serviable, sympa. Une grande souplesse pour les ''Check-In'' & ''Check-out''. Globalement, si 1 système de notation existait, la note serait de 6/10."
17298,17742712,17/8/14,14350282,Alfiya,"Thanks to Nicolas and his deputy Chris for good accomodation! The apartments were clean, there was everything what we expected and the owner always was in touch and quickly responsed on all our questions.
The location of the apartment is really good (near subway stations, good cafe Brunswick and restourant Peaches, food shops).
Our stay (we are 3 friends) was really nice!"

Our freind was concerned when we said we were staying in Bedstuy, but we found no reason to worry. Neighbors were friendly, street was quiet, walked to subway entrance several times without concern. Left car in street parking without incident. One point:  the third bed is actually in the same room as the kitchen/eating area. Not a problem, but it was hard to see in the pictures. Wholly enjoyable week! Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

We previously stayed here in the fall while working in Brooklyn (but in two different apartments in the building). We liked it so much, we came back. Nicolas is excellent at communicating and accommodating our various check-in / check-out needs. The neighborhood is great, and the building and apartments within are quite charming.

Thank you for another great stay!"

17298,262639968,9/5/18,5504329,Henry,"We enjoyed Nicola‘s place a lot. 
Nicolas made things very easy for us.
The apartment is far enough from the city to give you a neighborhood feel, yet well connected to Manhattan and Brooklyn."
17298,277110923,15/6/18,6768148,Marlen,"We loved this apartment. The locations is perfect, and the neighborhood super nice! The apartment was super clean, we had everything we needed (sheets, towels etc.) We were between 3-4 people and shared all rooms. Important to know is maybe that the bedroom has no extra door so people will have to walk through there to reach the bathroom. Nonetheless this wasn't much of a problem to us. 

Overall Nicolas was an amazing host who always answered within seconds and made this stay perfect for us!"
17298,319490405,6/9/18,203965910,Aninze,A great place to stay with your family.

17299,1163566,22/4/12,1858033,Kelly,"The apartment was a lot like extended executive housing. The place was huge, and a great value for the number of people it could host in the city. It was very convenient to public transit. Nicolas and his assistant, Chris were extremely easy to work with and accommodating with check-in and check-out times, and the apartment was as described in the listing.

One word of caution - I'll say that while the place was just what we needed, my friend and I did have a crime incident in the neighborhood. If you plan to come and go late at night, I'd recommend caution. "
17299,1209551,1/5/12,1859953,Anastasia,"Nicolas has a very nice apartment, which is located in Brooklyn, 40 minutes by subway to Manhattan. Near by it placed a wonderful restaurant ""Peaches"" with a great food. Apartment is nice and very budget, and Nicolas and Lewis (his host) are very nice and great."

17299,4967765,4/6/13,5907300,Alexander,"The neighbourhood is wonderfull - green, quite but quite close to the next subway station. Nicolas´ assistant was anxious to be of service where and whenever it was neccessary and the communication worked without any problems. The technical standard might be a bit different to a western european but everything was clean and that´s basically the reason for travelling this (authentic) way.... 
Summary: A recomenndable place. "
17299,5499827,2/7/13,7059400,Nessa,We had a lovely time in Nicolas' apartment. Nicolas and Chris were very obliging and very responsive to any queries or requests. The apartment is very spacious and comfortable. We would highly recommend it as a place to stay in New York.

Die Kommunikation mit Chris dem Housekeeper zwecks check in/out verlief problemlos. Bis zur Subway sind es fünf Min. zu fuss und von da ca 20- 25  min bis inmitten Manhatten --perfekt ! In der Umgebung befinden zahlreiche Deli/ 24 Kioske und ein Supermarkt für das nötigste.

Nicolas a été très compréhensif et arrangeant pour les dates de séjour. Son logement est idéalement placé à Brooklyn, non loin du métro pour toutes les visites sur Manhattan. Côté confort et entretien, un petit rafraichissement serait bienvenu, mais l'appartement est assez spacieux pour quatre. Le quartier est calme, face à une école, et Chris est très discret mais attentif. "
17299,21302520,14/10/14,15680731,Sabine,"The apartment was clean and tidy and basic things were provided. But literally only the basics. The kitchen was as good as (Website hidden by Airbnb) oil, vinegar, pepper. Other than that it was good to spend the night. Everything looks a little bit more spacious on the pictures but it's more than enough to stay there with a group of two or three. The shower was a little hard to handle and the apartment is not taken care of with a lot of love but as I said it's alright if you're just visiting the city. The next Metro Stops are in 5-10 minutes walking distance which is fine. Groceries and a wine market are also right around the corner. Chris took care of our check-in and check-out which worked out fine and we were also able to leave the suitcases in his office since our flight wasn't until after check-out time. "

Die Wohnung liegt in einer ruhigen Gegend. Die ""Linie A"" ist in ca. 8 Min. - zu Fuß - erreichbar. Man ist nach rund 25 Min. Fahrtzeit Mitten in Manhatten oder am JFK-Flughafen. Das ist perfekt! 
In der Umgebung befinden einige Delis und einen Supermarkt. In unmittelbarer Nähe sind auch zwei Bars/Restaurants. Schauen sehr nett aus, ausprobiert haben wir sie allerdings nicht, da wir meisten in Manhatten unterwegs waren.
Die Wohnung ist zwar schon ein bisschen abgewohnt, aber sauber. Wir waren zu 5 und haben uns sehr wohlgefühlt.   Ein gutes Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis . Wir würden wieder buchen.  "

Neighborhood is friendly and calm (despite it's initial appearance to someone flying in from Europe). Very well connected to the JFK airport and downtown/midtown Manhattan. Housekeeper was friendly and approachable, he even waited for us for 3hrs when our arrival was delayed by airport services (ty Chris). Would recommend. 
"
17299,30875854,28/4/15,27696289,Abel,"Good ""Brooklyn"" experience. Neighborhood is calm and safe and subway is close, but it takes 30 min to mid-Manhattan. Apartment is cozy and comfortable for 5-6 people. The best is Chris who is avalaible for any problem that can arise. Thanks Chris. The only issues are how to manage the shower the first day and the fine curtains in main room ( if you want to sleep during the day). Overall Great family experience."

The Utica avenue metro is 7 min walk and connects very well. The neighbourhood is quiet and peaceful. The only drawback we had was that we had only one toilet-bathroom, but then we knew about it when we booked and managed this constraint. Chris provided with extra fan promptly, much appreciate it. Shops are nearby for quick grocery purchase and we found ourselves at ease. Thanks for a wonderful experience."

Habían toallas, jabón, sabanas limpias, detergente, esponja, vajilla. Mucho mejor que un hotel. El lugar muy seguro y el barrio tambien. Volviamos en subte entre las 11 de la noche y 1 de la mañana y nos sentimos muy seguros caminando por la zona con las bolsas de compras. De hecho hay locales abiertos a esa hora. El anfitrion nos recibio muy amablemente, de hecho, yo me confundi con el horario de llegada (llegue 12 horas antes) y el dueño soluciono el problema al instante. El lugar esta a 50 min del empire state, entre caminar, esperar el subte, pero no nos importo, porq la zona es hermosa! Lo recomiendo mucho. No defrauda."

Me recibió Chris, el asistente de Nicolas, quien fue muy amable y atento a nuestras solicitudes.

El apartamento es acogedor y perfecto para 8 personas, lo encontramos limpio y ordenado, como ya les había comentado, se encuentra a 4 cuadras de 2 estaciones del subway ( en donde pasan las lineas A y C) que te llevan directamente a Manhattan en 25 min, la zona es muy tranquila, casi todos los días llegábamos alrededor de la medianoche y era seguro.

Es totalmente recomendable para un grupo mayor a 7 personas.

En conclusión, es muy buen sitio para rentar ya que la comodidad y la ubicación del apartamento permiten conocer tranquilamente NYC."

Appartement parfait pour 4 d'une même famille mais petit pour 7 personnes de 2 familles du fait qu'il y a une seule salle de bain et un seul WC. Les lits confortables, les draps propres ainsi que le linge de maison. La cuisine est un peu minimaliste en terme d'équipement.
Les escaliers sont assez raides donc pas facile si vous avez des difficultés de mobilité  
Il faudrait faire un petit effort sur le ménage car il n'est pas au top. Le quartier ne craint pas, et assez sympa avec pas mal de petits resto et de bar a proximité
  Il est bien situé car à 5 min d'une station de métro directe vers Manhattan (Ligne A ou C)
Une personne, Chris vous accueillera et vous donnera toutes les infos nécessaires a votre séjour et il est la tout le temps si vous avez un souci avec le logement.
On vous le recommande car il est très agréable

The room and all shared spaces were comfortable, clean, and had that cozy vibe you feel when you are somewhere with lots of love in it.

The apartment is literally next door to the subway entrance, and there are many cool things to explore nearby - food, book stores, and nice places to walk along the river.  I could go on and on... I would recommend this place to anyone (or any couple) looking to experience Harlem or NYC in general."

Beide sind großartige Gastgeber und fragen regelmäßig nach, ob man etwas braucht. Nach der Ankunft an einem heißen Sommerabend haben sie extra Eistee für meinen Jungen bereitgestellt.
In der näheren Umgebung finden sich jede Menge kleiner Läden, ca. 5 Gehminuten braucht man zum größeren Supermarkt.

The room was cozy and clean as was the bathroom, both of which lock from the inside. The experience was close to having the place to ourselves as our hosts and the other guest were not around very much during the hours we were there. They also have a rescue dog who we saw once or twice during our stay but wasn't around much either and didn't interact with us at all. They were extremely responsive to every message and helped us out extremely quickly when we had questions. Would definitely stay again!"

Very responsive and helpful hosts who are proactive in offering assistance but ensured my privacy. Great proximity to Yankee stadium. Room is definitely only big enough for one person. One can get to central Harlem (Sylvias, etc) on a single 20 mins bus ride that stops a block away. There is a lock on the inside of the bedroom and bath but no way to lock bedroom from outside when you leave if that's a big deal. I didn't have any problems. Pretty much everything a lone traveler needs on their way thru. Laundry and a small deli/convenience store next door."
17693,222401759,29/12/17,158145586,Nathan,"My partner and I recently took a trip to New York, and on our first night found out our hotel got our booking wrong. As a result we were left to find accommodation super last minute.
Tye and Etienne took on our booking without any hesitation 3 days before Christmas and went the extra effort to fix their bathroom up (renovations) in time for us to enjoy our stay.
Upon our arrival we were greeted by Etienne who showed us around the place and was sure to make us feel comfy.
Now this review could have easily continued into a normal 'stay and review' situation, but as fate would have it, not long after we arrived at Tye and Etienne's my parents called with a back-up plan to our hotel booking failure, and decided to put us up in NY without the need to continue our 6 days in the Airbnb.
At this stage that left us with an awkward conversation to be had with Etienne as we knew the effort the couple had put into the place and the arrangements they had made last minute to make our stay comfortable.
Although when we had this conversation Etienne was very understanding and considerate of the sudden change of plan and made the necessary calls to organize a win for both parties. 
Even though their preference was set to 'strict' for bookings and payments, Tye and Etienne made sure that both parties were comfortable with a 50/50 split payment and graciously refunded us half of our booking.
The ongoing communications between us were well managed and even though this wasn't a full stay at Tye and Etienne's residence i have full confidence that their home and hospitality would have been superb. The way they understood our situation and accommodated it on the fly was hands down a reason why I would recommend staying with these two to anyone looking for a relaxing, vibrant and welcoming stay within Harlem, NY.
Thanks again Tye and Etienne, will definitely be coming back on our next trip to NYC."

17693,256798526,23/4/18,124640324,Rafael,"200 feet from Subway. Very lively neighborhood, short walk to Harlem, Hamilton Heights."
17693,259201765,30/4/18,176398452,Alexander,"Хозяева бесконечно позитивные и добрые с прекрасным чувством юмора. Тая и Этьен помогали нам по всем вопросам, которые у нас возникали: подсказывали куда пойти, что поделать. Все советы были полезными и точными, например, ходили на 125 улицу за покупками (понравился магазин Marshalls) и в бар на Вест Вилладж. 
Расположение жилья очень хорошее, рядом с метро. Гарлем понравился. Недалеко до центра, много вкусных кафе рядом.
Комната небольшая, но очень уютная. Дополнительный бонус - кофеварка. Доступ на кухню и в уборную без каких либо ограничений, везде чисто, все удобно.
На кухне куча электроприборов и еще одна кофеварка, чайник.
Завтрак был включен в проживание."
17693,260109298,3/5/18,21148400,Jennifer,"Tye and Etienne’s is exactly what is advertised and more! It is a lovely, colorful, cheery, and warm home that will give you all of the good feels of Harlem! Both Tye and Etienne are very accommodating, effective communicators, calm, friendly, and sweet. There are these cookies and tea that they leave in the room that are TO DIE FOR! The bed is cozy, the house is clean...They accommodated my arrival (greeting me with wine and bottled water), and even allowed me to leave my bags while I rushed around the city running last minute errands to catch my flight. (Tye even made me a delicious farewell breakfast when I left!) The apartment is a stones throw away from public transit, and is on a nice block. I love how everyone knows everyone else, and call out to each other by name on the street-helping older ladies across. THIS is Harlem...if you want that experience...stay here with Tye and Etienne...you won’t regret it! I know every time I’m in town, I will certainly be trying to stay here! Thank you so much for a wonderful (Website hidden by Airbnb) only regret was that I couldn’t stay longer!!"
17693,265003943,15/5/18,178541452,Cregan,"Worked excellent for my stay. Had to be in Manhattan every day, C Subway on same block, 22 minute ride definitely  worth saving $150 a night on hotel, while getting the subway 'experience'! Tip- C train stops running late at night but A train will make the late night local stops including 155th. One night the stop was closed for construction and I had to walk from 145th at 2:30am but route was well lit and I felt safe. Pay attention to street signs though, Saint Nicholas Ave at some point splits off into two streets, the other being Saint Nicholas Place, which is little confusing.  If you are out late be smart and don't flash cell phone and wallet without paying attention to surroundings - just like any other big city. Best kep secret.. walk over the bridge to Yankee Stadium took 16 minutes and Hard Rock Cafe inside stadium has great happy hour on non-game days. Did not get a chance to meet Tye, but Etienne was extremely  cool, gave me a glass of wine upon arrival and cold water whenever I came back from a long day. Always asking if I needed anything. Building is old and full of character. This is not a hotel, it's just visiting your favorite relatives and crashing in their spare room to save a ton of cash while in NYC. If gate to living room is closed, 'Rocco' is in living room, so please let him be, he's an old rescue dog who needs his space. Even with the gate closed, you will have everything you need with your private bedroom, access to bathroom and kitchen fridge, and lightening fast internet. No hesitation about returning next time in NYC!"
17693,267368470,21/5/18,50950625,圆,"Etienne is a very kind and helpful host, who prepared for me breakfast with bagel, tea and fruits. The house seems a bit old, but it is not functional, very well-decorated and cozy. The closeness of this place to the subway stations is a pleasant surprise for me, since it only takes a one-minute walk to the 155st station, where the C train can arrive in midtown in around half an hour. I was unfortunately not able to meet Tye, but I had immensely enjoyed my stay. Would 100% recommend!"
17693,269022698,26/5/18,129698616,Meg,"‌Tye and Etienne has brought the definition of ""super host"" into another level! We moved to Tye and Etienne place after we had safety issue with our other previous booking that made us decide to move to new place. Etienne welcomed us warmly, providing our needs for our stay and even prepare us breakfast for the next day. He really take great care of us just like a caring friend does to you. We had no chance to meet Tye and only texting each other,  but she is always ask to make sure that we are happy and everything is allright with us. The place is clean and comfortable with unique artistic art. We had really good night sleep. 
‌The transport is very easy to go anywhere, even for us the ""very first time NYC visitor"". Train C is just 2 minutes walking from the building, train 1 just 5 minutes away. This is such a dream location. If we ever have chance comeback to NYC, we sure know where to go. Total recommended! Thank you so much Tye and Etienne, you guys made our holiday so sweet and unforgettable."

If you plan to visit New York!
They gave two bottle of great welcome wines for me. And the room was very clean and everything was perfect! Their place near to subway staion makes your trip perfect.
"
17693,318398066,3/9/18,172046993,Jasmine,"Tye and Etienne are the epitome of amazing hosts. From the moment I arrived, they made me feel completely welcome and loved. Their home is beyond gorgeous, and this certainly radiates through to the amenities that they provide. 

They went up and beyond to ensure that my time spent in New York was fruitful and meaningful. I’m itching to get back, and I will certainly make sure to stay at Tye and Etienne’s again!"
17747,28646,7/3/10,88380,Dane,"George and Lily are a terrific host and hostess.  They provided a warm and inviting atmosphere where we were made to feel right at home.  If travels allow, we know we will stay there again."

17747,247287,1/5/11,8670,Claire,"George and Lily were very nice and flexible for our late check-in. The room, bathroom and apartment are super clean, well decorated and very quiet. George gave us the best recommendations for breakfast in Fort Greene. If you don't know much about Brooklyn Food, he is the man to ask!
Overall a great place to stay for a weekend!"
17747,252870,6/5/11,551644,Hugh And Gwen,"Due to a little mishap in booking, we did not get to stay with George and Lilly, but George was very gracious in helping us find alternate lodging in his area of the city, which he did not have to do.  We look forward to staying at their place should the need arise in the future."
17747,290644,31/5/11,433812,Natascha,I stayed 2 and a half weeks with George and Lily and had an amazing time. The apartment is beautiful and the bed oh so comfy. Clinton Hill is a pretty part of brooklyn and the C train is on the same block which is super handy. George was extremely helpful with transport and directions for getting to certain places in manhattan - and recommending some top spots to eat and drink nearby - which were spot on! George and Lily made my stay in NYC a beautiful experience and I will most definately be calling on them again next time I'm in NYC. Thanks G&L for a top time! I miss you already!!! 
17747,317803,16/6/11,631667,Ruben,"Great accomodation and marvelous host.
All good!.
I will stay again with George on my next visit to Brooklyn."
17747,324777,20/6/11,624132,Kelly,George was a great host. He was very helpful and thoughtful. I enjoyed my stay in this room. I slept well - I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.  I particularly enjoyed exploring this neighbourhood. I just wished I had more time in this part of NYC.
17747,329193,22/6/11,527384,Stephanie,"George is an excellent host! The house is clean, the room is big and bright with plenty of shelf space, you get your own bathroom (a dream) and you're in a great neighbourhood with a subway stop at the corner. Highly recommended."
17747,352549,4/7/11,735765,Julie,We enjoyed the room and the location - very comfortable and convenient! Olea (restaurant) was a great recommendation from George. Would come back again.
17747,442713,13/8/11,334814,Vanessa,"The apartment is nice and in a good location.

However, the bedroom door didn't lock.  This might not be a thing for others, but I'm a woman traveling alone."
17747,508886,6/9/11,47349,Anna-Karin,"This apartment is a jewel, and George too! 
The area has lot's of cool restaurants and cafés - and don't miss the Brooklyn Flea at weekends!  "
17747,515784,9/9/11,936202,Sachiko,For me it was the first time I used airbnb. I really enjoyed staying in George's apartment. it's clean and nicely decorating. I like it.  
17747,547193,19/9/11,1117168,Jenny,"George hosted my parents on their latest trek to Brooklyn. While their real mission was to visit with their grandbaby a couple of neighborhoods to the south, George was a great ambassador for the nabe and offered suggestions for dining as well as a clean, quiet, and well-appointed place (including a private bathroom--a real selling point for my parents) for them to stay. The only drawback for us was the subway situation, because of work that weekend on both the C and G lines (out of anyone's control, obviously) and the notorious difficulty of getting between neighborhoods in the outer boroughs if you're not on the same line to Manhattan (ditto). For someone wanting to visit Manhattan and some of Brooklyn's trendier neighborhoods, though, the location would be perfect."
17747,552815,20/9/11,1023733,Erica,George was great. I felt comfortable at his place he is very helpful and knowledge about the city he made me feel right at home.  Thanks George!
17747,558160,22/9/11,924528,Michelle,It was my first timing using Air BNB and it was a wonderful experience. George and his family were wonderful host. The location was central to the train and to great dining. It was my first Brooklyn experience and will not be my last.
17747,566100,25/9/11,1104057,Torben,"I had three wonderful days at George place in Brooklyn. George is great host, arriving late was no problem. Thanks for the good recommendation for breakfast. Both Olea and also the bakery in Lafayette Ave where great and close by. 

It was my first time in NY, so my focus was on the tourist sights in Manhattan. Taking the C train (local train) it will take you about 30 min to get  to Time Square. But if you have time try to get out at High St and walk the Brooklyn Bridge.  

It did not manage to see MoMa and found out that Brooklyn also had many places which needs to be discovered. So I guess there will be a next time."
17747,586556,1/10/11,1131721,Scott And Lynne,George has a stylish apt in the heart of Brooklyn. Great views of Manhattan. George was a cordial and unobtrusive host who made us feel very welcome.  
17747,610472,9/10/11,729040,David,"The apartment is great and George is a perfect host--helpful but unassuming.  The apartment is lovely, clean and bright, with nice views.  Location is great, a block from the A/C trains to Manhattan.  There are excellent restaurants within a few blocks.  A well-stocked market, and a laundromat are within two blocks.  We intend to stay there again."
17747,619723,11/10/11,1107914,Frederick,"We stayed a couple nights and George is an excellent host!!  He was very chill and gave us recommendations for places to eat around the area.  He made us feel at home and the space was amazing - clean and comfortable in every way!  We loved the hardwood floors and the eclectic decorations. 

The location is superb and a few blocks to the train.  There are a few late-night spots a couple blocks away which can be fantastic after a night out..

Further, George made us tea and we had a great time chatting before we had to head out.  

Overall, I highly recommend Blue Trim Guest House and can't wait to go back!"
17747,630294,16/10/11,957342,Djiara,"My stay at The Blue Trim Guest House felt like Home. George is a gracious host who treats his guests like family. The space is gorgeous - bright, clean, modern, well-appointed - and the neighborhood will make you fall in love with Brooklyn and New York. "
17747,655506,23/10/11,1188869,Amélie,"George was a perfect host, nice and helpful. The appartment is exactly as described and though it is a bit far from Manhattan if you're using public transports, it feels like luxury to find such good accomodation in NYC."
17747,674898,30/10/11,957342,Djiara,"I'm a Blue Trim regular and fan club member. George is terrific and so is his space. You'll rest easy as his guest.

17747,699493,7/11/11,1265975,Armelle,"What a fabulous introduction to New York and first time AIRBnB’r!  Blue Trim Guest House is everything I could have hoped for; a super stylish apartment on the 6th floor with views across the city.  Comfy bed in a room with loads of natural light and space for my belongings, private bathroom, tidy, safe and secure.  Close to subway, shops, loads of restaurants, laundry.  George’s hospitality also exceeding expectations with info and generosity.   Highly recommend."
17747,718204,14/11/11,1346397,Alice,"Our stay @ Blue Trim Guest House was wonderful and there is not enough we can say. The location was perfect, the room cozy ,clean and very quiet and has private bathroom. George was simply amazing. He made us feel welcome and gave us all the advice to enjoy at the fullest the city.
We recommend this guest room for whoever wants to discover NYC in New York style."
17747,734862,21/11/11,113919,Adina,"George is warm, generous host with a home that reflects those qualities. When I overbooked my own place around the corner and needed a place for a close friend, George took care of him.  His apartment is stunning and tranquil, not to mention being in the best neighborhood on the planet.  I can't speak more highly of the competition! "
17747,746802,27/11/11,1350264,Anna,We had a wonderful time at Georges place. He's an inspiring and  magnificent host with lots of great recommendations. Thanks to him all our days began at a cosy little bakery (serving the worlds best oatmeal -try it!) and most of them ended at one of the neighbourhoods many small - but high quality - restaurants. In between it was very easy to reach the rest of NY City as the subway is only a block away. Therefore I can highly recommend George and his room to everyone searching for a place to stay in this nice area.   
17747,764497,5/12/11,1382526,Douglas,"This is a beautiful sunlit appartment with beautiful, sunlit occupants. We had a warm and comfortable stay here. George and Ben are delightful and the room was very pleasant. This is the best of many good Air BNB experiences."
17747,794976,19/12/11,980995,Susan,"Very accommodating host allowed reservation less than 24 hours in advance.  
Room was perfect with promised private bath.  
Never met until I was leaving; a perfect host situation since I am familiar with Brooklyn."
17747,802589,23/12/11,957342,Djiara,"At heart I identify as a Hawaiian-New Yorker.  Blue-Trim - the space,  it's people -  embodies the Aloha-Brooklyn Spirit.  You will love and feel loved here. "
17747,823220,2/1/12,1329171,Laura,"George's place was a very nice charming apartment.  It was very close to the subway line and therefore convenient to access.  
I would stay here again when visiting NYC."
17747,923454,15/2/12,106761,Dipak,"George's place is an oasis! It's peaceful, fun, joyful and he is a treasure! This is my second stay here, and if it wasn't for my purchasing my own place around the corner, I'd always stay with him. He's become a friend."
17747,931110,19/2/12,1570188,Jennifer,"My husband and I just returned from our visit to the Blue Trim Guest House - our first trip with our nearly 5 month old son and our first experience with Airbnb - and our stay could not have been better. We arrived midafternoon after a long day of travel, and George welcomed us warmly into his home. The space was bright and airy and had an incredibly calming vibe, providing a perfect respite from the pace of the city. Our room was cozy and quiet, with a comfortable bed and beautiful morning light. 

The location, too, was perfect for our needs. We arrived by Amtrak at Penn Station, and took the C train right to BTGH (the Clinton-Washington station is at the end of the block); as for other transit options, the Clinton-Washington G train is an easy 10 minute walk away, the B25 bus to DUMBO and the gorgeous Brooklyn Bridge/Fulton Ferry Park picks up just around the corner, and the Atlantic Avenue Terminal (with LIRR access, as well as several subway lines) was a pleasant 15 minute walk away.  

George was a wonderful host, and we really enjoyed chatting with him over a glass of wine in the evening and over our morning tea. We had a terrific experience at BTGH, and would happily stay there again on a future visit to NYC, or recommend it to friends."
17747,933582,20/2/12,1664579,Paul,"This is a great spot if you have business in Brooklyn or need to get into Manhattan because the A and C train are right outside the door.  But,  you don't have to go too far for a great coffee and french pastry around the corner.  George was a wonderful host, accomodations are veyr private and the views from his windows are great!  We'lll be going back again in the spring!"
17747,1009553,17/3/12,1890119,Olivier,"I spent a week at George's place, and it was a delight. Not only is his apartment spaceous, tidy and tastefully arranged, but George is a great human being, with a grasping, tolerant and colourful mind. And none the less a delicate sense of humour. I will definitely be back!"
17747,1024451,20/3/12,1825394,Alex,"What a warm and welcoming place to stay. This was my first airbnb experience and it exceeded all expectations. George is an engaging, helpful and mindful host and human being. I had an amazing four days getting to know Brooklyn, but Manhattan was easy to get to. Definitely book your stay at the BTGH!"

17747,1151133,19/4/12,1772669,Jesse,"Blue Trim is an ideal AirBnb experience: a beautiful, sun-filled apartment, a comfy bedroom, your own bathroom, and a very friendly, helpful host. The C line is very close by, and Clinton Hill / Fort Greene are great neighborhoods to explore. George was very accommodating and generous, and we recommend his recommendations - by that I mean, we found out about some great places because we took his advice. "
17747,1199499,30/4/12,1629220,Werner,"George ist ein angenehmer Gastgeber. Seine Wohnung ist sehr gut zu erreichen und gewährleistet einen angenehmen Aufenthalt.

The apartment is well located, it's big and its lovely!
The bed was a bit too soft, but I would say, this is a very personal impression and some like it like this!
I would totally recommend him as a host for NYC!!
It was my first trip and it was more than I expected!

Thank you George for V!

17747,1339668,24/5/12,1668036,Andrea,"Beautiful room in a safe area, close to the C-line. George is a very dedicated host, always eager to share wine, meals, advice and time. "

17747,1498251,17/6/12,2383010,Brian,"To the world community!
If ever you find yourself in Brooklyn and need an exceptionally clean, comfortable and convenient place to stay with a totally chill host who really knows all the great places to eat and enjoy, then look no further.
George is charming and pleasant and respectful of your privacy. He knows the area very well and always was spot on with the recommendations."
17747,1556968,25/6/12,2358682,Yvonne,"I can't recommend staying with George enough. New York can be discovered by various means - by staying at Blue Trim you will have easy access to subway stations which are within walking distance, so touring the city can be done with relative ease. The other way to discover New York is to spend time talking to a native. G. is a native with a creative spirit that is both kind and welcoming. The apartment itself is beautiful, in large part down to G.'s eye for the aesthetic. You will find yourself smiling when discovering gentle reminders of the host's humanity in the most unexpected of places. In addition, the apartment's view of New York's skyline is breathtaking. If you are the type of person who itches at the thought of spending time in a sterile hotel room then I highly recommend you spend your time at Blue Trim. George - thank you for everything.

17747,1614370,2/7/12,1371384,Oliver,"I don't think there's much I can add to the long list of glowing reviews already present. The apartment is perfectly located (minutes away from two subway stations), clean and quiet, and lovely decorated (had to keep my paws off the plethora of old cameras... sigh!).

Much more importantly though is the interaction with George. He took the time off to welcome me personally -- while hours away from a deadline. Tons of tips, an introduction to a terrific coffee shop.. in short, it never felt like staying at a BnB, but visiting a friend's place. Highly recommended."
17747,1901814,6/8/12,2746689,Narumi,"All were beautiful.
Also atmosphere of the room and a house, and green and rows of houses of the town.
Especially  I  was touched by the beauty of George's heart , and I thought that I was fortunate.
When I went back home I became rest, but when George was, warmth was able to be felt more.
Thank you for the great time.
I would like to have some wonderful moment in the house of George again.

Warm, inviting and full of light - it was a perfect space in the perfect location. Close to subways and a plethora of cafes/eateries I couldn't have asked for more in Brooklyn..
George is full of helpful hints and recommendations - a truly gracious host  who made me feel most welcome.
Staying at Blue Trim was a dream - a home away from home! "

It is a short 15 minute ride into Manhattan and the train stop is just down the street on the same block. I had an amazing stay and George & Emily were wonderful, gracious hosts. And both are terrific cooks! The experience was above and beyond what I expected, and I felt very much at home. We had meals, beers and wine together over the course of my stay, and each was an experience that I won't forget soon. If you get a chance to stay at their place, please don't hesitate! Thank you again George & Emily! Hope we see each other again soon! "

They're obviously experienced in hosting others, and the room was so nicely situated for staying for a longer period of time- dedicated space for clothing etc made us feel right at home. Fingers crossed that this room will be available again next time we are in town."
17747,180542917,10/8/17,132504443,Felix,First time using Airbnb and my experience with George and Emily was really great. Apartment was really clean and it's located in one of the best neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Subway C is only a block away.
17747,190514551,4/9/17,53685326,William,Loved the apartment closed to good food and and transportation
17747,195746296,20/9/17,401429,Molly,"George and Emily are beyond wonderful. They were excellent hosts: gave clear direction, made themselves available when we needed it, and gave us our space (not that we wanted any.. loved hanging out with them!). They're all-around fun, interesting, friendly, lovely humans. 

The apartment is clean, spacious, quiet, and nice to lounge around in. The room has AC, a fan, and a private bathroom right across the hall. It's a block away from the subway and very close to some really great food and bar options.

Thanks for everything, George and Emily! I hope we meet again. :)"
17747,197099194,24/9/17,45751019,Delos,"A great experience. George is a friendly, welcoming, and accompdating host, and the apartment is clean and comfortable. It’s also in the perfect location for exploring Brooklyn."
17747,200468633,5/10/17,149944514,Suzuro,とても快適に過ごすことができました。地下鉄の駅に近く、夜も人通りが多くて安全で便利な場所にあります。お部屋は清潔でインテリアも可愛らしく、ホストのGeorgeとEmilyはとても親切でした。また利用したいです。
17747,201638069,8/10/17,874727,Leah,"George’s apartment couldn’t be better located! He was a lovely host (we didn’t see too much of him because they left for the weekend), but he didn’t mind me working from their awesome dining room table, even when he was working from home too. He was totally accommodating and it’s a perfect set up for Airbnb."
17747,214285464,25/11/17,1273920,Tashi,"Had a great long-term stay with George and Emily. Recently moved to the city for a new job and couldn’t have asked for a better experience while getting settled in at work and finding a place of my own. George and Emily are great hosts and their home is clean, comfortable and conveniently located next to public transportation in a lovely area."
17747,217994498,10/12/17,16419580,Jeff,"George is a fantastic host and his apartment is a fabulous space.  The bedroom we rented was spacious with a very comfortable bed, and the shared spaces are well-appointed.  George was extremely quick to respond to all messages and questions, and accommodating in all aspects of our stay.  I highly recommend George's place for anyone looking for a quality Brooklyn experience!"
17747,249702489,2/4/18,10124338,Mike,"An absolutely wonderful place to stay in Brooklyn and you couldn’t ask for better hosts and a better spot. George & Emily are fantastic hosts who are easy to talk to, full of great recommendations, attentive, and respectful of their guests. Whether my wife & I needed to duck in and out for a quick stop or wanted to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee at the kitchen table, it feels like staying with good friends.

The space itself is clean, bright, quiet and the bed is super comfy. (I probably had my best night’s sleep in over a year during our stay.) The bathroom is located right across from the bedroom and the kitchen had everything we needed to prep a light breakfast before heading out for the day. They have an espresso machine but after George recommended the amazing Beny’s Delice bakery around the corner we would just walk there to grab coffee (and a croissant or three).

The location is great whether you are planning to just be in Brooklyn or travel into Manhattan. You can walk a block to the A/C train and be in Times Square in ~30 minutes (we were in town for a theatre show), or walk a couple blocks to the G train and hit up most of the Brooklyn neighborhoods. If you like to walk it’s the perfect spot for that too. We walked to both Prospect Park and Brooklyn Bridge Park from the apartment to enjoy some warm Spring weather.

Thank you Emily & George for a fabulous trip."
17747,252187139,9/4/18,181912308,Ryota,"It was perfect!
warm hospitality, very clean, great location, etc.

I recommend you George's house."
17747,253447402,14/4/18,14001677,Brian,"If you need a great location, clean space, and a gracious host look no further.  Very relaxing and comfortable environment.  

The windows do not face the street so the noise level is very low.  Easy to get around and George goes out of his way to make sure you have what you need."
17747,256749840,23/4/18,321718,Dave,"The room was very clean and comfortable, and very convenient to the bathroom.   George was very friendly and an excellent host, very quick to respond to any questions I had.  The location worked out very well for me.  I would definitely return."
17747,258686672,29/4/18,183959514,Tokay,"George was an amazing host! He made me feel right at home as soon as I arrived. The location was great and you’re able to get to Manhattan via train (on the same block) or you may walk to other parts of Brooklyn, if you’re up for the exercise. I felt safe at all times and even with only being there for a weekend, the locals greeted me the next day during my walk. Everyone in the area kind of makes you feel like you’re visiting extended family. 

The room was true to the pictures on Airbnb, the shower pressure was relaxing, the picturesque view from the common area is classic and the bed was super comfortable! I literally couldn’t have asked for a better spot for a weekend visit. I also had the pleasure of meeting Emily and she was the sweetest (she even recommended a couple of nail salons in the area after me simply stating I wanted to get mine done)! On my first night, we sat in the living room and talked like old friends. I admit, I wasn’t sure what to expect but now I can only hope George’s room is available for my next visit! 

Thank you George & Emily!"
17747,262676164,9/5/18,21137441,Mike,George was just gorgeous. He and his family were so wonderful and made our first trip to NYC to an amazing experience. Without his great recommendations we wouldn't have seen so many nice and cool places. We came as strangers but left as friends. Every time again. Thank you very much for everything.
17747,264996480,15/5/18,160506348,Mala,"I really enjoyed staying at George’s. He is so welcoming and warm as a host and made me feel right at home instantly.  As an added bonus the bed was so comfortable that I slept like a log which is unusual for me. Also, access to Manhattan is super easy with a train nearby. Highly recommended."
17747,266694400,20/5/18,26211134,Dominique,"George and Emily have a beautiful home in a fantastic location, but that’s just the beginning. They’re also excellent hosts. They took time to get to know us and made a point to hangout with us. We had a phenomenal time. I would highly recommend staying at their place. It’s clean, comfortable and welcoming."
17747,268619345,25/5/18,35553057,Michelle,George's home is amazing!! George and Em were super welcoming and it was a great neighborhood to stay in. They provided helpful suggestions of coffee shops and alternate routes to navigate Brooklyn. Em and George took time to bond with me and made my stay extremely pleasant. The pictures and description don't do justice to warm reception you'll receive staying at their home. I can't wait to stay again!!
17747,269514391,27/5/18,72018341,Raiven,"The only regret I have is that I didn't get a chance to meet George and his family when we stayed as they were out of town. Beautiful home, sparkling clean and full of style and ambiance. The neighborhood is nice, with a lot of eateries and stores in short walking distance. Perfect for our visit to Brooklyn!"
17747,293566117,20/7/18,29518825,Ksenia,"Amazing! I was so lucky to find this gem! George and Emily are great hosts, they made me feel at home from the moment I walked in. Apartment is spotless clean, the guest room is furnished with everything needed, there are plenty of clean towels and linen. Location is very convenient and close to subway station. 

I am definitely staying here again next time I’m in town. "
17747,296330319,25/7/18,203510088,Steven,Absolutely perfect! George’s attention to detail along with a very convenient location made my stay an absolute pleasure. 
17747,299722105,31/7/18,51062987,Ricardo,"Quedarse en lo de Emily y George fue una excelente experiencia! Los dos son muy amables, el dormitorio es muy cómodo, el departamento está a una cuadra del subte, bien equipado y tienen todo impecable. Definitivamente los recomiendo!!"
17747,302366253,5/8/18,33126071,Bartek,"George is very kind person. He gave me lot of tips regarding city. Place was very clear, room was gorgeous. "
17747,306335678,12/8/18,162394571,Nicole,George is genuinely a good person and you don’t find that very easy! Very happy with all he has done. Would definitely recommend! 
17747,315376861,28/8/18,101758930,Lance,George is a fantastic host. The space is thoughtfully curated and very clean. The room is well equipped. I had everything I needed and more. The location is perfect; right in the middle of Brooklyn. All this combined with a very reasonable price adds up to incredible value. I will definitely looks this place up again in the future. I couldn’t recommend it more highly.
18127,99024,17/9/10,207452,Marine,"The flat is in the PERFECT location, it is very neat and decorated with a lot of taste!
I would LOVE to stay there again to my next trip to NY!
Josh is the perfect host.
Thanks again
"
18127,153272,13/12/10,304623,Eric,"Had an excellent experience with Josh. He responded quickly to all my questions and the entire rental process went off without a hitch, including picking up keys from his neighbor when I arrived. And he found my eyeglasses that I left behind by accident and is sending them back to me.

The apartment is on a charming street in the middle of the East Village. It is spacious by NYC standards, with a comfy living room facing the street; a quiet bedroom in back. Kitchen and bathroom are small but functional and very clean.

So whether I was planning a day of shopping and eating or just kicking back with a book on a chilly afternoon, Josh's place was ideal. 

And the neighborhood is great. With the exception of my trip up to see a show on Broadway, I spent all of my time within a mile or so of the apartment - there are countless great restaurants and bars; fantastic shopping; and a short walk to the L-train, which will connect you to all the uptown subway lines.

So, yes, great time, great apartment, great host. Thanks, Josh!

"
18127,209244,26/3/11,402286,Aymerick,"Josh is an incredible host. Always available, we spent a very pleasant stay in his apartment. The district is very pleasant, with very nice restaurants. The apartment comes with of all the comfort. Everything was tied up and very clean upon our arrival. Josh gave us a warmly welcome. We felt like at home. It is undeniable that I shall return in this apartment for my next stay to New York.

Thank you Josh !"
18127,213810,31/3/11,424133,Stephen,"Josh was great and his apartment is very very nice. Beautiful location, great space, and great neighbours! Our first Air experience and one that means we shall definitely use it - and Josh's place when we are next in NYC - again."
18127,295655,3/6/11,528951,Florencia,"Our stay at Josh's apartment was absolutely perfect!!! The place is wonderful: charming, clean, spacious and warm. The neighborhood is lovely, great location! And Josh is a great host! He was so kind before arriving NY and also during our stay that we are totally thankful. We had a great time in Josh's apt and in New York as well, so we'd love to repeat the experience soon! Thank you Josh!!!"
18127,345572,1/7/11,564439,Mark,"I really can't rate Josh, or his charming little East Village Flat, highly enough. The flat is perfectly positioned in a great neighbourhood within easy walking distance of an array of amazing East Village sounds, sights and tastes. Comfortable and tastefully decorated, it was the perfect place to unwind after a long day (or night) of exploring New York City. 

Josh himself was a delightful host - helpful, friendly, and very welcoming.

All up I'd have to say my experience with Josh and my time in his apartment were pretty much perfect, and I really hope to be able to do it all again some time soon."
18127,501602,5/9/11,334021,Emily,"We had a wonderful time at Josh's apartment. He was an ideal host - friendly, accommodating and efficient. Although he was abroad during our visit, he made sure we were well looked after and called to check all was okay. The apartment is stylish and spacious, on an incredibly cool street in the East Village. We loved pretending we lived there! I have no hesitation at all in recommending Josh's apartment and can't wait for our next visit."
18127,532762,15/9/11,334021,Emily,"It was so lovely to be back at Josh’s – like an incredibly cool home-from-home. And we got to meet Josh this time as well, which was great. We had a wonderful, hassle-free holiday and have already recommended his place to friends!"
18127,603058,6/10/11,593739,Martin," The pictures you see accurately reflect the flat that you stay in. The place is tastefully put together, with all that you need at the ready. Would not be surprised to see myself there again in the future. "
18127,2286358,14/9/12,1903656,Warwick,"This apartment is exactly as it is described. It is large by New York standards and bigger than we expected. Very comfortable to spread out in  for a while. Good bathroom and very functional kitchen (though we never cooked) and very comfortable bed. It was hot while we we were there and the air conditioning kept it cool. It is 3rd floor and no elevator - common in NYC.Josh was very good to deal with and responded quickly. The location is excellent and quiet yet right near everything you might need and a 10 minute walk to the subway.
The condition of the apartment is immaculate and clean and because of this I guess Josh requires a larger than usual bond which is preferred through (Hidden by Airbnb) and which he refunds in 21 days if all is OK. That is a bit of an inconvenience because you end up out of pocket  for a month or so. I reckon it's a bit steep for the Air BNB community but nevertheless I highly recommend the apartment and would definitely stay again.
Personally I like East Village the most of the Manhattan boroughs. Neighbourly and clean and fresher air than the Upper sides. Walk to Soho, Greenwich, West Village, LES. Oh and get a bike from NY Velo on 2nd Av and ride across Williamsburg Bridge on a Saturday and see the Flea Market. Priceless on a nice day."
18127,2496960,3/10/12,3408536,Sally,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Josh's flat. It looks exactly like in the photos. The flat had clearly been professionally cleaned before we arrived and everything, including the bathroom, was spotless. We used his WiFi without any problems. 
Just so you know, there isn't a TV, but that didn't bother us at all.
The East Village location was perfect. Josh is friendly, helpful and super-organised.
If we come back to New York, we would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Josh!"
18127,2801192,4/11/12,2130919,Kinga,"Josh's Charming East Village Flat is exactly that; stylish, comfortable and very clean. It has a perfect location with subway just a few blocks away. Right around the corner you can find great restaurants, bakeries, and grocery stores. Josh is a very helpful and attentive host. I would certainly recommend his apartment to others."
18127,3053319,9/12/12,4273581,Karthik,"Josh was an excellent host during our stay in the East Village. He was the right combination of friendly and professional - both in his demeanor and in his communication. Very prompt and accommodating. My girlfriend and I are thoroughly happy that we picked his place for our first airbnb experience.

His apartment is all about the location. Heaps of places to check out in the neighborhood. The flat itself was thoroughly clean and setup to make fantastic use of the space available. It felt much larger to live in than I was expecting. It is an older place, so it does have its quirks, but that almost adds to the experience. I would not hesitate a second to stay there again when I make it over to NYC next."
18127,24877514,3/1/15,16642538,Marilou,"Great flat in a fantastic location. We immediately felt at home. If you are a coffee fan, the coffee shop in front of the building is just divine! Subway station and all the commodities really close by. The bed is comfortable. Josh is a great host. Although we didn't see him, communication was excellent. He always replied very promptly to all my questions. His neighbor who gave us the key is a charming lady. I would definitely go back there! Thank you Josh. "
18127,34223305,6/6/15,17892760,Ruth,Josh's place was in an awesome location. Close to restaurants & the subway. The apartment was clean & a great space for our two week stay in NYC. Josh was easily contactable during our stay. We would stay here again. 
18127,47674277,21/9/15,6262801,Andrea,"The apartment is indeed charming, well furnished and cozy. Josh was cooperative and extremely precise in his information guide making everything very easy to use. We particularly enjoyed the convenience of the location offering plenty of choice for food and entertainment.  "
18127,58379046,2/1/16,25167299,Shane,This place is brilliant. Gorgeous apartment exactly as shown in the photos. East Village is a trendy neighborhood to stay in and no sight is really too far away. Josh was excellent with his communication. Will definitely stay again! 
18127,297318289,27/7/18,1005373,Suzanne,"Josh and his place are great!  The apartment is in the heart of the East Village, yet quiet and very comfortable.  Josh is a very professional, friendly, and accommodating host.  We appreciated his easy-going kindness, we felt very relaxed and happy in his lovely place.  I especially enjoyed his design style and mix of antiques and modern pieces.  Everything was as or better than expected-we enjoyed Josh’s place so much we have already booked it again for our next visit!"
18195,26514,16/2/10,70149,Faye,"Our experience was very positive and uncomplicated:

Justin and roommate Josh (Ildiko was abroad) are helpful and friendly and take their role as hosts seriously. The apartment is located close enough to the subway AND the Long Island rail road (and to LGA), the Woodside neighborhood offers ample ethnic food options. Located on a quiet street, the apt is modern and clean and comfy. Priced very reasonable. Definitely worth considering when visiting the NYC area."
18195,36308,18/4/10,87551,Stephen,"Justin & Ildiko are awesome hosts and completed our trip. They're very knowledgeable about the whereabouts to go locally and made some great suggestions about good eats, transportations and local scenic places. The room itself was neat and comfortable, the place very convenient as I had to travel throughout the 5 boroughs. We thoroughly enjoy our stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again, anytime. We wish to cook something for them someday :D Recommend, recommended."
18195,64508,14/7/10,86403,Nathan,A definite 5-star review! Justin and Ildiko are perfect hosts and the room I took - King of Queens - was great. The flat and area are quiet and tidy. I felt very much at home and would surely stay with them again and recommend them to anybody. Justin and Ildiko - thank you!
18195,96699,14/9/10,151594,Carolina,"Justin and Ildiko were really great hosts!!! They are very nice, warm and friendly. Their apt is spacious, really nice (Justin did a great job with the new bathroom!) and well located. The neighborhood is also quiet and safe. Highly reccommended if you are planning to visit NY"
18195,126709,25/10/10,247408,Tilde,"Justin & Ildiko are realy wonderful. 
They give you every freedom you need and every information you ask for. 
If you need them, they help you.
If you want to experience NYC on your one, they let you.
Their appartment is beautiful and well-located. 
You experience NYC like you are living there. 
The subway is just around the block and it feels like less than 15 minutes before you're in the centre of NYC. (I think it is about 20 minutes max.)
Thank you so much, you guys. 
Tilde"
18195,488598,30/8/11,953900,Alexandra,"Justin & Ildiko are fantastic hosts, very friendly and always happy to give advice on stuff to do. The room is totally beautiful, in fact their whole apartment is. The private ensuite bathroom is lush and their kitchen is gorgeous. The location is great too, very close to Times Sq on the subway. I would definitely recommend this place and would definitely book again."
18195,573232,27/9/11,745524,Britta,"This booking was my first experience with airbnb - and was the perfect choice! The apartment is very tasteful furnished, my own room was very big and quiet. It had its own bathroom with a shower, so you have a lot of privacy. I loved to come ""home"" after a busy day and to cook something in the wonderful kitchen with all utensils needed. I could use the WiFi and the public laundry room downstairs. The room is airconditioned and has a ventilator. Justin and Ildiko were very busy but always took their time to answer all my questions and give me helpful recommendations. The apartment is nearby to two subway-stations of the line 7 (during the rush-hour you can use the express) and the LIRR. There are nice little shops for essential goods, a library, bars and restaurants in the proximity - especially the sushi-restaurant I will really miss. In the apartment of Justin and Ildiko you really feel like ""King of Queens""!"
18195,1540194,23/6/12,52030,Jeanne,Excellent place to stay if you are planning a trip to NYC!  The room was very clean and comfortable (the air conditioning helped with it being 100 degrees for two days we were there).  We never actually saw Justin and Ildiko but they were available by phone/email/text . The entire apartment was beautiful and very convenient to get around to NYC.
18195,3936207,29/3/13,4685177,Miriam,"Another definite 5-star review! The room I took (King of Queens with Private Bathroom) was just great! It is quiet, comfortable and I loved the windows in the corner and the sunny mornings. The private bathroom is  luxury and the whole apartment is well designed. The kitchen is just as perfect as it is shown on the pictures. But the most important fact is, that Justin and Josh are great hosts. Justin and Ildiko were abroad during my stay but they answered every question immediately and gave helpful hints whenever needed.  Josh, his flatmate, is easy-going, humorous and just as said before –  in this apartment everyone can profit of his or her own space but at the same time find company if wanted. Thank you so much! I do not have to add anything to the previous reviews about public transport and the area...Highly recommend. "
18195,7574687,25/9/13,6009122,Roman,"This was my and my partner's first visit to NY and first airbnb experience. Overall I am really pleased with the bouth :) My review:
Booking: we booked the place several months before the visit. The official host Justin was there for any question i had (and there was a lot). He provided us with all the details.
Apt: The room is really big. There are 2 windows on the rear but sunny side. The bath is renovated (the room is not) and it is very nice. There is a closet in the room, that we did not use. The appartment was clean. 
Building: It's pretty old. And one could feel it. But I think it is kept well. The walls are thin, some times you hear some noise from the neighbors. However, in the evening it's very quite. We are really sensitive to any noise, but we had a great sleep.
Neighborhood: This part of Queens populated mostly by immigrants. It's safe and quite. One can get the idea of the real city, not the turistic one. That exactly that we were looking for. The place has good connection to midtown by subway (lines 7 and R) and LIRR. The last is the fastest way to get to midtown but more expensive.
Host: We did not meet Justin & Ildiko, because they were abroad. Our host was Josh. He is a great guy. He is very friendly and  kind. Always tried to help us and to answer our questions. He is very quite person as well.
Overall: We had great time. Recomended

18195,76018687,24/5/16,72354659,Turgut,"Justin was a wonderful host. His apartment is spotless and it felt just like home. The private bathroom makes the stay very hassle free. There are many restaurants and bars in the neighborhood and the 7 train makes travel very easy. We were able to stay a week in NYC without the need for an uber, taxi, etc. It is very easy to travel to LGA from the apartment as well. 
"
18195,87500306,20/7/16,9260259,Timothy,Justin has beautiful space in a very quiet building.  Only 2 blocks from the train (but not a hint of the noise) so very easy to get into the city.  Not far from I278 and street parking was reasonably easy to fine.  Hope to stay our next time through NYC.
18195,227656210,15/1/18,72364125,Jocelyn,"Justins place is great, the area is very nice and it is just a few blocks away from cool bars and restaurants. The complex has a laundry room which was super convenient for us, and there are grocery stores very near. The place is quiet and perfect to relax after a day in the city. The room is exactly as advertised and the bed super comfortable. Big common areas and very clean. One of the best Airbnb experiences we have ever had. Justin is the best Airbnb host you can find, he is so friendly and welcoming. And he made sure that we felt at home the whole time. We can’t wait to be back and visit his lovely apartment again."
18195,259189113,30/4/18,40371032,Jinee,Justin’s hospitality was great!

18195,302523257,5/8/18,128428407,Dylan,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Justin's apartment this summer. Justin is an enthusiastic host and really cares about his guests. The room was large and everything is exactly as described in the posting. The bathroom was very spacious and clean. Further, Justin gave us full access to the kitchen which we used daily. The area is very safe and close to multiple subway stops. The apartment worked out extremely well for us and we would recommend staying here to anyone. Ask Justin about the local spots when you visit! "
18198,27710,27/2/10,68497,Precious," I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Justin & Ildiko's apartment. The room gorgeous apartment was nicely decorated and the room I stayed in was large and clean and the bathroom was beautiful! The kitchen is awesome and has a nice view of the park across the street. The other roommates are friendly and Justin was extremely kind and helpful when I arrived and consistently checked everything was going ok. The area is fantastic because of its proximity to Manhattan and it has everything you need; grocery store, restaurants, Banks and a drug store. It is a safe residential area and the other people in the building are very nice. I would definitely consider staying here again, if the opportunity arose.  It was really a pleasure.  Thanks!!"

18198,40566,7/5/10,98426,Martina,"Thanks, Justin and Ildiko! Your place made my stay in NYC really good! I had a very nice room and was so happy about the bath room. I loved the view onto the park and listening to school kid's voices in the morning. I felt always secure, and there are many facilities to buy staff for the daily needs. You also can find several bars/cafes to go out for a nice dinner. A really good thing is to come home from the busy city and can ralax at the very cozy pleace. I arrived via JFK, and so the appartment was perfect to stay - you have a great connection via LIRR. Conclusion: highly recommended - also for alone travelling women.
Thanks, Martina"
18198,58730,28/6/10,145278,Kalle,"Jusitn and Ildiko were absolutely fantastic, friendly hosts.  The room and apartment were perfect (had a chic boutique hotel feel to it).  The location was ideal and convenient. The price was right.  I would highly recommend staying here during your visit to New York!"
18198,62044,7/7/10,134786,Jennifer,"Justin & Ildiko were excellent hosts. I'd never stayed with hosts before except for in more formalized, inn-like, B&B set ups and I was a little bit nervous socially. Justin was at the apartment to greet me and I immediately felt at ease, we were chatting like old friends in minutes. 

The apartment is spacious for New York with ample common space and a nice kitchen. I stayed in the ""little king of queens"" with clean, separate, bath and was very comfortable. 

The location in Woodside is very convenient for the seasoned NYC traveler or the budget tourist, just one stop from the JFK airtrain on the LIRR and right on the express 7 line to Grand Central & Times Square. The neighborhood itself features a good wine shop, several decent ethnic grocers, and the best Thai food I have had outside of Thailand. 

I don't see any reason to ever stay anywhere else in NYC again. 
"
18198,102279,21/9/10,225656,Ramona,"to make it short: it was the perfect choice for new york!

.5min. walk to train/subway station & grocery stores.
.proximity to city (20min. to grand central).
.ildiko & justin are great and easy going people.
.very clean and tidy (Website hidden by Airbnb) just felt like coming home at night.

should we come back to new york we would definitely like to stay at little king of queens again. 

"
18198,166115,5/1/11,290416,Luca,"Justin&Ildiko are the perfect host. We arrived at very unconvenient time at night (1.30 am) and they both were waiting for us awake. Useful for any infos required abt directions.
Location of the house is in a quiet street, 4 blocks far from the train number 7 which in 20min time is taking you in Times Square!
Overall i would highly recommend to try the Little Queen of Queens!"
18198,177793,3/2/11,34213,Andy,"This apartment is GORGEOUS and Justin and Ildiko are very gracious and generous hosts.  I really enjoyed my stay here, it suited me very well.

The apartment is located in a lovely quiet area and opposite a park which luckily for me, was snow covered during my whole stay, it was so pretty. Having my own bathroom was a great selling point for me, which for this price range, is not that common in New York!  

The apartment is close to the subway, the city, the airport and you have everything close to hand when required.  I have no negative feedback at all and highly recommend this room.  Thanks so much for your hospitality and I would love to come back again!"
18198,238113,24/4/11,504211,Owen,"My stay at the Little King of Queens couldn't have been better.  Justin and Ildiko were very gracious and respectful hosts, and their apartment is perfect.  
The room overlooks a park in a nice area of Queens.  Even when I came back to the apartment late at night, I felt very safe walking around the neighborhood.  
They have recently redone the kitchen and bathroom, and all the appliances are top notch.  Great water pressure and a shower head that any traveler can appreciate after a long day.  
One of the biggest perks of this place is that it's the last stop on the LIRR to Manhattan.  Walk six short blocks to the station and catch a train that goes straight to Penn Station in ten minutes!  I've been staying in Williamsburg, Bay Ridge, and other parts of west Brooklyn before this, but it took anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and a half to reach Manhattan by the Subway (especially late at night).
Thanks again Justin and Ildiko for a pleasant stay!"
18198,246481,1/5/11,412051,Jared,"Great, friendly couple. Very helpful if you're new to the city. Lovely room with fantastic shower."
18198,262834,14/5/11,479501,Kathleen,"First experience with Airbnb and my sister and me are so happy about it! We don't have regrets at all about the place we chose. Justin and Ildiko are great!! They take it easy, they fun and so you feel immediately like at home! The place is amazing! Great apartment, great room and the bathroom!! We loveed it! It was new and clean!!! Everything was perfect! I even don't find the words to explain, it was just perfect, just what we expected for a first Airbnb experience. And for the location, that's the best! 5 minutes walking to go grocery and 5 minutes walking to go to the subway/LIRR train, the number 7 goes straight downtown (Grand Central or Time square). We loved spent time with justin&Ildiko in this place and if we had to go back in NYC one day, for sure, it will be in this place!"
18198,349328,3/7/11,369934,Dennis,"Ildiko & Justin got a spacious and lovely apartment. The room was very nice and clean, just as the private bathroom with shower and bathtub was. Shared rooms like parlor and dining room were tidy and cozy. The renovated kitchen with its huge fridge and all imaginable utensils was amazing! Rooms were air-conditioned. The two of them were very kind and helpful and always contactable concerning questions and advice. There wasn't anything to complain about during our stay... Even the apartment's vicinity in Queens was pleasant and vibrant, Manhattan / Time Square could be reached by subway within 20 minutes +5 minutes walking to the station."
18198,404970,29/7/11,835247,Fanny,"My boyfriend and I had an awesome time in NY - espacially because of Justin and Ildiko, they are wonderful person! They gave us plenty of tips of where to go and what to do! We really appreciated their help! Would definitly stay with them again next time we go to NY! Their appartment is amazing, the location is great - couldn't be better! It really felt like home in a city that we didn't know!"
18198,670196,28/10/11,776863,Jochen,Ildiko & Justin waren perfekte Gastgeber. Die Verbindung nach Midtown und auch zum JFK Airport ist sehr gut. Wir würden auf jeden Fall wieder kommen. 
18198,1092323,7/4/12,1343161,Walter,"We had an 8 night's great stay in Justin&Ildiko apartment! It is really closed to the subway which takes you directly to Times Square in 15-20 minutes and it's easy to reach from the JFK Airport.
Justin & Ildiko were very helpful with all our questions, and had great suggestions for us.
The room and the bathroom for the guests were clean and the bed very comfortable.
So..we recommend this solution as a great alternative to Manhattan's rooms!

Walter & Vale"
18198,1270162,13/5/12,80840,Petra,"Justin and Ildiko are simply fantastic! Their apartment is spotlessly clean, with a very well equipped kitchen with everything you could need. Everything is tasteful and well designed. The room is cosy quiet and comfortable (and over looks a park as well) and the private bathroom is modern and clean.  The area is great - safe and close to Manhattan. Great transport links with two subways lines (7 and M) close by, the long island railroad and lots of buses. Amazing food options - I've never eaten so well (and far better and cheaper than Manhattan!). And as for the hosts, well, they're fabulous. They're not around much and they have their own living room so you have your own space but at the same time they bend over backwards to be helpful and they're great company if you do want to chat. I couldn't recommend this place more highly!! "
18198,2080021,24/8/12,2526047,Mischu,"I spent a wonderful time in the apartment of Justin and Ildiko. They both are very kind people, generous and trustful. For me the best adress to stay in New York. The apartement is clean, cozy and having own bathroom is splendid. And also has a very good location.
When I'll come back to NY I will always go to them, my best recommendation.
"
18198,2388331,24/9/12,1582373,Carlos Roberto,"I had a great time staying on Queens really close to the city, near the apartament you can find everything youll need restaurants a nice little park and a few block away on queens boulevard there are available a bunch of stores , if youre staying here take the 7 train to manhattan it will take you directly to grand central station or to times square station. Great place to stay. Really happy with the overall experience. Justin and ildiko are just great Hosts they make me feel just like at home. This is the place to stay ! The bathroom its private and just really really nice and the all apartament its just beatiful. "
18198,2640115,17/10/12,3217888,Cindy,"Justin & Ildiko's place is really clean and tidy, not single speck of dust can be found!  It takes around 10 minutes to walk to the nearest subway station (Woodside). From Woodside to Time Squares, it takes around 15-20 minutes, which is considered fast.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay there as Justin is a friendly and understanding host. Thanks Justin & Ildiko ! :)"
18198,3075482,11/12/12,66692,Bruce,"We had an EXCELLENT visit. From beginning to end, Justin, Ildiko & Josh provided GREAT communication, that was timely and always courteous.

18198,40721848,2/8/15,25367366,Sheila,I immediately felt welcome at Justin's place. The neighborhood was great. There is a park directly across the street which you can cross to get to more streets with grocery stores and restaurants. It is about an 8 minute walk to the 7 stop and the Long Island Railroad. The 7 train takes about 15-25 minutes to get to Grand Central depending on if you take the express train. I never felt unsafe walking from the apartment to the train! I will definitely rent here again. It was my first time in New York and I am so so so grateful for having a place that was clean and roommates who I could hang out with at home or meet out somewhere. I highly recommend staying here with Justin and Joern!!!

The neighborhood was safe, quiet and close to train stations. Not to mention that there are tons of grocery stores, restaurants and all other kinds of stores around. Justin was always there to help me out and provide whatever I needed. I am very very glad that I choose to stay here and I appreciate everything that Justin did."
18590,38848,30/4/10,87009,Audrey,Blaise has a gorgeous home and on top of that he is a friendly and gracious host.  I stayed for 6 weeks while relocating back to NY and I really enjoyed my whole stay.

His place is conveniently located in Brooklyn; with easy access to the subway.  We were able to relax comfortably in his beautiful home.  He is extremely friendly and kind.  We even forgot a blanket and he was kind enough to send it home to us!

Blaise is very cordial and provides guests with the upmost privacy as well as comforts so one feels like they are staying in their own home. It was my first airbnb experience and because of it I plan to make more frequent use of this service!"
18590,205942,21/3/11,426368,Tam,"Blaise is a thoughtful, gracious host and his home was beautiful and comfortable. Our bedroom and bathroom were clean and tastefully decorated.

18590,278328,24/5/11,434850,Anne,"My husband and I had a most enjoyable five day stay at the 4th floor brownstone townhouse of Blaise Backer. As a host, Blaise was welcoming, supportive and most respectful of our space. His home is beautifully and comfortably decorated. The kitchen area is well organized and we were able to store a few perishables  in his refrigerator and use the microwave and ""hot water tap"" to fix simple breakfasts before setting out for the day. Blaise indicated that we could use his kitchen to prepare larger meals if we desired.
One of the best features of Blaise's home is a roof top garden area off of his upstair's study. Herbs and vegetables surround the space and it is a wonderful place to have breakfast or read. 
The location of Blaise's home is ideal. It is located on a quiet street across from Fort Greene Park. And it is within walking distance of some great restaurants.
We look forward to visiting his home again while visiting our family in Brooklyn."
18590,294082,2/6/11,357692,Linda,"I enjoyed my stay in Blaise's place very much. The flat looks just like the pics. The room is big enough with a huge closet and the whole place is very clean and cosy. It is rather quiet and I slept very well. Blaise is an exellent host, who helped me with all information I needed both before my arrival as while I was staying. This was my first booking with airbnb, a very pleasant experience and the reason I will use it again."

18590,3506941,10/2/13,2926409,Janet,"Amazing place in Fort Greene right on the park. The bathroom was ridiculous (in a good way)--the best shower in Brooklyn! Futon was firm and comfy and the organized closet space was super handy. Just wish we could've utilized that rooftop deck but alas, the great blizzard of '13 prevented that from happening. It was so great to walk out the door and see everyone in Fort Greene sledding in the park. Many thanks to Blaise and Eric for being such lovely hosts."
18590,3635796,26/2/13,3910166,Kayne,"My mom stayed with Blaise and Eric while visiting us here in Fort Greene.  We've been looking for a place that is near our apartment as hotels are not within walking distance, and this ""b&b"" was perfect!  Blaise and Eric are wonderful hosts, and their apartment is absolutely beautiful.  It was a perfect spot for my mom, who was here primarily to spend time with our son (her first grandchild!).  She felt very comfortable with the apartment and the location, and I can't wait for her next visit so she can stay here again!"

Blaise was an accommodating host and made himself readily available to answer all of my questions about how to navigate the city. He was also respectful of my personal space, which made the experience of staying at his home comfortable and enjoyable. I would recommend staying at this home to anyone who wants to enjoy the charm of Brooklyn while being in close proximity to all that Manhattan has to offer."
18590,4266609,23/4/13,5079059,Franck,"Sorry to answer this late ! Our stay at Washington Park was simply perfect. Ideal location to feel the ""Brooklyn ambiance""... Just in front of the park, in the heart of a very quiet area (just 3 stations away from Manhattan frenzy !). The apartment is awesome, kinda loft duplex type, spacious and tastefully decorated by Blaise who was very kind and confident toward us. Discrete and quite busy host, we didn't talk so many times during our 8 days stay, actually, but we really felt at home. The comfortable futon allowed us to really recover from the exhausting walks in the city and, frankly, the roof deck is a true bonus (as well as the private & nice bathroom) ! Thanx again, Blaise. We recommend your place to other travelers..."

Nice location, close to many restaurants and bars,  and the Metro. we can go everywhere in Brooklyn and Manhattant from his place.  The apartment is very beautiful and very clean. The good things is to have your own bathroom! 
Blaise is a great host"
18590,13134574,20/5/14,6003981,Mathieu,"Superb apartment, probably the best kitchen and shower I've ever seen (the private bathroom is a plus). Great neighbourhood, right next to a park and very calm. Easy access to many subway lines. Blaise is a great host, easy going and helpful with suggestions. The bed is okay. Would go back anytime. Thanks Blaise!"
18590,14772967,26/6/14,13431753,Sofie,"Great location if you don't wanna be on Manhattan, but still close. Very pleasant and authentic neighbourhood. 
Very clean and cool apartment. Blaise is a friendly and relaxed host. 
The room itself is kinda standard, but there's what you need and you sleep very well there - and it's awesome having your own (and top-notch) bathroom.
Can definitely recommend this place!"
18590,16895570,4/8/14,14329685,Lukas,"Great apartment, and well located. 
We didn't feel very welcome. Strange communication with the host and in the end he left for the weekend and didn't say goodbye before. Wouldn't stay there again..."
18590,17682978,16/8/14,16594463,David (And Polly),"The apartment is in an excellent location, especially for our purposes being close to our son's home. An excellent location in general terms on a relatively quiet street (for Brooklyn), facing the park. Apartment is absolutely beautifully designed and decorated. Guest room is quite basic but on the back of the building so very quiet. Blaise offers full use of kitchen, etc. which we did not need. We will stay there again."

18590,19470132,13/9/14,1573159,Amélie,It was a beautiful flat in a really nice part of Brooklyn. There were A LOT of nice places to eat and drink around and having to walk only 5 or 10 minutes to find a nice dinner made us feel at home. The room is small but the bathroom is amazing - biggest tub ever. Getting to the subway is a bit of a walk but there's a cafe called The Hungry Ghost nearby - definitely recommended for delicious coffees and donuts from Dough. Blaise was a good and communicative host. 
18590,19928602,21/9/14,163606,Kimberly,"Blaise's home is truly a retreat and he was a wonderful host!  We came up to NYC for a Thursday wedding and Blaise was very flexible with our last minute schedule changes.  He met us at his apartment, explained everything and was more than willing to answer any questions we had along the way.  We felt completely comfortable in his home and very much enjoyed our stay.  The apartment is very clean and the most beautiful place I've seen yet in NYC! "
18590,20234138,26/9/14,3972224,Dean,"Fabulously appointed apartment, conveniently near transportation in very hip Brooklyn. Blaise was a perfect host and prepared the room (with its own bathroom) as if he were welcoming family. A comfortable and restful stay."

18590,21597073,20/10/14,7323141,Nan,"We just spent four days at the Fort Greene Retreat. For us , the location was perfect....near family we were visiting in Fort Greene. We also appreciated that it was an easy ten minute walk to a few different subways, across the street from the lovely Saturday Farmers' Market, near the Brooklyn Flea Market and the relaxing Pratt School of Design Sculpture Garden. There are a variety of restaurants in the neighborhood, which added to our enjoyment.  The apartment is as described---very clean and well  appointed.

Located close to the tubes and in a great neighbourhood in Brooklyn with loads of cafes, groceries close by and good access to Manhattan. Blaise was flexible with our check in time which we couldn't be more grateful for . His flat is comfortable and much bigger than the places we stayed in Manhattan which was great.

We enjoyed meeting him and being his guests. He was very generous with information that made the success of our trip possible - - answered our tons of questions, provided maps and even helped my husband with an app that enabled  us to  navigate our way through Manhattan and Brooklyn. 

This was our first stay in Brooklyn, (we’d stayed in Manhattan on previous visits), and we loved the quiet neighborhood feel of the location on the park. We found it convenient to public transportation that provided an easy rides into Manhattan, and we had no problem with street parking our car. 

 Blaise’s place was very clean and comfortable…and gorgeous besides. We used the kitchen quite a bit  - - found it modern, immaculate and well-equipped. Blaise made sure we had places to keep our own food and we felt right at home there. The bedroom was not large, but quite comfortable, and we slept well. There was plenty of storage room for our large quantity of stuff (we’d driven, and did NOT travel light!), and there were plenty of shelves. The bathroom was bright and clean with room for toiletries, and we had all the of fluffy towels we could want.

We would like to stay there with Blaise when we visit New York again!"

Chambre confortable avec placards, la salle de bains réservée est un vrai plus et le quartier est très calme (ideal apres une bonne journee de marche).
Blaise est très sympathique, c'est la première fois que nous tentions l'expérience ""chambre privée"" et nous n'avons pas été déçus."

The surrounding neighborhood is really special as well, including the best coffee shop my girlfriend and I have ever enjoyed. Blaise was a fantastic host. You won't regret staying here. (p.s. the coffee shop is Urban Vintage)"
18590,55791105,6/12/15,17057997,Shea,"The place was really nice and eclectic. We loved the high ceilings and the decor. The guest bathroom was great, but not attached to the room, which meant it wasn't exactly ""private"". However, it was clean and looked recently remodeled.  

The bedroom was as described with one window that let the morning light in.  Unfortunately the room simply lacked the character that the rest of the house had. The only other issue was that the room shared a common wall with the master, which also limited privacy. Overall it worked well and the price was right. The apartment fronted a park and was located right around the corner from a main street that had a bunch of good restaurants and shops. 

Blaise was accommodating with our schedule and helped us out where he could. "

His apartment is phenomenal - tons of space, a cool roof deck, comfy bed, wonderful modern bathroom, and incredible location.  Fort Greene is a great neighborhood to explore, and Blaise's place right on the park is the perfect home base to explore it from.

Thanks for a great stay, Blaise!"

Blaise and Ben have much better taste than me when it comes to interior design and the entire space is immaculate, sleek, and comfortable. We felt ""at home"" in the first thirty seconds.  From the flowered rooftop deck with the friendly feral cat, to the gourmet kitchen that would make even Martha Stewart happy to be out of the slammer, to the well appointed living space with Wi-Fi and HDTV ---- the whole place screams  ""I Love Brooklyn"" ----- and we did !!! Thanks for a great stay. We will be back -- hoping that a six star rating doesn't mess up the whole 'availability thing' !!!! "

Très spacieux, fonctionnel, le confort à l'américaine ! la chambre est plus simple mais largement suffisante pour son utilisation et la salle de bain privée (non attenante) est un vrai plus ! Quartier idéal pour se reposer après une journée de marche.  L'appart est très très calme. Le parc situé juste en face est très agréable, c'est le rendez vous des chiens (et de leur maître). Plusieurs épiceries à proximité, notamment Greene ville garden. 2 stations de métro pour accéder rapidement à Manhattan, et un petit 1/4 à pied pour rejoindre l'un des 2 ponts, Brooklyn et Manhattan Bridge avec une forte préférence pour le premier qui vous permet d'arriver face au City Hall et offre une vue splendide sur la ""skyline"". Bref, un sans faute, je recommande vivement les lieux !"

Réserver chez eux c'est accéder à un duplex très stylé, de part la décoration et de la disposition. Nous avons eu accès à toutes les parties de l'appartement (sauf leur chambre évidement) ce qui est un plus. La terrasse sur le toit et la salle de bain privée sont un vrai plus. La chambre est simple et suffit largement pour y être bien à deux personnes.

Le quartier est proche de toutes les commodités, un parc rempli d'écureuils, le métro, une station de citybike et beaucoup de shops de proximité sont accessibles à pied.

They made the whole house available, were generous with assistance and local knowledge but also allowed us space and privacy.  Having a private bathroom and access to the loft living space gave us a home-away-from-home feeling.  The location of their apartment is very convenient to shops and the subway and the neighbourhood was relaxed and friendly.  We also enjoyed our conversations with them about American lifestyle.

The private bedroom was quiet, and the private bathroom in the hallway was a great perk. Made breakfast in the large kitchen before departing every morning, and made dinner in a couple of nights. Great proximity to subway stations, local restaurants and within walking distance of Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan. Thank you for providing a great home base for a wonderful trip."
18590,128077312,22/1/17,92916668,Sanja,"This place is perfect - away from the hectic Manhattan, but very close to public transit and you only need to ride 2 stops to get to lower Manhattan (or you can even walk across Manhattan bridge and enjoy the skyline view). Close to grocery stores (which is great, because Blaise has a really nice big kitchen) and restaurants. I had work to do every day, so I appreciated the fast and reliable wi-fi. Bed is big enough for two and very cozy and you also get your own private bathroom, which is really nice. You get your own set of keys for the place, which is great, and rest assured they work - I wasn't sure I got the right keys when I first arrived back, because you have to force the key for outside doors a bit and I was afraid I was going to break the key, but once I got the hang of it it was easy. This place is perfect when you want to explore Manhattan and Brooklyn and feel at home. "

The place is really good located. The closest station is by 10 mins walk and you can go to the Lower Manhattan with the B train in 20 minutes. From the airport, we took an Uber and we paid around 40$. 

On Monday the house keeper came and she did not bother us at all. She was pretty nice! 

Ben and Blaise planed something when we booked the place and at the end, Ben stayed home to welcome us. Thank you again!!

The room has a big comfy bed and a lovely big window with lots of storage space, and the private bathroom is great. We were especially grateful for the nespresso coffee machine in the kitchen to aid our jetlag! The whole flat is beautifully furnished, and on the prettiest street we saw in Brooklyn, overlooking fort greene park. It is a short walk to lots of delicious brunch cafes and restaurants (Smooch and Olea were our favourite) , and not far to a choice of subway stops/lines. Thank you! We would certainly stay again and have already recommended the apartment to friends."

We are a couple in our thirties- we were visiting friends in NYC but wanted our own space in the city. A friend recommended their apartment - she stayed there a couple of years ago.

The apartment is very spacious and clean - perfect for heading out to Manhattan or Williamsburg or Brooklyn Heights / Dumbo and the southern hoods of Brooklyn - it's in a good location to hop on various public transport lines.
There are some good Restaurants and Breakfast places nearby. The neighborhood is safe, but it is NYC so just be smart. We as a couple for example did not walk through fort Greene park late at night.

We had our own private room with enough space for our suitcases, clean comfy sheets and a window you can even open, even though the whole place has central air conditioning. 
Additionally we had our own private bathroom: super clean, soft towels, big rainshower. 
The whole place is a duplex and super spacious - they put some much effort furnishing it with care and thought.

We were mostly out and about town visiting people, but it was super relaxing to know that we have that room / apt as our base there. 

Blaise and Ben were very friendly, calm and the communication beforehand und during our stay was quick, helpful and relaxed. There was no drama at all. 
They were out for work in the mornings when we woke up and came back before we came back late at night. 
We tried to be quite and hope they enjoyed having us as their guests! We will recommend their place!"

Me and my wife spent here a period of vacation and we found Blaise and Ben two great hosts. Brooklyn offers you lots of cool spots, restaurants and bars. Less than ten minutes walking from subway stations to get downtown."
18590,214755123,26/11/17,152217714,Gaizka,All was perfect in our stay in Blaise’s place. The house is gorgeous and very clean too. Both Blaise and Ben have been at all time helpful and friendly.

18590,231493256,1/2/18,72990552,Kasper,"Blaise and Ben were both very friendly. Also, they provided clear answers and great suggestions whenever I had a question. The aparment is huge and nicely furnished. It’s a big plus that there’s a separate bathroom for guests only. I enjoyed the neighbourhood as well, and there are a lot of great restaurants nearby. Could not have wished for a better place to stay!"
18590,247161389,27/3/18,20448301,Raquel,"Comfortable, quiet, clean, and beautiful place right next to Fort Greene Park. Amazing kitchen and comfortable living room to hangout. We loved this place and the hosts are super nice and accomodating."
18590,252450778,10/4/18,115114612,Roger,Fabulous location very handy to all things Brooklyn.  If you want to get a taste of living US style in a cool suburban location this is it.
18590,255463657,20/4/18,28569635,Don & Ming,The place is close to metro stop. Very nice view of the city and park. I would definitely book this place again.
18590,260688498,4/5/18,26686530,Rüdiger,"Tolle Wohnung in guter Lage in Brooklyn, Besonderheit: Dachterrasse, Klimaanlage, sehr schöne Renovierung. Spannende Gegend, gute Restaurants, in 10 Minuten zu public transport, mehrere Linien, kurze Distanz nach Manhattan."
18590,264308315,13/5/18,2415586,Sue,"This is a really exceptional apartment.  The location is lovely - in the heart of Fort Greene, and overlooking the park.  Everything in the apartment is to a very high standard, and the roof terrace is a great bonus.  The room is very attractive and comfortable, with a good bed, a good blackout blind (important for jet-lagged European visitors) and the bathroom has an excellent shower.  A state-of-the-art air con system makes the apartment very comfortable in hot weather.   Blaise and Ben were very pleasant and friendly, and I also had the added bonus of having the apartment to myself over the weekend."
18590,266231293,19/5/18,184269152,Caro,"Blaise's apartment is stylish and includes everything you could need. It's in a great location opposite Fort Greene part and close to excellent restaurants and to the subway. Our room was lovely and it was great having sole us of a bathroom. Blaise and Ben were always helpful, ready with information and generous with their home."
18590,269630289,27/5/18,9865516,Hortense,Nous avons passé un excellent séjour dans l'appartement de Blaise et Ben qui sont des hôtes très accueillants. Très bonne communication avec Blaise avant l'arrivée. L'appartement est conforme à la présentation. La chambre est propre et fonctionnelle. La salle de bain privative est un vrai plus. Nous avons pu utiliser la cuisine pour le petit déjeuner et le dîner le soir en rentrant. L'immeuble est très calme. Plusieurs stations de métro à 10 mn de marche permettent de relier Manhattan rapidement. Brooklyn est à découvrir. On apprécie son calme après une journée de visite à Manhattan. Merci Blaise et Ben pour votre accueil.
18590,304446948,9/8/18,3272764,Michael,"This apartment is stupendous, a beautiful brownstone overlooking a park in a great part of Brooklyn. The interior is stunningly decorated and furnished. Absolute joy to spend time there and 5-10 minutes from subways taking you all over NYC. Can not recommend highly enough!"
18590,308547402,16/8/18,4418722,Anna-Sophie,The apartment is very well located and faces a nice park in Brooklyn. The apartment is very well furnished and was entirely clean. Both hosts were very welcoming. 
18728,198686,14/3/11,403040,Dorian,"Rick was a most pleasant and accommodating host.  He really made us feel welcomed and at home in this spacious two floor apartment. You can tell right off the bat that great attention to detail and care was taken to make our stay very comfortable.  Unfortunately, we did not  get the opportunity to meet Dave since he was on tour.  

The apartment itself offers ample space and sufficient privacy, so you really feel at home and relaxed at all times. The space was just like in the pictures - spacious, clean, and modern with an unbeatable location.

Overall, the experience of staying at Rick & Dave’s was better than expected. I highly recommend staying there for anyone who’s looking for a taste of one of New York’s most vibrant neighborhoods, all the while staying in comfortable accommodations.    

Thanks Rick!
"
18728,230450,18/4/11,474404,Karsten,"TOP!
David is a very nice and helpful host
The place is absolutley great. 
It is a two floor apartment. Guestroom is (Website hidden by Airbnb) you have your privacy....also your private bathroom.
For me: One of the places to stay in New York"
18728,242723,27/4/11,492243,Jim & Cheryl,"David & Rick were welcoming, helpful, professional and accommodating. The location was ideal in many respects - convenient to venues, public transportation, stores and eateries. The loft itself surpasses how great it looks in the photos. It was inviting, clean, secure and had 1st class amenities. It was a pleasure meeting David & Rick and staying at their incredible loft."
18728,248487,2/5/11,416410,Romain,"It was a real pleasure to stay at Dave & Rick apartment. 
It's very well located and proper - it have a full privacy and have a large space. We have really felt they had the huge sense of hospitality.
The district itselfs is very nice. 

I strongly recommend not only the apartment itselfs but speding few days and time with Dave & Rick who are really nice guys."
18728,304216,8/6/11,135402,Russ,"I was coming to NYC for a few days for a conference and decided to add a few extra days to the stay. Typically, I stay in a place where I have the entire place to myself. However, the combination of location (just off the Meatpacking district) and the apartment itself which is pretty spectacular won me over quickly. Beautiful place in a great location hosted by some very friendly people. A really great place to stay. I had an entire floor to myself that itself was twice the size of most manhattan apts and three times the size of most studios/1 bdrooms."
18728,322460,19/6/11,632768,Mary,"I can't imagine how much more wonderful hosts could be than David & Rick.  Thoughtful, accommodating welcoming, helpful, and just plain really cool & nice!  Their beautiful home is comfy and warm.  I feel like I have new friends in The CIty.   Thanks Guys!  MmmmWA!"
18728,330399,23/6/11,654155,Greg,"It's a beautiful place in a great location adjacent to the West Village, close to Chelsea and to one of my favorite places in Manhattan - the Rubin Museum. 

Guests stay downstairs in what is effectively a separate apartment. A stairway leads down to a mysterious hallway (think Jean Cocteau) at the end of which one can glimpse the shimmer of light on the GORGEOUS Petrov grand piano. The decor is a mix of contemporary with middle eastern/islamic furniture found in the bazaars and souks of Cairo. A skylight provides soft illumination during the day and this must be one of the quietist spaces in all of Gotham. You will soon find yourself happily ensconced and secure as an emir in this lavish redoubt! "
18728,342104,29/6/11,541978,Jamie,"David & Rick's apartment is stunning and in a really great location. They were excellent hosts and by the end of the stay felt much more like friends. They showed me around, invited me to parties and got me on the guest list to a few special events. I can also imagine that they would be equally comfortable to leave other guests to themselves if they were not feeling as sociable as i was.
If you have any doubts about the room layout, as it is a bit hard to understand from the description and photos; you get a whole floor to yourself, with a bathroom. This is great and pretty private. The sofa bed is not as comfortable as a real bed, but I found it more than enough and fine for anyone but the most fussy guest. If there are more than 2 of you, the couch can be made up to be a good sleeping additional place."
18728,416392,2/8/11,807369,Jacob,David and Rick were great hosts. Very friendly and welcoming and were happy to give tips on where to go in the city. The room is also very nice and comfortable and the location is very convenient. Highly recommended if visiting NY. 
18728,425816,7/8/11,640618,Eric,"David,+ Rick were wonderful hosts. easygoing, flexible, and very helpful w/ suggestions when needed. would stay again w/o question. the location of their accommodation was a plus as well. this was my first use of airbnb,+ the experience will have me booking through them again..."
18728,535575,16/9/11,701686,Raffael,"David & Rick's Place was just amazing - as David & Rick are themself. Very centraly located, the appartment is def.more than just a ""room"". You have a whole floor just for yourself, everything is clean and looks more than nice.

David & Rick are the best hosts you can imagine. As David was at home most of the time we where there (but upstairs, never ever bothering you!), he helped us with every question, gave us tips and told us where to go to.

If you're looking for a cool, centraly located, clean & even stylish place with more than just friendly hosts - contact them.

Raffael & Lukas "
18728,556639,22/9/11,943038,Josh,"David and Rick are both friendly gracious hosts.  Their home is comfortable, spacious and beautifully furnished; its also spotlessly clean.  Its in a great location close to the the subway (ACE & L) and restaurants and a short walk to Union Square.  The guest quarters are secluded downstairs with a large sitting area, a sleeping are and a bathroom.  I travel to NYC frequently for work, and this is a far better value than you will ever find for any comparable hotel."
18728,582454,30/9/11,700341,Boris,"My buddy and I had a wonderful time staying with Rick & David. Unfortunatelly David was out of town the whole time, but Rick was more than a great host. He was very attentive and helped us out with a lot of tips where to go and how to get there. He even walked us to some places nearby so we don't get lost :-) We had very interesting and delightful conversations together and a very enjoyable dinner at a Thai-Restaurant in the Meatpacking-District.

The apartement is also really nice and very large. We had the whole downstairs-part for ourselves. The bed and the couch where comfatable and the bathroom was very good and clean too. The rooms are lovely decorated and everything is very clean. We were also allowed to use the kitchen upstairs for cooking - in the end we didn't use it though. The only thing that is missing downstairs is a window for daylight and a little fresh air. But Air-Condition is available. We always felt very much like beeing at home when coming back to the apartement.

In addition the area (Meatpacking District) is the place to be right now in New York. It's very hip and trendy and there are a lot of nice restaurants, bars and shops. The new amazing High-Lines starts just one block away. The complex has a doorman, which makes you feel good. And the area seems to be very save too.

We definitly can recommend the apartement for a visit in NY. We have no complains whatsoever - only good experiences. Thanks for a great time to Rick & David!!"
18728,613386,10/10/11,780986,Jeremie,"We have to pass a super stay
Very pleasant apartment has to live with all the comfort which it owes
a place typically very new yorkais and very knack with a charming host has your service I recommend it highly"
18728,644505,19/10/11,580899,Nancy,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Rick and David's home. The location is perfect and convenient to many trains or trains with connections to other trains. The neighborhood is filled with restaurants, nice bars, and retail shops. Buddakan is just a couple blocks away for you Sex and the City fans; this is where Carrie and Big have their rehearsal dinner.

The building is secure with a 24-hour doorman. The basement level is ultra swanky and comfortable. There are no windows because it's the basement which I felt made it cozy, but it does make it easy to sleep in because you aren't able to sense the sun rising. Our hosts provided everything we could possibly need and even offered recommendations for places in the area. Rick is quite affable and made us feel extremely welcome. As my first experience using AirBNB, I can only hope all future experiences are just the same."
18728,729114,19/11/11,748036,Shaun,I had a fabulous stay in NYC. This place is very spacious. It was fabulous to have a private living area! The location is fantastic! Lots of cool things to do and see! Very close to Subway  - which is very handy! Highly recommended! 
18728,777082,11/12/11,1418702,Jerome,"We stayed with Rick (David was away) for 6 days in December 2011 and it has been a great experience. The apartment location is perfect, the place is big, with a complete privacy thanks to a separate floor. But more importantly Rick was a wonderful host, communication was  seamless, he was helpful and friendly yet not intrusive, we just regret we did not have the chance to spend more time together actually! The only downside? The floor for guests is underground, without window, which can feel somehow a little oppressive at times if you are claustrophobic. But frankly all in all it was a great stay and I would recommend them to anyone"
18728,949227,26/2/12,943038,Josh,This was my second stay at David and Rick's place.  Everything in my original review is still true on the second visit.  Its a great space in a great location with great hosts; I couldn't have asked for anything more.
18728,1072820,2/4/12,1421010,Hillan,"Rick was an outstanding host. Friendly, informative and did his best to make sure I felt at home. 
The apartment itself is impeccably decorated, which makes you feel at home as soon as you step through the front door. I highly recommend staying at this apartment."
18728,1117388,12/4/12,1972385,Felicity,"My friend and I had a fantastic time staying at Rick and Daves.  Rick was a superb host (Dave was away), helping us out in anyway we needed, and giving some great advice when we were unsure of where to go.  The location is amazing - close to a subway station with great lines, which makes it so easy to get round New York - we didn't catch a cab once!  The Meat Packing district is brilliant, so easy to walk to great restaurants and clubs from the apartment at night, and to wonderful shops in the mornings.  The apartment is beautiful, and you have plenty of your own space - we enjoyed spending a night in just relaxing in front of tv.  We would highly highly recommend staying with Rick and Dave.  As first time AirBnB users, it was absolutely fantastic - thanks so much guys!   "
18728,1129596,14/4/12,217162,Roberta,"My staying have been great! 
Location & Location & Location: in the heart of Meatpacking's area and just 2 blocks from the blu metro line. So convenient!
Super clean and the rooms' space is huge.
Rick was a great host.
I will definitely come back!"
18728,1178647,25/4/12,1994467,Nadir,"Rick & David are exceptional hosts, very helpful, friendly and attentive to all my needs. Their place is charming, spotless clean and it can easily makes you feel like at home. As a guest I stayed downstairs and it felt like staying in a separate apartment. Very comfortable and cozy!
The location is great - the nearest subway station is just around the corner - and it's also easy to walk around. The neighborought is very lively, safe and filled with good restaurants, bars and nice shops. 
It was my first time in NY and also my fist time with Airbnb and I could not have hoped for anything better! 
Rick & David's place is highly recommended!"
18728,1284518,15/5/12,2044713,Mark,"My stay with David and Rick couldn't have been easier, this was the first time i used airbnb and hoped it would be as good as it sounded and it was , my hosts opened their home to me and were very helpful on any matter regarding info on places to go and see in Manhattan. The apartment is clean and quiet, and the location perfect , near the underground meant no worries about crisscrossing the city. a 5 star experience.. thank you David and Rick"
18728,1308337,20/5/12,1935515,Angus,"David and Rick are great guys with a world of knowledge, experiences and a great sense of comedy.

If your after a great time in New York you will simply love their amazing flat. The 'tomb' is the most incredible refurbished space, but the real value is the hosts themselves. If you are fortunate enough to spend time with the guys, you'll learn to know why.

Amazing flat, great location and hosts with local knowledge... priceless."
18728,1362602,28/5/12,2103036,Akmann,"I stayed with Dave and Rick for over a week and because of that I truly had my best New York experience, starting with Dave & Rick, those guys really make you feel welcome with literally an opened door policy and with  Dave normally at home you always have a reference guide a couple of steps away. they offer you a whole floor to yourself with complete privacy even for the very paranoid. The place is very comfortable and romantic with a Moroccan theme and if you are lucky enough you get a chance to see Dave performs a song as a bonus.
the area is where everyone wants to be and if you are a foodie like me brace yourself to experience the best cuisine that the Meatpacking District has to offer, and if you are a fan of the nightlife get ready to party but one thing for sure dress to impress because the area's best clubs will eat you alive without the proper attire. as far as the shops you're a few blocks away from the best shopping’s in NY and short cab ride from Central Park in a nutshell for my next trip in NYC they better have my dates available because after staying with those guys I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. Go out there have a blast!
"
18728,1640026,6/7/12,1973224,Melanie,"I adored staying at David and Rick's home. Not only is it in an excellent location (the neighbourhood is very safe and close to everything), but it's extremely clean and comfy. I didn't want for anything. I stayed in their home for a month and at all times I felt completely welcome and free to do as I pleased. I'm now trying to figure out how I can spend another month there next year :). "

18728,2417068,26/9/12,2104931,Nat,"My partner and i stayed at Rick and David's amazing apartment for 9 nights in Sept 2012.  Firstly - Rick and David were the most amazing hosts.  We were remotely arranging our wedding from Australia and we found them SO helpful in providing recommendations and ideas for our visit.  When we arrived Rick greeted us and we were delighted to discover we had so much space to ourselves!  Their apartment is second to none and we couldn't recommend staying with them highly enough!  The location was perfect - right in the middle of all the action, close to a train station and anything else you might need.  We can't wait to visit again! "
18728,2586616,12/10/12,3036209,Tris,"Location is PERFECT!  14th street is near everywhere in Manhattan.  Apartment is very near subway.  The guest area is spacious.  The apartment is super clean.  Doorman.  Good security.  Rick was a very good host.  Very warm, friendly, attentive but gives you as much privacy as you want.  He took me out one Friday evening which turned out to be my best night in NYC yet.  My only wish was that David were not on tour and the next time I visit NYC, I will ensure that is the case."
18728,2639123,17/10/12,2594311,Esther,"It was our first time in NYC and it was the best place we could imagine to stay. 
Rick was a most pleasant and accommodating host. He really made us feel welcomed and we felt very comfortable at this place. On top he gave us so many useful and great tipps for NYC that we were happy about! 

Thanks a lot therefore!! 

Unfortunately, we did not get the opportunity to meet David since he was on tour. 

The apartment itself offers huge space and sufficient privacy, so you really feel at home and relaxed at all times. The space was just like in the pictures - spacious, clean, and modern. 
The Location is unbeatable especially if one love good restaurants with great flair.  It is perfect and convenient to many trains.
I highly recommend staying there for anyone who’s looking for a taste of one of New York’s most vibrant neighborhoods, all the while staying in comfortable accommodations. 

If we go to NYC again, for sure, David and Rick will be the first ones we will ask a accomendation again.  

Thanks for taking us as guests.

I hope the space will be available on my return in Spring. 
Rick was a really nice guy and although we didn't get to hang out that much he opened his home to us and made us feel very welcome.

18728,2743090,29/10/12,2577471,Dawn,"We had a wonderful time visiting NYC and were thrilled with the accommodations and our gracious host, Rick.  (David was out of town).  Rick made us feel like his and David's lovely place was a home away from home for us in New York City. His knowledge of the city and hints for great restaurants and places to go were fantastic and made our time there even more enjoyable. He also communicated with David long distance to get more information for us on the local jazz scene which pointed us in the direction of some of the best music we heard while we were there! So if you are considering a stay in New York City you really just have to stay with Rick and David. You will be right in the heart of the city within walking distance of anything you could want and just a subway away from all that Manhattan has to offer!!"
18728,2798601,4/11/12,3465676,Quentin,We arrived at david and rick appartment during the blackout caused by Sandy ! Rick made our arrival really easy and we felt quickly very comfortable in their nice appartment. Rick shared with us some good tips regarding museum and restaurant. The building itself was really nice and we felt very secured. One floor was dedicated to us which we really appreciated. Finally power was restored and we enjoyed even more staying at Rick and David place. Neighbourhoud was exactly what we were expecting few building and a lot of nice street in greenwich! We will be more than happy to come back to their appartment! 
18728,2967234,26/11/12,2994580,Charles,"Rick and David were wonderful hosts although we never had the opportunity to meet them in person as we stayed during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend and they were away. Even though they were away they made arrangements with the doorman for our access to the apt. late in the evening. During our stay they were always very accessible and helpful with restaurant suggestions as well as art exhibitions. When we arrived we spoke with Rick over the phone and he provided a thorough overview of the apartment -what was where etc.  A couple of times I had questions and texted Rick and he responded very quickly. 

The apartment is as described and pictured and HUGE.  And you simply can't beat the location.  Located in the heart of the Meatpacking district there's plenty of shops, restaurants, etc. and it's only a short stroll from two subway stations. Try the brunch at Standard Grille a block away (another tip of Rick's) and the octopus is particularly recommended.

Although the apartment is centrally located and on the ground floor it was perfectly quiet during our entire stay.  

Throughout the experience Rick and David made us feel as if we were staying at the apartment of a friends. They simply couldn't have been more generous in spirit or more welcoming.  We definitely plan to stay there again and hopefully get to meet them."
18728,3005883,2/12/12,3190635,Billy Chee Peng,"When the guest room is bigger than a hotel room, stay here! David and Rick are amazing hosts, always made us feel at home every time we came back from a long day sightseeing and always happy to sit around and chat. It is the most spacious, biggest space I've seen in NYC, not to mention the location is fantastic, surrounded by restaurants, bars, markets, you name it! The house is exceptionally clean, simply can't complain. Definitely will stay here again and recommend to friends."
18728,3036166,6/12/12,2144293,Joanne,"Staying here is the best decision I've made for my NYC trip! Seriously, look no further. Rick and Dave are fantastic hosts and their apartment ticks all boxes.. Super convenient location right in between the best neighborhoods to explore on foot ( Chelsea, Meatpacking, West Village n SOHO),with food always available around the corner and bus/subway lines within less than 5 mins walk. The Highline and Hudson promenade less about 5 mins away only. As a female travelling alone even at night I found the area incredibly safe. The apartment itself was spotless, beautiful and emanates a very pleasant vibe. The basement where the sleeping alcove is, is a magnificent expanse of space. I slept like a log. Wish I had more time to interact with Rick n Dave as they were really friendly and helpful but my itinerary was manic. Would stay here in a heartbeat if they'd host me again!"
18728,3229592,2/1/13,4252409,Flora Et Fabrice," our stay was the hospitality and warmth of the room was beyond our expectations! certainly one of our most enjoyable and David and Rick were excellent! the apartment is very clean, modern and above all consistent with pictures!

18728,3510239,10/2/13,1107251,Uday,"10/10!! 
Rick is the best host I have stayed with ... I entered his apartment as a paying-guest and left as a friend. The apartment is sweet ... and the massive room one gets in the basement is sweeter. 5 star accommodation through and through. One and a half baths ... a massive sofa, a comfy bed, a super sound system, a well stocked fridge and a host who is more than willing to go that extra mile to ensure 'service delivery'.
My experience in NYC was better because of Rick. Hopefully next time I will get to meet David as well. Go for this option and you are guaranteed a great time."
18728,3725032,8/3/13,3444065,Victoria,"Wow! What a pleasure to stay at this luxurious Moroccan inspired den... In the heart of trendy West downtown NYC! Absolutely enormous and beautiful space to enjoy, with all the comforts you could possibly ask for. From a nespresso machine, to TV... to a grand piano, which is quite some ornament :) Unbelievable amount of space and a quiet environment: could this really be central New York City?? Amazing location. David was on tour, but I am so glad I got to meet and spend time with Rick.  Aside from being an impeccable host (and having great interior design skills ;). ) he is just a wonderful person to know. Thank you for your your warmth, humor and conversation. Without question will stay here next time I'm visiting NYC"
18728,4062269,7/4/13,4746490,Heather,"I just spent  the most amazing month with some amazing (Website hidden by Airbnb) a very amazing place!!!  Thank you Rick and David for helping make that possible.  They made me feel so welcome in their amazing home.  I wasn't a guest, I was a roommate:)

The ""love den"" was beyond words.  Romantic, clean, spacious, and private.  I can't wait to come back............."
18728,4211651,19/4/13,4687865,Patrick,"I stayed for 12 days in the apartment, which has the perfect location in Manhattan. You can reach all of Manhattan’s areas within few minutes (the subway station – serving the Blue and L line – is very close to the apartment). However, as you already are in the Meatpacking district you can also just walk to the many bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. During my stay David and Rick were both staying in the apartment and they are truly great hosts; they make you feel very welcome in their home! The hospitality was way beyond expectation. David and Rick were always happy to have a chat with me. They also could give me all the tips and recommendations for stores and restaurants I was looking for. I definitely feel like I have stayed with friends in NYC. The apartment itself is huge and as a guest you will stay in the basement, whereas David and Rick have their bedroom upstairs. It was a truly amazing experience and therefore overall a clear 10 out of 10. I definitely plan to stay there again if I go back to NYC. Thanks again David & Rick."
18728,4358144,30/4/13,440756,Jo,"A.  The location

Dave and Rick's place is situated in what is probably one of the best locations you can choose in NYC, especially if, like us, you're a first time visitor trying to get your bearings. Step out of their apartment; walk one way and you're suddenly in the heart of the West Village and gorgeous Bleecker Street. Walk the other and you step in to trendy Chelsea with its glorious eateries; or take yet another direction and you find yourself on the Highline promenade along the Hudson River.
Additionally, on the opposite end of their block you'll find a Subway station connecting you to the blue A, C and E lines.
There is an abundance of wonderful restaurants and diners within a 5-minute walking radius, suiting every sort of budget, that Mike and I were very much spoilt for choice at most mealtimes. 
Really, the location in itself is a good enough reason to choose their place above others.

B.  The apartment itself
Many people have already described the place in other reviews, so suffice to say it's a 2-floor arrangement: you get to occupy the basement level, done up in a Moroccan theme; whilst your hosts occupy the ground-floor level. The luxuriously furnished guest area is extremely spacious and kept spotlessly clean; it is comfortable and equipped with more creature comforts than you'll probably need while on holiday. It's a wonderful space to kick back and relax during those times when you want to rest your tired feet after walking about the city. Crucially, the fact that it's equipped with WiFi also means that those, like Mike and I, having jobs that require you to frequently touch base with the office can get their email-writing and report-drafting done comfortably and without distractions.
Despite the guest area being designed as an open plan without any doors (apart from the bathrooms, naturally), privacy is not an issue and we never once felt 'encroached' in our space.

C.  The Hosts
Reviewers are wont to call their hosts wonderful when drawing up these sort of reviews, because it's by far the easiest thing to say. Truth is, however, that Rick and Dave are both genuinely lovely people who go that extra mile to make sure their guests are afforded the very best of their hospitality. It was truly a pleasure to stay with them and share their apartment.
Dave was frequently home during the days we were there and was extremely helpful with giving us tips for restaurants and other venues in the immediate vicinity, and even joined us in grabbing a quick pizza on one of the evenings we were there. "
18728,4609226,15/5/13,4511724,Christina & Mark,"Beautifully decorated apartment in the best location- in the heart of the Meatpacking district and minutes walk from exceptional dining, clubs and transport. I absolutely adored David and Rick as they are sweethearts and a pleasure to stay with. Highly recommend- I'll definitely be back! :)"
18728,4803266,27/5/13,4437030,Brandell,"Excelllent location. Great hosts, really friendly yet not crowding! We had the entire lower level to ourselves and it is huge. Only 1 block from the subway that takes you uptown and right around the corner from the Chelsea Market with great eateries and the best coffee ever (Ninth Street Espresso)!

The best people watching around if you like to just sit and see tons of people dressed to impress. There are lots of clubs and restaurants right outside the door! 

The hosts were great and we never felt awkward using the washing machine or using the kitchen to make a cup of tea or store our left overs in their fringe. They really make you feel like you are at home. I asked for a fan since I get hot at night and Rick gave me one right away and they were both so helpful giving us tips on jazz clubs, how to get places and whatever we needed!

We would definetly come back here and highly recommend it to anyone wanting a great experience in a great location!

If you're planning a visit to New York and you are looking for a smart apartment, hospitable and generous hosts and perfect location, then look no further.  David & Rick really made us feel welcome and were always extremely helpful with advice for good restaurants and local attractions.  They are very charming hosts.  The apartment was so well located, right next to Subways and across from great tourist spots including the Highline, Chelsea Market, art galleries and restaurants.  "
18728,5779434,16/7/13,4689768,Nicola,"David and Ricks in our opinion is honestly the best place you could stay in New York. The area is just amazing with lots of cool bars, restaurants, cafes and shops with lovely walks around the streets and near the subway. David and Rick went out of their way to be friendly and give us advice on the area and made us feel at home. You can use the kitchen and washing facilities and the basement area which is huge is completely yours with a comfy bed, air con, sofas, piano and bathroom. Can't recommend this place highly enough, we will be sure to stay here again!"
18728,6240977,5/8/13,6128225,Bettina,"I spent more than two weeks in David and Rick’s house, occupying their comfortable basement with all its fine pieces of furniture and decoration – not to mention a beautiful real piano! Both floors in their loft show the care and taste they have been created with, and every object reflects a sense of beauty. Of course, as other guests before me have mentioned, the house is kept meticulously clean. I very much enjoyed the calm and relaxed atmosphere with David and Rick and the feeling of trust and respect that underlies the day-to-day life. I also had the privilege of benefitting from David’s presence during my stay there, and I absolutely cherished the almost daily long breakfast conversations we shared! Regarding the location, it is indeed great, with the subway and highline being literally around the corner and a few minutes stroll into the village. Thanks to both of you!"
18728,6528177,16/8/13,4799520,Lauren,"You could not choose to stay anywhere better in NYC! Both the apartment and the hosts are amazing. My fiancé and I stayed with David and Rick for just under a week and we wished it had been longer.  We have stayed in other AirBnB rentals in the area and they simply do not compare in terms of space, amenity and decor! The location was also perfect with easy access to the subway, nightlife and the Highline. We also absolutely loved the company as David and Rick are so friendly and welcoming, you feel like you are staying with family.  More than looking forward to our next stay in NYC, we are looking forward to staying with David and Rick. These guys know NYC like no one else and might even be able to tell you about (or take you to) clubs, bars and restaurants you would otherwise have missed out on. You will not find better than this (Website hidden by Airbnb)"

18728,7004733,3/9/13,5345105,India,"My boyfriend and I spent 2 weeks in New York and stayed in David and Rick's apartment the entire time. We were incredibly happy with our choice! The location, right in the heart of the Meatpacking District, was perfect for us. We were a few minutes walk from some great places, such as Chelsea Markets, The High Line, and MANY great restaurants and bars. 

The apartment itself was clean, spacious, stylish and fun - And the designated guest area, is an entire floor with bathroom, TV, couch, coffee table, sofa bed and piano! There was more than enough room! They also had everything we needed - Soaps, shampoo, laundry detergent, toilet paper, milk, towels etc etc!

Despite the fact that David and Rick were away the entire time we stayed in their place (bar one day), they went out of their way to be amazing hosts! They gave us a list of all the places we should see, bars we should go to, even the best supermarkets. They made us feel welcome to ask any questions we had, and gave us great advice on what the city has to offer. They even called us from their own holiday multiple times to make sure we were having a great time!

All in all, a FANTASTIC experience thanks to David and Rick (and their beautiful apartment)! I definitely recommend to anyone going to New York!! Looking forward to seeing you in Sydney very soon Dave!"
18728,7459996,21/9/13,6091104,S.,"David was traveling so I got to meet only Rick. Rick was a very friendly and respectful host. The room, which is actually the basement of their two-story apartment, is very spacious. The bed is comfortable and I was able to sleep late when I needed. The apartment is in a nice, lively neighborhood. I would definitely stay again.

18728,7646094,28/9/13,1622682,Pippa,"My daughter and I stayed with David, Rick was out of town, for a week. What a fabulous place, Rick stayed up until we got there at 11pm and was super welcoming. The place is spotless, devoid of clutter (not sure how they pull that one off). While the bed downstairs is a sleeper bed, it's extremely comfortable,I think there's some memory foam on top, didn't feel like a sofa bed. A bathroom downstairs and one upstairs, a fabulous coffee machine, beautiful decor, and charming host, in a fabulous neighbourhood with glorious restaurants and most importantly, bakeries. What a great experience:)
"
18728,7977735,11/10/13,5620740,Mollie,"This was my very first trip to NYC and my stay with Rick (David was out of town) was fantastic! From the moment I got there Rick made me feel so welcomed. He is very thoughtful and really makes you feel like this is your place just as much as his. He helped with any questions I had and never made me feel like I was annoying him.  The apartment is immaculate!  Very modern but very warm at the same time. The BEAUTIFUL downstairs (where the guests stay)  was exquisite and better than any hotel.  From the artwork to the lighting to the furniture..what an atmosphere!  The sleeping area was perfect. The bed was very comfortable and was adorned with comfy blankets, linens, and pillows. There is a little closet provided to put your things in and also an A/C unit just in case it gets too warm.  The main living area was just as comfortable.  A nice couch to relax on and a TV with surround sound!  It was nice to just veg and watch the telly after a long day in the city. The main loft was just as exquisite .I had full access to the bathroom and the kitchen In fact, I made myself a cup of  Espresso each morning.:)  The location is perfect with just steps away to the High Line, Chelsea Market and lots of restaurants. There is easy access to the subways too.  The village I found was the best part of the city and I'm so thankful I found Rick & David's place. I will definitely be going back to the city and when I do,  I'll always see if their place is available first!  "
18728,8324366,26/10/13,5248055,Amanda,"Absolutely LOVED our stay in this stunning, spacious and amazingly locatated meatpacking district apartment.

Rick was an incredible host - gave us great tips on where to eat the first night, was very accommodating and always responded to queries in a very timely manner.

The apartment itself was probably in the best location in Manhattan. Locatated at the heart of all the best restaurants - literally at the corner of the street! Very easy walking distance to both downtown and uptown - 5th ave, Times Square and Soho!

Already cannot wait for my return to NYC and could not recommend this apartment anymore! "

It's just a couple blocks to the High Line, and close to transit, nightlife, restaurants and great shopping. On my arrival, Rick showed me where everything was, from light switches (there are many) to cooking pots and teacups, and I was invited to help myself to whatever was in the fridge (a glass of orange juice was the perfect start to every day). It was so nice to be able to plug my iPhone into the stereo for my favourite music as I got ready to go out (on surround sound!), and the pullout sofa was very comfortable. Having my own floor was wonderfully private and luxurious, yet Rick and David always made themselves available if I needed them. I felt right at home, and would stay there again in a heartbeat. "

Very close to the subway, and they were a wealth of knowledge for me as a first timer in NYC. Thanks guys!"

While I didn't have the opportunity to meet David (who was away), Rick was very helpful, friendly, and easily approachable.  He was a great resource for transportation info, neighborhood suggestions and even found me a hair dryer (I'd forgotten mine)!  The apartment is terrific and the living space was quiet, private and extremely spacious.  Breakfast is included and comes with an easy to use coffee system.  I'd highly recommend David and Rick's loft.  Subway easily accessible and walking distance to everything...much better than an apartment, especially when needing to stay in NY for more than a couple days.

The place was as described and looked as per the photos, couldn't fault a thing and has everything you need, plus more.  The downstairs area is great, bed is soft and warm,plus cable tv and toilet. Upstairs is the bathroom, but this was no problem as the guys had their own area. 

My husband loved the fact there was an expresso machine being from Australia he loves his coffee.

David and Rick made us feel right at home and gave some great tips for NYC as well as great suggestions for restaurants and bars nearby.

The location is fantastic and 3 minute walk to the subway and close to the chelsea markets and the high line. Subway is the best way to get around and so easy and this location is just perfect to get wherever you need to and we felt safe around the area.   Certainly a fantastic place to stay and we can't wait to come back to NYC to stay again."
18728,12449478,3/5/14,9862543,Andrea,"Rick and David made my first trip to New York a fabulous experience! When I arrived, Rick greeted me, gave me a tour, made me feel welcome and recommended some places to eat that were close by that had great food at reasonable prices. I went to two of the places he recommended, Corsinos (an italian eatery) and Gaslight Pizzeria. Both had friendly staff and delicious food.

I had the whole bottom level to myself and felt like a celebrity. The room was very clean, neat, richly decorated and comfortable. The room comes equipped with its own thermostat and heat/cool unit so you can adjust it to your comfort level. The bed was perfect for one person, two if you are very fit and like to sleep entwined. The mattress was super comfy which is saying a lot since I tend to have chronic back pain. 

I was pretty busy with work and play and didn't get to interact a whole lot with my hosts. However, the few times I was able to talk to them, I found them genuine, interesting and very friendly. 

I would HIGHLY recommend staying with David and Rick anytime you are in Manhattan. Their place is in a great central location, right in the Meatpacking District which is close to Soho, Chelsea and tons of interesting sights."

The apartment is absolutely stunning. As per the pictures, it is immaculate, very large and everything has been thought of. I had my own space downstairs, it was quiet, it was warm, I had a little bathroom to use down there as well as the bath/shower upstairs. I had use of the fabulous gallery kitchen and Wifi.  The location is super. It is 5 mins to subway and 10 mins up to Time Square, 20 mins up to Central Park but with shops all around, the Chelsea markets, and so close to the Hudson River, Greenwich and the Piers, I happily ventured out on foot all the time with plenty to see.

Nabolaget de bor i er sjarmerende med shopping, vintagebutikker, restauranter og barer rett utenfor døren. De bor også like ved en t-banestasjon, noe som er veldig praktisk for å bevege seg rundt i resten av byen. I leiligheten så disponerer man hele kjelleren - så der er det eget bad, sofa og TV med stereoanlegg, tilgang på vaskemaskin og et eget piano(!). Jeg anbefaller et opphold hos dem på det sterkeste!

If you're lucky, Dave may even invite you to go out to show you some of his favorite local places! The 2nd floor of the apartment was at my full disposal, and very comfortable. The apartment is impeccable and I had full access to everything in the kitchen. But really made my whole airbnb experience were the hosts Dave & Rick, who were such nice, genuine people. This was my first time using airbnb & I won't even give it a second thought to book again with them when I'm back in the city. The only regret you will have is if you don't book your stay with them.

18728,31569408,7/5/15,2396122,Claire,"This has been one of my best Airbnb experiences. From our initial communication to my stay, Rick and David made me feel so welcome. I had the whole bottom floor including a very comfortable sofa bed with a nice thick mattress, lounge area and small bathroom. Upstairs I had my own bathroom with shower. I could also help myself to breakfast and coffee which was really kind. I had a lot of privacy but also enjoyed chatting with Rick and David when our paths occasionally crossed. The location was perfect for all my sightseeing and great restaurants nearby too. I am so very grateful to both Rick and David and highly recommend their apartment. "
18728,33580165,30/5/15,30311375,Jeroen,"It was my first time using Airbnb, and it has been amazing experience! Rick and David offer an amazing place. It is spacious and private, with all amenities available. The location is exceptional, with the Chelsea Market, the Village, the new Whitney Museum, the High Line and entrance to the Subway only minutes away. I can't recommend this place highly enough. I'm sure my first time here will not be the last! Thanks Rick, thanks David!"
18728,33994220,3/6/15,5771430,Donny,"If you're looking to stay in town - this is the place to be! Not only do you have a immaculate private room - you have amazing hosts; super friendly, and will help point you in the right direction if you're looking for suggestions. I personally think this is better than any hotel around here. I'm staying here next time I visit! "
18728,35382745,18/6/15,18962730,Shayne,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I have to say the bar has been set mighty high. Everything you have read is %100 true. All the superlatives seem to have been used already and rightly so. This is stylish, gorgeous, welcoming accommodation. As are your hosts. Charming, witty, warm and generous.  My fabulous first time in New York began with the great good fortune of staying here with David and Rick. I did my darnedest to do and see as much of the big apple as humanly possible in 14 days and couldn't have had a better base to do it from nor a nicer reception for coming home to tell the tales. If you could travel the globe sharing even briefly the lives and homes of folk of this calibre what a charmed existence that would be. See you again my friends."
18728,36531907,29/6/15,29071474,Kyle,"David and Rick are AWESOME! 
Super accommodating, very welcoming, warm and friendly - just all around lovely and interesting people.

Their house is in a great location! Walking distance to public transport and heaps of restaurants and shops.

The room is very private and comfortable - enough space for all my items.

Would definitely have no problem staying there again!

Thanks David and Rick! "

Room is large, exactly as in pictures. As it is in the basement, there is no window, but air condition cools the air. Own bathroom is very nice to have. Building has very cool public rooftop!

Location is unbeatable, West Village/Meatpacking District, very close to Chelsea Market.

Can only highly recommend to stay here!

Dear Rick, dear David, thank you so much for making me feel at home at your place!  "

18728,47628813,21/9/15,34125469,Jairo,"Wow! There are not enough words to describe how amazing our first Airbnb experience has been. David and Rick are astonishing hosts that will go out their way to accommodate you. Apart from being extremely cordial, they will give you suggestions on what to do and in our case even invite you for a night out with them. The loft is exactly how it is depicted in the pictures. Very clean, stylish and organized is how you will find your temporary home. The room has a very relaxing environment which is crucial after a long day of shopping and taking pictures in the city. The neighborhood bursts with restaurants, galleries, retail stores, bars and breath taking views. As far as transportation there are plenty of train stations nearby in addition to the taxis and Uber drivers that can be found in the streets at any given time. I cannot stress how great David and Rick are, I have a strong feeling this is not the last time we will see each other. Thanks for the opportunity guys stay in touch."

Some people are just made to be good hosts, and David and Rick are two of those people. The apartment? Stunning. The location? Perfect. I'm beyond grateful that these people exist in a city like this, and for their help in making this trip an amazing one. If you're looking to spend any sort of time in Manhattan, please do yourself a favour and book this place. Except don't book it when I want to be in town! 11 out of 10! "

***BEST PEOPLE***
***BEST EXPERIENCE***

From the moment we walked in we were blown away by our apartment and our hosts Dave and Rick. We arrived in the evening and they were so so welcoming. The photos do not do it justice, it is a massive space to rent of these guys, and a great feel. Also exceptionally clean. 
They were both so helpful with our week stay in New York. Directions, suggestions, do's and donts  and anything we asked if them they we happy to help. I honestly don't think our trip would have been as memorable without Dave and Rick and their beautiful apartment."

To start with, David and Rick's apartment is in the best possible location with only a short walk to the Subway, shops, fantastic restaurants, bars, Chelsea Market, The High Line and so much more. Their apartment is just beautiful, immaculately presented and super clean.  I agree with the other reviews saying that the photos don't do it justice.  It's much bigger in reality and the downstairs area that was ours for 9 nights was completely private, spacious but cozy and again immaculate in every way.  David and Rick went above and beyond to welcome us and help make our stay as amazing as possible.  They were always available to recommend fantastic places to visit, eat and drink.  Staying with David and Rick in their beautiful home definitely made our first trip to New York so much more unique and special than if we had stayed at a hotel. We felt like such locals by the end of our holiday that we didn't want to leave :-)"

18728,58279702,2/1/16,43234289,Natalia,"Upon arriving at David and Ricks apartment we were blown away at the amazing loft the would be our NYC home over the Christmas break. The house was picture perfect, very clean and we had plenty of supplies to last the 13 days we were staying. The whole bottom floor including a living room, bathroom, laundry and bedroom had plenty of character and beauty. Not to mention the fact that we were in the best location in NYC, still close to all of the tourist attractions but very much amongst the trendy atmosphere of the Meatpacking district. While we were unable to meet David and Rick, David fully prepped us and left us a guide to the household as well as recommendations of great places to eat and party! We can not think of a better place to stay in NYC. The experience was definitely heightened becasue of our amazing accomodation and we would highly recommend it! "

Great private space downstairs which is an amazing sanctuary after exploring the best of what New York has to offer. David and Rick took me out many times to experience the life of a real New Yorker and not just a tourist. They gave me plenty of tips of what to do and what to see, helped with getting tickets to events and even cooked for me a few times. A great experience and have made friends for life. The location couldn't have been better with easy access to transport and easy walking distance to heaps of great restaurants/bars/cafes and shopping. Sad to be leaving but will be back again and i know where ill be staying again next time. "

18728,93181593,11/8/16,11165568,Mark,"Rick and David were great and their place was wonderful. It is located in the perfect neighborhood with easy access to a lot of great restaurants and bars. They were the perfect hosts. This was my first time staying at a place where the owners were actually in the place as well. I wasn't sure if I was going to like it but It was actually really nice. You have the whole downstairs to yourself with a half bath and then a shower upstairs in a full bath that is also just your own. They allow you full access to the kitchen but I did not take advantage. I was there for work and had my breakfast and lunch there and then went out for dinners. The place is also very quiet. I got off work early one day and went back to the house and took a nap. Slept like a baby cause it was so quiet. The place is kept up very well clean and nice and the bed is actually very comfortable. I would definitely stay there again and I'm already trying to figure out a time I can come back for pleasure instead of work so I can relax and hang out more. 
I can't think of anything they could improve on. We met up when we said. I was provided with all the info I needed and was on my own. I think their place is perfect for a single person or a couple. I plan to bring my wife back soon and I'm sure we will be staying here. "

The area is safe and very vibrant with great restaurants and bars and if you're looking for a nightlife scene then this is probably the best place for it. For those who don't want to party, this place is within a stone's throw of great places to eat and the stunning Greenwich Village. 

The building has a conceirge desk which was a nice to have. They were very friendly and helpful.

The hosts were fantastic and although we missed them on this trip, they were ever so helpful and we were made to feel very comfortable.

The perfect place for your trip to NYC."

18728,134284900,26/2/17,114517278,Davis,David and Rick were amazing hosts throughout the weekend we stayed. They were very helpful and generous with their house as well as the food and drink they provided us.

The location was great - close to the subway and places like Chelsea Market, Meatpacking District and the High Line.
The mattress and pillows were unbelievably comfortable and there was no street noise, which made it so easy to sleep.
Apartment had all the amenities you could ask for - heating/air conditioning, full kitchen, laundry, private bathroom and lounge with cable tv.
The best thing about this apartment though is Rick and David. They were so friendly and welcoming.
I will definitely be staying here again on my next visit to New York!"

It's a few mins walk to high line, Chelsea market, roof top drinks at the Bain standard and so many amazing places to eat and drink. It's very close to subway so if your going further afield it's easy to get around. We only met Rick as David was away with work. He could not have been more friendly or helpful. Really lovely guy and really lovely place. "
18728,154820766,26/5/17,22471264,Ana,"What a fantastic location, right in the heart of the Meatpacking district and easily accessible to the subway system. The apartment is on the ground floor of a classy, secure building complete with doorman and roof garden. Inside it is modern, well equipped and spotlessly clean. The Airbnb accommodation is in the basement of apartment, it is nice and comfortable and extremely spacious but it doesn't really have natural light. David was away during my stay but Rick was very helpful and welcoming and I thoroughly enjoyed chatting with him each day. "
18728,158543569,7/6/17,14936810,Victor,This is a luxe experience hosted by two very friendly and welcoming people. Rick was my host as David was out of town until the last day but they clearly both know how to make people feel welcomed. I enjoyed my week-long stay very much and am grateful for the experience.

This was exactly the kind of airbnb experience I love, where you actually meet and get to know wonderful people. They were warm and welcoming, which set the tone for a great experience in the city. The space itself is separate from the main living area, with tons of room - a perfect mix of privacy and hospitality. I'd stay with them again in a heartbeat and recommend anyone who's visiting Manhattan to do the same. "
18728,164279785,26/6/17,12753206,Jonathan,"Great place to stay in perfect location for the best parts of Manhattan.  It's as in the pictures, but it is the hospitality that makes this place so special. I felt like a local and a friend.

It's in the basement which is good for quiet and it's a huge space. You have a half bath but have to go up to your private main bathroom. No problem. Not much natural light but that helps sleep, and you're so welcome upstairs it is no issue. The building is great with a roof terrace too.

Thank you for a great stay and one of the friendliest Airbnb I have been to. Your local knowledge and evenings out were fantastic!"
18728,184990296,20/8/17,22154601,Allison,"David and Rick welcomed me to the city with open arms! I was here for a bit of work and fun and looking for a place to live when I move here in a month. D&R were beyond hospitable and welcoming and gave me lots of great tips. I had a very comfortable stay and got some of the best nights of sleep of my life. 

Great location near lots of restaurants, Chelsea market, the high line and easy walk to West Village and Union Square, where I spent most of my time. 

What an enjoyable experience. I highly recommend and will tell my friends and family to stay here when they visit me!"

18728,195260761,18/9/17,139714572,Robin,"My husband and I had never been to New York, nor had we ever stayed at an Airbnb. I had actually never heard of them before. And we have to say  David and Rick definitely raised the bar. We absolutely loved staying at there place. It was tastefully decorated, clean, quiet, and beautifully cozy. When we got to there place we where greeted by a doorman, David welcomed us with open arms  showed us around and we got quickly nestled  in. The building was clean, secure quiet and we felt more than safe. They asked several times if we were o.k or if we needed anything. They had everything we needed. We ate out as we wanted to experience some great New York food but we would have been more than welcome to cook a meal in the shared kitchen that was always kept clean and well equipped. We went to a local market that they had suggested and got some snacks but they were more than generous and told us to help our selves to whatever we wanted in the fridge that was well stocked. 
Well besides having all the amenities we needed and more, We loved the fact we were staying with locals to the area, and what a great location loved it. Everything was close by market, liquor, subways, shopping, and great entertainment. David was more than happy to make some excellent suggestions for places to eat and go out and ways to get around the city. What a great experience David and Ricks is a must stay at if you are travelling to the big apple they are every bit as welcoming and pleasant as their picture shows . We give them a 10 out 5 thumps up."
18728,195985611,21/9/17,810480,Elizabeth,"I wish I could give David and Rick more than five stars. I stayed here during a business trip when every single hotel in Manhattan was at least $400/night (Note to self: don't schedule meetings in NYC during the UN General Assembly). At $156/night, David and Rick's place is an incredible value. The location is ideal--close to the A, C, E train and L train to get across town, and close to Chelsea Market and a million bars, restaurants and cafes. I will definitely stay here again when I am in New York, and recommend it highly whether you're in New York for business or pleasure!"

Rick and David are outstanding hosts and they really made me feel welcomed and I felt very comfortable at this place. The apartment is as described and pictured - spacious, stylish and spotless clean. The basement space is like an Aladdin's Den :) I slept like a log:)) Excellent location! Only 1 block from the subway and right around the corner from the Chelsea Market, everything on your doorstep! 
Highly recommended! 
Thank you guys for making my stay a memorable one;)"

18728,239153655,28/2/18,15935540,Lorri,"When I walked downstairs into what would be my ""home space"" for the next six nights, I was kind of flabbergasted.  I had seen the pictures online but they didn't do the space justice.  I felt like I'd been transported to a seraglio in Morocco or somewhere, but one with a beautiful baby grand, lots of books, super comfortable gigantic sectional with amazing pillows, a big entertainment center, light fixtures from Egypt that I loved just looking at, and a bed on a kind of ""dais"" where I would sleep like a baby every night.  It's the most fun & spacious Airbnb space I've ever had the pleasure of staying in.  And Rick And David were fabulous hosts: generous, helpful, fun and easy to be around.  I had a great week!  
They provided cold bottled water, and told me to help myself to coffee, tea, breakfast makings and treats, which was just lovely for me since I hated leaving the house sometimes!  I was in NY to perform my solo show, and they even lent me a fabulous pitcher to use onstage the night of my reading.  And helped me get my costume cleaned quickly and very well!  Love these guys!
My only suggestion might be that since the half-bath downstairs in the space is so incredibly large, they might want to add one of those new freestanding bathtubs so that the guests don't even have to bother their hosts upstairs when going to shower or take a bath.  They're about to recarpet downstairs, so it will be even nicer for future guests!  I can't recommend David & Rick's place highly enough; if you're looking for a unique, private, comfortable space in a fabulous location, stay here!"
18728,241092052,7/3/18,58739892,Kay,"Wow, what a great find. Above and beyond our expectations. The hosts were the 'icing on the cake'. This is a great neighborhood and location. We were able to walk to most of the places that we visited in NYC. All of the recommendations by Rick and David were great. Make sure to visit Smalls Jazz bar when you visit. Whitney Art Museum is a must, it's the neighborhood with great views of the lower city area and Jersey city. 
Would definitely book this place again."
18728,242347831,11/3/18,163041366,Lee,David and Rick are awesome hosts!  Great location and very responsive.  Their place was better than home away from home!  Lots of private space and very welcoming.  On a scale of 1-10 I give them a 15!
18728,244832585,19/3/18,5089965,Ryan,Honestly this is the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at in terms of location and overall beauty. Very quiet space (almost impossible to find in NYC) and accommodating hosts. David and Rick were incredibly accommodating and the location was perfect. 10/10

Rick was very friendly with great suggestions for things to do and eat as well as local transportation. Very clean and easy access. The only downsides are shower up stairs and smaller but comfortable bed. Very good value and would stay there again if we ever are able to get back. Thanks Rick for a great stay and hope to meet David next time!
18728,257056331,24/4/18,122452015,Melody,David and Rick’s place is a great place to stay!  It was like staying in a romantic Morrocan hideaway with all the modern conveniences one could ask for.  We had complete privacy when desired and free rein in the shared kitchen area.  Everything was spic and span. Rick and David were friendly and gracious hosts who made themselves available to us when needed and provided wonderful information about the history of the area as well as interesting places to check out.  We are looking forward to our next visit!

Thank you both for allowing me to stay.
I will certainly be back!

David is a very kind, generous host & we immediately felt comfortable with him. We had a few rainy days & David provided umbrellas, warm jackets etc.  He gave us great tips on food places, music spots & things to do while in NYC.  We did not get to meet Rick.  However communication with Rick was excellent. 
Terrific value. Most highly rated Airbnb.  It would be hard to find better."

Plenty of room and with access to the upstairs to shower and have a cup of coffee it was perfect.  The location was ideal for us, near the Highline, short walks to great restaurants and jazz clubs.  We can't recommend it highly enough, thanks to two great hosts! John&Julie"
18728,309651058,18/8/18,94114579,Jackie,Perfect Apartment! Perfect Rick and David. Really appreciate for your care to Ray.  Look forward to seeing you in near future.
18728,314277202,26/8/18,198416866,Pratyush,"Location: This place has a very convenient location, with Chelsea Market being almost right across the street. Subway station is there at the end of the street and neighborhood is full of restaurants, bars and markets. If you want to go for a let evening stroll, High line is close by. 

Space: Super spacious compared to match box size rooms that you get in typical NYC hotels. 

Decor & Amenities: Tastefully done place with a very cosy feel. Fully equipped kitchen, washer, dryer are all for your use. Wifi was good as I could take video calls for work right there. "
18764,32512,31/3/10,90725,Dirk,First of all let me say that Lulu is a very gentle person and great host. Uncomplicated  and truthworcy. Her appartment is neat and clean and a god place to stay for visiting NY. 
18764,34578,10/4/10,91129,Tara,"My family stayed in Lulu's apartment for 5 nights and had a wonderful time. The apartment is in a great location, close to restuarants, shops and two subway stops. 

It was a welcome rest at the end of trekking through Manhatan with 3 kids to come back to a charming, clean and well organized home. 

Lulu was a very gracious host and was very helpful and thoughtful. My kids still claim ""our apartment"" was the very best part of New York.  

I highly recommend staying here!"
18764,37034,21/4/10,87563,Laurent,Lulu was a great host. We spent four days at her apartments and it was perfect. It is a beautiful and clean place and Lulu took care of everything to make our stay as nice as possible. I recommend it definitely.
18764,37758,25/4/10,87430,Gwen,"My husband and I had a great stay at Lulu's apartment in Williamsburg. Her place is very organized and clean, and set up for guests. Lulu is very friendly, & accommodating! Would love to stay here again!"
18764,52518,13/6/10,70440,Shimyrre And Boris,"Great place with wonderful character, very clean and well organized. Apartment description is quite accurate (except there is a bed in the second room with the sofa now,nice!) Just be ready to live with the nuances of a 100 yr old building(ie., delicate plumbing) and you'll be fine! Lulu was a gracious and super friendly host. She was very good at keeping in touch before our arrival, found the nearest dry cleaners for us to get our clothes pressed asap, gladly made recommendations on where to eat, and even had bagels, coffee, and tea waiting for us when we arrived. Very cool gal, wish I could have hung out with her! Will definitely stay there again whenever we make it back."
18764,61590,6/7/10,97060,Wei Jian,"Lulu's little apartment was just perfect for our trip to NYC! The place was clean and sweet and we felt right at home from the start. Lulu herself met us at the place when we first arrived, and she was so patient even though we were way late. Extremely helpful and friendly, Lulu's the perfect host. Convenient to get to Manhattan with both subway stations nearby and lively nightlife. The bagels provided for breakfast were lovely as well! The only regret I have now is forgetting to write in her little guestbook on the kitchen table :( We enjoyed our stay at Lulu's place and we would recommend it!!"
18764,64800,15/7/10,101667,Lorraine,"Lulu is a wonderful host, and you can tell she enjoys making people feel right at home. Her apartment is so well organized and furnished, and also very comfortable - we thoroughly enjoyed our week's stay there. She was extremely welcoming, and so hospitable when we accidentally left a very valuable item and had to arrange to retrieve it after we'd checked out. I would absolutely recommend her home to guests who are looking for a peaceful respite in NYC."
18764,68192,24/7/10,127759,Edmund,Very pleasant stay.  One subway stop to Manhattan.  Bedford L is much nicer/safer than other local trains.  We would stay there again.  Only warning to those with ambulatory difficulties: Five story walk up.  Lulu is very nice and caring about her guests.
18764,75309,8/8/10,119356,Gabriel & Lieli,"Lulu's place is awsome, and so is she. My friends and I had a great time. The apartment is spacious, with confortable rooms and beds, very well organized and decorated. It is right on the corner of Bedford ave, and near two subway stations. 
Lulu is lovely and always available on the phone to solve all questions we had. We all loved her and the way she let us so confortable.  She and her place made our trip even more enjoyable.  It was like staying at home.

The apartment was better then anticipated for the price and really right in the heart of Williamsburg. 
Clean and Classy, the apartment was super easy and quick access to Manhattan without the price tag.
Highly recommend and would stay here again.
Ginger put up with 4 guys and made us feel welcome the whole time!
One of us took a yoga class and he enjoyed it very much!

Thanks again Ginger and Lulu!

"
18764,140666,17/11/10,213674,Maureen,"My friend and I just finished a 4-night stay with Ginger. She's the best! We struggled a bit with the four flights of stairs (we are both 60!), but we made it. Ginger provided a personal yoga session for my friend that she really liked.
I think we may be a little past our prime for a cute and funky place like Lulu's and Ginger's, due to the walking required, but it's a great deal!
Ginger arranged transportation to and from the airport for us for less than a taxi ride would have been. Thanks!
On to the specifics ...
The beds are really comfortable and the bedrooms spacious. My friend had a great Tempurpedic mattress, but her room was a little warm the first two nights. My room was really spacious and I had a fan!
Beware... the bathroom is TINY! If you are looking for somewhere with a luxurious bath, this isn't it ... but they NEVER ran out of hot water and I take LONG showers!
Subway stops are within about a 10 minute walk each way and there are some really nice small community restaurants in the area. The train ride into Manhattan was less than 10 minutes.
All in all, a good experience. Thanks, Ginger, for being such a super hostess!!"
18764,170383,14/1/11,319613,Emily,"We really enjoyed our stay with Ginger. First of all, the location of the flat is perfect for enjoying Williamsburg as well as going to Manhattan.. the flat in itself is lovely, very clean and tidy... the only minus for us was the no sink in the bathroom, even  though there's no problem using the kitchen one.. it's just that with a baby and an older man who likes his habits this can be a bit problematic. A part from that, we really enjoyed quiet moments with Ginger and being able to just relax in that nice appartment. The stairs were challenging with the stroller but manageable (who doesn't need the exercise). We would recommend this flat to anyone going to NY!"
18764,232992,20/4/11,431395,Phillip,"Lulu and Ginger were wonderfully accommodating and attentive hosts. They met two separate parties arriving on separate days, explained the subway system and recommended places in the neighborhood, let us leave our bags late, helped us arrange transportation to the airport, and I have forgotten what else!

The apartment is right off the quiet end of Bedford and so there is no end of interesting places to eat and drink and it is also only one subway stop from both Manhattan's East Village and Lower East Side. At the same time it is very quiet.  At night there was almost no noise at all to deal with.  Convenient for visiting Manhattan without sleeping in Manhattan.

The place itself is beautifully decorated, comfortable, and very clean. Keep in mind that this is a real-deal Brooklyn apartment building. There is no elevator, the bathroom is small with the only sink in the kitchen, and the building is vintage. 

To anyone who wants a convenient, clean and authentic place to stay, I would definitely recommend Lulu and Ginger's place."

18764,390045,23/7/11,429696,Helle,"Nice rooms in Willamsburg. We were there with our two boys.
Willamburg is a perfect place for a trip to NY. We were only a few minuts from the sub.
And Ginger was a good host, that help us all throught our stay"
18764,644811,19/10/11,347558,Alberto,"We had a nice stay on this apartment, which is kept with loving care and is just as seen in the pictures. Beds are super comfy, place is clean and features lots of nice details which help forget its few shortcomings (mainly, no elevator to a 5th floor and no separate sink in bathroom). Ginger was a nice, accommodating host to be with, and the place is minutes away from two subway stations to Manhattan, which in turn lets you discover the charm and niceties of Williamsburg - whose atmosphere I preferred for a night out rather than the big city. All in all I can recommend this apartment to anyone who can appreciate details and has no issues with climbing stairs."
18764,654346,23/10/11,110003,Nick And Lylie,"Great location, Ginger is a very warm host.
Nice cozy beds too.
We really explored Williamsburg which was a treat."
18764,739240,23/11/11,798575,Richard,"The apartment is cheerful and of decent size.  Ginger is a friendly host who effectively managed our stay. Just be warned, though, the buildings bones are old, not everything works as it should and if you can't afford to be afraid of the occasional bug. 

Williamsburg is a great place from which to enjoy New York, and the apartment is located between two very useful subway lines. It's surrounded by excellent cafes and bars and fashionable people."
18764,787684,16/12/11,1136215,Stefan,"The apartment is located in a great and popular area. The house is a bit old but charming. Ginger furnished the apartment really lovely. She is a very polite host and well-organized with having guests.
It's just a few minutes walk to the metro. There a couple of Delis in the surrounding. 
"
18764,1064889,31/3/12,1859450,Michael,"Pro's:
- Ginger is a great, nice host
- The location is right in the perfect area, for cafes, bars, restaurants but not too loud, because it's in a side street
- the beds a comfortable
- the apartment is very, very (i mean very!) clean
- the living room is cozy and big
- you have everything you need in a kitchen (even 2 food processors, find this in nyc)
- no complications at all
- 10 Minutes to Subway could be a con, but in this case, you can choose between L, G and JMZ, so in fact it is a perfect spot for using public transportation service.

Con's:
- 5th floor, you should be fit ;-)
- no balcony (smokers, must mount a lot of stairs :-)
- the bathroom is really small, and the bathtub should be replaced someday
- wifi is only working at two windows (open wifi) but still fast enough for streaming.

Why still 5 stars? There is no place without con's. And those con's are not that crucial. And the price is definitely reasonable.

I would rent it again.. Maybe I will..."
18764,1082942,4/4/12,673987,LeBechi,"Ginger was a very welcoming and sweet hostess, and made us feel very comfortable at her place.  The location was really good for getting into Manhattan, although you need to be prepared for a ten minute walk to ANY subway.  There are not as many public transportation options in Brooklyn as in the city, but being 3 stops away from NYC was great.  The apartment itself was cozy and very cute, but does need some upgrading in a few places - mainly the bathroom.  The neighborhood itself is pretty quiet and has lots of charming shops and restaurants, but the building and upstairs neighbors are loud at all times of night.  Bring earplugs for a quiet night's sleep and you should be fine.  To set your expectations:  I would definitely recommend staying here for anyone looking for a place that is much nicer than any guest hostel but older and not as modern or comfy as a hotel, with a great hostess and easy access to the city!"
18764,1371461,29/5/12,2005879,Kimberly,"Lulu's apartment was exactly as advertised, and Constance was very helpful during our stay.  Thanks so much to both of you!"

It is lovely, nicely decorated and the perfect place to relax, chill, talk or to make some quick pancakes in the morning. Perfectly situated, right by Bedford Ave in Williamsburg with loads of cool cafés, bars, shops, and even close to the water front :-) Lulu was a great host and Constance was very helpful in giving advices - they both really made us feel at home. We will come back whenever possible. THANK YOU!"

The hosts were very helpful and friendly. The location is great here, a short walk to a range of fun eateries and a subway stop. Would most definitely stay here again! "
18764,3737024,10/3/13,4842358,Elena,"It is a wonderfull apartment, in hip Williamsburg. For my taste a little to hip, but since the appartment is in a quieter street it is a good hideout after a long day walking New York.
The (Hidden by Airbnb) Constnce and Ronan are nice and you barely even see them, but this is not an appartment you have to yourself. It is however very bright colorful and clean, such that even a grey day seems sunny ;)
"
18764,5097306,12/6/13,5239157,Elisabeth,"Lulu was a great host. The flat is frienly, clean and very welcoming, and situated in a great neighborhood. We enjoyed a lot to stay in one of the cafes and restaurants at night at Bedford Avenue which is just around the corner. Our little son Leander also enjoyed to stay here. Constance and Ronan were very pleasant flat managers. We hope to be back soon to this great place."
18764,5672277,11/7/13,5323285,Brunno,"
We just loved to stay in Lulu's place! It's a quiet, clean and beautiful apartment that tell us about the Brooklyn history.
The  bed, towels and shiets were clean and nice! It was a little bit hard to ""climb"" all the stairs, but worth it!
The neighborhood is very secure and good, and the apartment is nearby the subway (Marcy station).
About Lulu: a very sweet person!! We are glad to meet her!"
18764,7238550,13/9/13,6683202,Iris,We´ve had a wonderful time in a cool neighborhood. The flat is really cute and clean. We enjoyed our stay a lot - anytime again!
18764,7587370,25/9/13,3748213,Greg,"I stayed at Lulu's place during a recent business visit during which my companion and I planned to be very busy. We needed a quiet space to spread out with a lot (a lot!) of equipment. Ronan and Constance -- the live-in managers -- were quiet as mice and, on the occasions we saw them, very pleasant and helpful. We clicked quickly and would have enjoyed having had the time to get to know them a little better than our trip allowed.

Everything about the apartment was exactly as advertised -- it was quiet, fully stocked, spacious and ""cozy"" without feeling cramped. Constance was very responsive to emails, as was Lulu, even though she lives in another country. 

My only note of caution is to take heed that it is on the 5th floor of a walkup, as noted in the ad. Hauling a lot of heavy gear up to the apartment was a back breaker (but certainly not fault of the renter). It's something to keep in mind if you have very heavy bags or more than you can easily carry in one trip.

In all, a highly recommended place in a quiet neighborhood with excellent hosts."
18764,8993749,1/12/13,5573389,Becci,"The apartment is charming and like the photos, its brilliantly placed right by Bedford Avenue for great bars and restaurants. Handy for the Marcy Ave subway (JMZ). The live in Managers are lovely and helpful, keeping themselves to themselves but approachable for questions. Though I still think the overview shouldn't say whole apartment when it isn't. (sharing a bathroom with no lock isn't a whole apartment to yourself)
The bathroom is small (as stated in lots of people's reviews) That's not a problem..however the hole in the bath and at the time of our visit the leaking ceiling wasn't ideal. (Lulu and Constance apologised and as its not their fault but a leak from the apartment above which is understandable but not great!) The only other thing I would say is the electrics are all pretty interesting, which in a really old building I guess should be expected, random sockets and the intermittent wiring on the living room light (Constance and Ronan can show you the hit the wall trick, but its not always successful!)
The five flights of stairs are quite an undertaking but we had thighs of steel by the end of the week!! 
We were touched by the gesture of pumpkin pie and ham Constance and Ronan shared with us on Thanksgiving was lovely!
Overall great stay though make sure you have fully read and understood the WHOLE LISTING!!!
Thanks Constance, Ronan and Lulu. "
18764,10800999,8/3/14,8440599,Jay,"Cozy, warm, clean.  No issues and everything well communicated.  Very good location, central to everything in the area just off Bedford and near Driggs."
18764,11827205,16/4/14,9986493,Osman,"Our stay in this apartment was unfortunately not pleasant !

The bathroom (sink in the kitchen) :
rusted shower, no way to wet shave in the kitchen, because there is no mirror.

noise:
Kitchen and living room :
The fridge is very noisy and running almost constantly,
the apartment is very loud, you can hear the neighbors (cough, sneeze, and how they scream at their children) as if they were standing in the own apartment,
besides that, a neighbor next door makes renovations any time of the day and until late in the evening.

Room rear:
From the inner courtyard there are very often loud noises to hear, probably because the 
caretaker works out the garbage disposal on the ground floor. This makes that it stinks in the room.

We have been looking for a quieter place for the weekend and are pulled out for two days.

By our return on Sunday evening suddenly in addition to Constance (manager of the apartment) 2 more people were in the apartment, living in the room of Constance. So we werde unexpectedly five persons in the apartment! The use of the bathroom was quite limited. A person went away early on Tuesday morning and woke us up ruthlessly by 3am , the day of our departure (bevor a long travel back home) . Too bad, after the many positive comments, it was for us very surprising and disappointing in the way the accommodation was in reality.

Unser Aufenthalt in dieser Wohnung war bedauerlicherweise nicht angenehm!

Das Bad (Lavabo in der Küche): 
verrostete Dusche, keine Möglichkeit zum nass rasieren auch in der Küche nicht, da kein Spiegel vorhanden ist. 

Lärm: 
Küche und Wohnraum: 
Der Kühlschrank ist sehr laut und läuft fast ständig, 
die Wohnung ist sehr ringhörig, man hört alle Nachbarn (husten, niesen und wie sie ihre Kinder anschreien) so als würden sie in der eigene Wohnung stehen, 
dazu kommt, dass ein Nachbar in seiner Wohnung Renovationen vornimmt zu jeder Tageszeit und bis spät am Abend. 

Zimmer hinten:
Vom Innenhof her sind sehr oft laute Arbeitsgeräusche zu hören, da vermutlich der 
Abwart dort die Kehrichtentsorgung im Parterre macht. Dadurch stinkt es im Zimmer.

Wir haben uns für das Wochenende eine ruhigere Unterkunft gesucht und sind für zwei Tage ausgezogen.

Bei unserer Rückkehr am Sonntag Abend waren dann plötzlich zusätzlich zu Constance (verwaltet die Wohnung) 2 Personen in der Wohnung bzw. im Zimmer von Constance. Da waren wir unerwartet zu fünft in der Wohnung! Die Badbenützung war somit recht eingeschränkt. Eine Person ging am Dienstag früh weg und weckte uns rücksichtslos morgens um 3 Uhr, an unserem Abreisetag. Schade, nach den vielen positiven Kommentaren war das für uns auf diese Weise doch leider sehr überraschend und ernüchternd, was wir in Wirklichkeit angetroffen haben.

18764,11982252,21/4/14,9246594,Allison,"What a great apartment.   We loved the old building and the neighbourhood.   I would recommend the larger bedroom that faces the front of the building (great memory foam bed), but sadly not the other bedroom because the bed was a back-breaker.    Communication was excellent with Lulu and Constance.  The kitchen and living room were great.   Very clean and always lots of hot water for showers.   The only problem we had was with some guests of the managers who stayed one night in the managers' room and left the door unlocked twice (one of those times they left it wide open overnight!).   When we complained in  the morning the guests were gone swiftly and Constance apologized.   The Easter treats for my little one were a very kind surprise our last morning.   She was over the moon to have an egg hunt. :) "

We slept really well even though the beds were quite soft. The neighbors were friendly and the location for this flat could not been better, close to everything!!

The communication with both Constance and Lulu throughout the week was quick and sweet. Quick internet connection and a well equipped kitchen.

We would differently choose to stay here more times and we highly recommend the flat to you and our friends.

18764,16971073,5/8/14,7349366,Uwe,"Das Appartment von Lulu liegt im momentan sehr angesagten Williamsburg/Brooklyn. Zur Metrostation Marcy Avenue (M, J) ist es ein kurzer Fußmarsch von knapp 10 Minuten. Zur Bedford Avenue (L) ist es ein wenig weiter aber gerade am Abend kommt man hier an sehr vielen netten Kneipen vorbei. 

Die Wohnung liegt im 4. Stock ohne Lift und mit einem schweren Koffer ist es schon etwas beschwerlich dorthin zu kommen. Dafür ist die Wohnung sehr schön, stylisch eingerichtet und sehr gemütlich. Das Bad ist etwas eng und es gibt kein Waschbecken darin. Wenn man also Wert auf viel Platz und ein geräumiges Bad legt, ist diese Unterkunft vielleicht weniger geeignet. 

Da Lulu während unseres Aufenthalts nicht in New York war, hatten wir praktisch die ganze Wohnung für uns alleine. Lulu war aber stets erreichbar und hat sich auch mehrfach erkundigt, ob alles in Ordnung ist und sie noch etwas für uns tun könne."
18764,18644725,30/8/14,10580999,Cosima,"The stay was perfect. 
The appartment is very well located, Williamsburg and Bedford avenue are really nice. There are lots of good restaurants and a big supermarket to do groceries close by. Manhattan is only one stop away in subway. The apartment is colorful and quite comfortable. You can access to the roof to see the wonderful sunset above the skyline. 
And most of all, Lulu is the best host you could wish for :)

During some of the coldest days of the year, it was a warm and comfortable place to retreat to. Claire was very nice and easygoing and, though we didn't overlap much, she was welcoming and accommodating! The space was very clean and comfortable and we loved the neighborhood. Parking wasn't even bad! We would definitely stay again! Thank you Lulu and Claire!"
18764,28474894,24/3/15,27687716,Barrie,"Look beyond the weathered (boy do they have weather here!) building façade to find this delightfully warm, light, cosy yet surprisingly spacious apartment in the Williamsburg neighbourhood of Brooklyn.  Well situated between the Subway stations (lines) of Bedford Avenue (L), Marcy Avenue (J,M,Z) and Broadway (G), travel between here and the rest of Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Manhattan is effortless.

Very well presented with a lot of character and charm containing everything we needed: 2 double rooms, bathroom (with in bath shower), all linen, spare toiletries, towels, full use of the kitchen (although you're likely to be eating out most of the time as it is a lot less expensive and you're on holiday!), guest information library, guest welcome booklet and a selection of games.

The Williamsburg neighbourhood appeared to be very clean, safe and was a stones throw away from the waterfront. A plethora of shops, coffee houses, bars, art galleries, restaurants and public outdoor spaces meant that we only scratched the surface of what there was to discover in the short time (5 days) we were there.

Our host made us feel welcomed, relaxed and even stayed awake to greet us for our delayed (the taxi drivers seem not to be required to know where anything is!) 2am arrival! - we would not hesitate to book this accommodation again."

Even the tiny bathroom is sufficient, if you do not expect a 4-star-hotel ;-). Even more, the flat is cozy and very convenient (e.g. close to the subway, close to supermarket, nice / hip area). The communication with Lulu and her apartment manager (Claire) was very easy: short response time, always reachable ...

L'appartement était très propre, à proximité de 2 stations de métro (qui mènent à Manhattan en 2 arrêts) et à l'angle de la Bedford Avenue rue animée et très agréable.  Le quartier en pleine gentrification était très calme et compte de nombreux commerces ouverts 24/24, ce qui est appréciable après l'effervescence de Manhattan.

Jonah, le ""apartment manager"" a été très accueillant et nous a recommandé des adresses dans le coin. Lulu a été très sympathique et a toujours été disponible et très réactive par message (dommage que nous ne l'ayons rencontré que le dernier jour).

Seul point négatif : Jonah  n'était pas là à notre arrivée (il avait une urgence)...nous avons donc attendu une petite heure qu'il arrive.

I've stayed in Brooklyn many times and the area of her apartment was just perfect - short walk to the L Train, restaurants, bars, etc! From the moment we walked into Lulu's apt, she was full of energy and so open to us! Everything was so cute and cozy! Lulu baked us corn muffins that were so yummy as well! I will definitely come back! Thank you Lulu!"
18764,50912665,16/10/15,9204013,Torben Lindy,My wife and I stayed at Lulu's apartment during week 42. We had the most fantastic time during which we enjoyed Lulu's company from time to time. She would help us in any which way we requested with a smile. Her apartment is really nice and you feel  at home right away. You'll find anything you need there. The apartment is located very near the main street Bedford Avenue which is very vibrant and lively with lots of bars and restaurants. We highly recommend Lulu's apartment. 
18764,53041103,4/11/15,9815914,Lisandro,"Lulu was the best host we could have. Always attentive and very cool. The department was immaculate, clean, tidy. Close to the best places in Williamsburg, but not so close as to hear their sounds if you want to sleep ... You have at least 3 subway lines fences to move to the places you want in Manhattan (J, M and L). It is really perfect! We would return without hesitation."
18764,53808212,13/11/15,12837247,Alejandro,"Lulu was extremely nice and hospitable. Not did she only take the time to write in each occasion before our arrival, but she was very active in making sure we had all the information needed. It was not me who actually stayed at her place, but three friends of my mum's.
This said, I tried to cancel the reservation TWO months in advance and she declined my request. I have my apt in airbnb myself and I know how inconvenient it is to get cancelations, but two months in advance is honestly enough time to get new guests.
Besides, even if the description of the rental is clear in the description, it appeared catalogued among the 'whole apartment' adds, which is misleading, for there is actually someone living there.
Finally, these friends of my mom's were not very happy either about the amount of stairs you need to climb or about the dirtiness: I cannot say anything about these two issues since I never saw the place. I have to add that it was their first time using airbnb and her expectations might have been wrong.
The location, as Lulu says, is perfect. And the person living in the apartment, according to my mom's friends, very nice as well.
Overall it's a place I would recommend, but you should be really sure you want need to change your rental. And do make sure to read that it comes with someone in it."
18764,55352310,1/12/15,10359555,경미,"Lulu was kind and nice host. Thanks to Lulu, I had great time staying in Brooklyn. Fancy restaurants are all around. Good location, cozy, neat. Recommended!"
18764,56662258,16/12/15,45283231,Hayley,"Lulu is completely amazing ! So brilliant to communicate with, made the whole air bnb experience wonderful. She was so accommodating. She also kept in contact with me the whole time, checking how I was doing and recommending places to go and see and places to eat etc etc. She also made everything so easy for me when I made a mistake with arrival dates!  

Her apartment manager was great, made me feel really welcome from the get go. My friends joined me a few days in and we all had such a fab time !!! I will 100% be coming back and telling everyone to stay here too. Perfect location, perfect apartment :) 

Honestly couldn't be more positive about Lulu and her place and her apartment manager ! 

Thank you !!!!! :) 

Also a brilliant spot for reaching Manhattan (within minutes) and also for a really fun evening in Williamsburg...near amazing restaurants, bars etc etc

I would love to meet Lulu!! Hopefully when I stay next time ! "
18764,69632319,12/4/16,29645703,Henk,"Dear Lulu,

We enjoyed our stay at your apartment very much. The apartment was just as listed, well equipped and cozy indeed. Great neighborhood at such short distance from Manhattan. We didn’t mind the steps but were glad you mentioned it. Key pick up and drop off went very smooth. Appreciated your quick response to our messages, especially considering the time difference with Kenia.
The last night we met Rayner; a very friendly guy. We were a bit confused about the use of the 3rd room the first night, but it worked out fine eventually. We hope you’ll find a way to help your neighbors resolve their issues. 

Best regards, Marianne, Monique and Henk

Safe, comfy, friendly environment is key to a nice NY experience. Yaya takes care of all the details. If you're looking for a nice place to stay, this is the one. Nice TV, kitchen, tea, coffee, and you can cook anytime. It's a tourist dream come true! 

The neighborhood is nice, you'll be 5 to 10 minutes by metro to the museums, and the metro station is just a block away. 

I definitively recommend Yaya's places. It's better than a hotel, and almost home. "

The apartment is so beautiful and with your own keys you can come and go everytime. Subway is only a few steps away and it takes only 20min to the city.

So you should book it before someone other will do!!!

It was immaculately clean, very bright, lots of space and fully upgraded.  The location was very good - park across the street, shopping nearby and subway 2 blocks away.

Nicoletta was a very accommodating host and made every step of the process as easy as it could be.

I would rent this unit without hesitation and will again in the future.

Thank you Nicoletta!

It is very close to the subway in a very colorful neighborhood. Great as a base to explore a really fabulous city! Thanks again.
19159,103312,23/9/10,201500,Ramona,"We had a great stay in New York - and much of that was having a great apartment to come back to after an active day.  Spacious, immaculate, and very comfortable. The apartment was true to the pictures.  While not in the heart of Manhattan, buses on Broadway and the subway stop two blocks away made getting around the city a breeze.  Check in and check out went very smooth. I highly recommend ""luminous and spacious"" apartment. This was my first Airbnb and it was great. "
19159,115844,11/10/10,21743,Sylvia,"Photos give a very accurate depiction. Very nice interiors, spacious and comfortable apartment. I really enjoyed the nice light and lack of clutter in the apartment. 
Location is extremely convenient, 2 blocks from subway on Broadway..can be in Columbus Circle in 10-15 minutes.  I returned around midnight a few times and area felt very safe.

19159,261437,13/5/11,259836,D.C.,"Hi all, we stayed at Nicoletta's spacious luminous apartment for 9 nights (2 persons). It was really great. The apartment has everything you need and is very clean. The kitchen is very well equipped. My friend used the bedroom and I used the sofa-bed in the middle room, we slept like babies. The metro is just 1 block away (5 minutes walk) and from there you are in the centre of Manhattan in a blink of an eye. We very much enjoyed our stay in New York City, everything worked out well and we would definitely rent this apartment again should we decide to come and visit NYC another time. Many thanks!

Neighbourhood (Washington Heights, north Harlem) was OK, lots of small shops nearby on Broadway. Transportation (subway) close for line 1, a few blocks away for other options."
19159,510397,7/9/11,765889,Javier,"It's been a pleasure to stay at Nicoletta's. She's been really helpful since the beginning, always in touch and answering all our doubts, besides she sounds (through email and by the phone) very very nice :)

Regarding to the apartment, what to say, it's incredible, very comfortable and very well equiped. Even though it seems to be far from the center, you have a subway stop (145 st -line 1) behind the building and within 20 minutes you are in times square. The neighborhood is not as busy as the center of manhattan but it preserves that pleasant hustle from the big apple.

I'll be back  in NYC, that's for sure,  and I hope I can stay at Nicoletta's apartment again.

Nicoletta,  it's been great ""knowing"" you.

Take care. Hugs

19159,539518,17/9/11,996263,Marta,"The apartment is really beautiful, really comfortable, really spacious, really clean, really luminous. It's perfect for 4 people and if you want for 5 too. When we arrived, we met Nicoletta's assistant who received us and who explained us some simple rules of the home. We also found some food for the breakfast. 
The only negative side is the big distance of the apartment from the main attractions of the city. For example it's 20 minutes far from Times Square with the subways or with taxi you can spend 25-30 $. 
The neighborhood is quite but there aren't there any restaurants, attractions or places to visit.
But a positive side is the price: it's very convenient!!
On the whole we are glad and pleased about our choice to stay in this apartment and about the owner Nicoletta of the home who was very kind and helpful with us and our questions."
19159,580016,29/9/11,199396,Joachim,"Having spent about two weeks in Nicoletta's apartement I can give it the highest marks. It is bright, nicely furnished, impeccably clean and adorned with works of art by the owner herself, who is a professional artist. The location is somewhat on the outskirts of Manhatten, but the subway line no. 1 is very close by. (Hint: Change at 96th Street for the express trains 2 or 3 to get faster to the City.) The neighborhood is ""ethnic"", mostly hispanic and black. It is safe - I walked around a lot during all times of the day without the slightest discomfort. Although not around in person, Nicoletta has been very helpful and most friendly. "

Mi sono messa alla prova, insieme abbiamo organizzzato tutto e le preoccupazioni non erano poche,soprattutto gli interrogativi senza risposta.
Attraverso AIRBNB,con la disponibilità della gentilissima signora Nicoletta,ho potuto gustare al meglio queta mia nuova esperienza di vita.
Nessun intoppo,nessun inconveniente.
La città di New York è talmente complessa,viva e colorata che stancherebbe anche un allenatissimo maratoneta .per noi quindi era piacevole la sera poter tornare nell'appartamento Spazioso e Luminoso della Sig.ra Nicoletta per riposare mente e corpo.
Pulito,accogliente,intuivo il passaggio di tante persone che come noi vi hanno abitato senza però notare un deterioramento.
Siamo felici di questa bella esperienza.

The building is easily accessible from the subway, plenty of parking as well, an elevator and a ramp. The apartment has everything you could want for your temporary stay in the city: clean linens, towels, fast internet connection, a kitchen stocked with the basics if you plan to do some cooking. I felt very much at home. Nicoletta was very easy to get in touch with if needed and always so pleasant.  I would absolutely stay in this apartment again and also look forward to her property in Italy one day!"

Although the host was not around, she was very attentiive. We definitely had the impression she wanted us to enjoy our time in the apartment.
Nicoletta's assistant was also very friendly and helpful."
19159,1274942,14/5/12,178277,Grant,"Nicoletta's Riverside Drive apartment was, as advertised, large, spacious, and light. It's also well equipped and thoughtfully decorated. For visitors needing work space it was particularly useful having a large desk and comfortable office chair. Communication with Nicoletta throughout the process was efficient, and check-in and out with her assistant - Nicoletta was out of town - went exactly as planned. Two bits of advice to potential visitors. If you're travelling as a couple note that there's only a double (rather than queen or king) bed in the bedroom; there is also a double sleeper couch in the living room. If you're a light sleeper this apartment may not be for you because of the traffic din from the Hudson Parkway close by; otherwise just bring earplugs."

The AP is great! very comfortable, spacious and have everything we need (We thought it was smaller but got surprised). The light apartment in summer time... UFF! AMAZING. Is the best choice you can do with your NYC vacations.

Thanks Nico! =)

El apartamento es genial! muy cómodo, espacioso y tiene todo lo que necesitas para una estadía perfecta (Cocina equipada, baño, wifi, tv, aire acondicionado, blower, plancha, toallas, sábanas). Tiene una luz bellisima en horario de verano. Es bien seguro, cerca del tren 1 a dos bloques, y el Bus M19 en la 145 que te lleva directamente al tren A-C.

Secondly, the apartment is extremely comfortable, exactly as shown in the photos, the area is very quiet, a bit far, but with a subway station a block away.

I loved the walk-in closet:-)There's a lot of beautiful light in the flat as on the pictures - and a big mirror. We loved Nicoletta's artwork - so colourful and inspiring to wake up to every day - it really added something special to the experience. Also, Nicoletta was very welcoming and communicative and her ideas and recommendations of art galleries, contemporary art museums and a lovely local restaurant was a great help and inspiration to us. There's a swim and a park closeby and the flat is close to the subway station. Our arrival and departure went smooth and Clara who helps Nicoletta was very kind and welcoming. We'd love to come back to stay in the flat and give our best recommendations. Thank you so much, Nicoletta! Our kindest regards, Anne Marie and Anders Michael, Copenhagen"

This began with our first written communication with Nicoletta, her gracious warmth was very welcoming, her honesty reassuring. Consequently, there were no negative surprises. Her apt.was very quiet, spacious and full of light, very comfortable indeed. On days of rest, we stayed  in the neigbourhood, walked in Riverside park by the Hudson river. It was only 5 minutes walk to the subway and bus transportation was great. For us, it was ideal: safe, and totally satisfying our sense of adventure. We never had the pleasure of meeting Nicoletta but she was with us in her emails. It was Clara, her assistant, who warmly welcomed us and gave us the keys and apt information we would need.

19159,5246069,20/6/13,6339397,Kathryn,"Nicoletta is a wonderful hostess - friendly, generous, and responsive - and her assistant Clara is quite proactive and so very kind.  
Small glitches (as happen on every trip) were dealt with expeditiously.  
Nicoletta's lovely Hamilton Heights apt has large south facing windows that bring in lots of light.  The bedroom has a treetop view of Riverside Park with the Hudson River in the background from one window (open the gate) and nicely kept townhouses from the other.  Hardwood floors, newly renovated bathroom and kitchen, a very comfortable queen sized bed with soft sheets, plenty of towels, and even a nice superintendent in the building made this a great find.  
Note:  I stayed in June while beautiful weather was abundant.  Block parties with music did occur until 12:00 am two nights out of seven.
If you are a previous resident of NYC (as I was for 17 years) or a new visitor, you may not know this part of town.  In that case Riverside State Park (across the street and down a sloping walkway toward the river) will be a delightful find (a small fee for Olympic swimming pools, tennis courts - free collegiate running track and weight room).  
Best of all, Riverside walkway runs from North of here to the tip of the island.  Take a day to stroll South along the Hudson River past long stretches of towering high rises to Chelsea Piers and beyond.  Go inland and take a tour of the Freedom Towers and 911 museum.   

Subway or bus travel is easy from here.  Buy a metrocard from a machine taking cash or credit in a subway station or from a local bodega. Use one of the cab or private car apps to get a cab on Riverside Drive

If you want to shop Madison Avenue or hit the clubs in SoHo, this is not the apt for you.  This is a home base that feels like home - if you live in an apt that was decorated by an artist with a clean, clear, brightly colored, somewhat minimalist sensibility!"

According to the Description of the Apartment it says it´s light and calm. Yes, it is very nice and light but calm…well…
the Apartment is on a corner at the Riverside Drive with fairly busy traffic. Below this street goes another route along the river. Traffic from there you hear quite well even at night so bring earplugs!

Besides the traffic noise at nights I will approve to the description of the apartment. We felt at home and comfortable and the location was very good in terms of closeness to both the shops and the subway.

Attention! Remember that you can´t check in on Sundays at all and not later than 7 a´clock in the evening the other days of the week. Our flight from Sweden landed at 9 a´clock in the evening and it would take us perhaps another 1,5-2 hours to get to the apartment.  It was then too late for us to get access to the apartment. I understood that it was too expensive for Nicoletta to have an assistant receiving us late in the evening. A bit surprising for us considering that we paid a substantial sum for staying in the flat for 10 nights. The first night we therefore had to stay in a hotel. I have rented apartments earlier (in Europe), it has never happened that a late arrival has prevented us from being able to check in the date of arrival. We didn´t arrive from next door so to say. 
    
With respect to not being able to check in the arrival date and the traffic noise we will still recommend the apartment.

Kindly
Anne-Marie and Lamia from Sweden

19159,12655633,7/5/14,12577637,Catherine,Un appartement bien équipé et spacieux (nous étions 4) bien placé sur la ligne 1 du métro (20 min de Times Square) avec des supermarchés proches. Nous avons été bien accueillis par l'assistante de Nicoletta qui nous a bien tout expliqué. La chambre principale est un peu bruyante la nuit à cause de la route proche et d'une mauvaise isolation au niveau du climatiseur. Je recommande cependant cet appartement.
19159,13984779,9/6/14,12412919,Alvaro,The reservation was canceled 103 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
19159,15249591,6/7/14,10777167,Eleonore,"I spent 2 months in this apartment with 2 of my friends and I must say it is a perfect place for a long time stay. The apartment is very well equiped with everything you need for cooking, and plenty of room for personal belongings, and a very pleasant bathroom. The beds are very confortable, and there is plenty of linen. 
There is a washing machine in the basement of the building that can be used for 5$, and there is even an iron and ironing board in the apartment. 
We really felt like home during these 2 months. 
Nicoletta is a perfect host : she was ready to answer all our questions before we made the booking, and even called me just before we left for NY, and this makes us feel quite confident. 
She also stayed in touch with us during the stay, always ready to help us with kind and useful advice. 
Carla, who welcomed us on our arrival and regularly came for cleaning, is also a very nice person. 
The situation is very convenient, near the metro which takes you everywhere you need, and near places you can go shopping. The neighbourhood is quite safe and secure. 
I recognize that the heavy traffic on Riverside Drive can some times be a nuisance... 
I highly recommend this place.

19159,17426172,12/8/14,10739770,Claudy,"We stayed with Nicoletta in her fabulous apartment in New York for almost a fortnight in the summer of 2014. We loved to meet her and we loved the vibe in Spanish Harlem. Every night was like coming home. The apartment is very comfortable, room enough for housing all the four of us (family with two teenagers). Good bathroom, good kitchen, good airconditioning. Lovely decorated, very stylish! Metroline 1 is only two blocks away and within walking distance there are also other lines available. Making arrangements with Nicoletta was very pleasant. Her responses were so quick and to the point. She gave us great tips about the surroundings. We definitely recommend her and her apartment and would like to stay there again the next time we'll visit NYC. "
19159,32876052,23/5/15,16554115,Mihai,"My daughter and her boyfriend had spent almost ten months in this apartment, as freshmen at the New York University. The apartment was a true home for my kids, with all the necessary amenities. The space is ample, with a lot of natural light - in short, a beautiful apartment.
The proximity to the subway station was a big plus.
Our relationship with Nicoletta, the host, was very good. Everytime we needed to get in touch with her she was very prompt with her answers and everytime she provided all the help or clarification, as needed.
Nicoletta is really a great host.
For both reasons: the apartment itself and the host, we warmly recommend this apartment as a good place to stay in New York: a nice apartment, with a lot of natural light and very close to the subway. What more could one ask for?"
19159,55653096,4/12/15,11967943,Alan,"I love Sybilla's apartment. It is extremely roomy and has plenty of room for 2 people. It is well appointed with modern kitchen and bathroom. On sunny days the apartment is flooded with light and it's comfortably furnished with some lovely antique pieces. It's also very handy for transport, shops and Riverside Park for walks. It is right on Riverside Drive which can be noisy in the mornings although personally I didn't find this a problem as I am used to wearing earplugs.  Sybilla was extremely friendly and helpful in her communications.  I highly recommend the apartment and hope to stay there again on future visits. "
19159,66867016,25/3/16,38888423,Rouven,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay at the apartment for almost three months. The apartment is very convenient with generous space, tasteful furniture and a fully equipped kitchen, which makes it easy to feel at home. It is a very bright place with sunlight all day long. We appreciated the excellent transportation link (Subway 1, which takes you directly to most of the landmarks in the Midtown and Lower Manhattan, is only two blocks away) as well as the groceries and many takeaways in immediate proximity. The neighborhood is safe and calm. Sybilla was a perfect host with fast and courteous responses to every query. We highly recommend this place and look forward to come back any time. "
19159,74377383,15/5/16,50752895,Marlaina,"Myself and a friend, stayed in Sybillas apartment for six weeks. We very much enjoyed our stay over the six weeks, the apartment is very spacious and comfortable. Ideal location as it was close to the subway and food stores, we also felt safe in the area. Sybilla and her assistant Clara were very helpful and dealt straight away with any queries we had. overall an excellent stay. "
19159,89757045,29/7/16,31096466,Florine,"Sybilla was an incredible host. My roommate and I stayed in her apartment for 2 months (June/July) as we both completed grad school. Sybilla always responded to emails, questions and was understanding of any issue my roommate or I had. "
19159,122509525,23/12/16,17838722,Mike,"Our stay at Sybilla's place was fantastic! We had everything we needed and the apartment was perfect for the two of us.  We rented the apartment for our semester at Columbia and would recommend this to anyone who is thinking of doing the same.  The apartment was spacious and we felt at home a lot sooner than expected.  The apartment is just as described and comes with everything that is mentioned.  What is not mentioned is the amazing care and attention that visitors receive from Sybilla.  The service was over the top, and she was quick to reply to any issues that we had (such as deciding on cleaning days, activating the heating, etc.) and was very professional.  The communication between her and the visitors was exceptionally good.  We loved our stay here and would book with Sybilla again if we return in the future.  Overall, the experience was a 10/10 and we cannot complain at all.  "
19159,152097259,14/5/17,11967943,Alan,"Super large apartment with 2 public rooms and nice modern kitchen- very near subway, buses and Riverside Park."
19159,223058016,31/12/17,30687613,Sharon,"Sybilla's light-filled apartment is an oasis in Manhattan. The apartment is large with plenty of space for a couple. The kitchen and the apartment overall are fully equipped for a long term stay (we stayed for four months).  Sybilla is a terrific host. She responds within minutes with answers to questions, or solutions to any issues that might arise. The apartment is ideally located for exploring the city (the no. 1 train is two blocks away). The neighborhood has lots to offer on its own in the way of restaurants and basic food shopping, and Fairway Market is an easy walk away through Riverside Park. For long-term guests, there is a wonderful park right across the street with a 50 meter 8 lane pool and a running track with very reasonably priced monthly memberships.  We highly recommend Sybilla's apartment and we are already thinking about booking it  again."
19159,277558050,16/6/18,1277468,Jenny,"Our stay at Sybilla’s apartment surpassed our expectations. The space is beautifully decorated, is in a lovely quiet neighborhood close to Riverside Park, and ya all the amenities we could possibly need for a comfortable stay. I highly recommend this space for anyone who is hoping to enjoy a comfortable home away from home. "
19159,300157786,1/8/18,1277468,Jenny,"Sybilla's home could not have been more comfortable or stylish. It truly felt like a home away from home.  The space is even more beautiful and cozy in person than in the photos, and we really enjoyed Sybilla's art work! There are many delicious restaurants and coffee shops popping up in this neighborhood, and we looked forward to our morning cup of coffee at The Chipped Cup every day. It is conveniently located one block from the 1 train, and just a 10 minute walk from the A, B, and C trains. Riverside Park is just down the street, and there are lovely quite streets with views of the Hudson River that we enjoyed walking daily. "
19169,32982,3/4/10,12678,Jen,"Great neighborhood, spacious digs and all the basics you need to feel entirely at home in NY's Lower East Side. Really great stay!"

19169,333000,25/6/11,101968,Marisol,"Really enjoyed my stay in this NYC apt. Good light, spacious rooms and simple but has everything you need. Living room couch is comfy for chilling and the 4 person dining room table is great to sit and eat or work at. Beds were comfy. It's up a 4 flight walk up, but it wasn't bad. Place was very clean as well. "
19169,510479,7/9/11,828963,Carney,"We loved this apartment. It was super clean and comfortable, and it was in a really great location. Joanna was really helpful and left a list of suggestions and contacts for our stay. I'd definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking for accommodation in NYC. "
19169,561865,24/9/11,615229,Katherine,"The apartment looks just like it does in the photos and is in a fabulous location, well within walking distance to all of south Manhattan and with the subway just round the corner if you can't be bothered walking. The kitchen is big and spacious and everything is well stocked.The building itself is very quiet but I wouldn't say it's a quiet street – but then I'm a light sleeper and I think it's pretty standard for NY, and it's nothing that earplugs can't deal with. 
We had a great time at this place and I thoroughly recommend staying here. "
19169,608202,8/10/11,901535,Sally,Joanna was helpful and responsive. Her place is simple but comfortable. Exactly how it looks in the photos. We stayed with our two teenage kids and it was a great base for exploring the city. Excellent location. Plenty of places to eat and Essex St food market nearby as well as a great local subway. Short walk to Soho and East Village. Fab.
19169,641741,18/10/11,424622,Simon,"The apartment is nice and airy with a good sized kitchen and bathroom for a week's hol. It was a little noisy in the early mornings, though I think we were unlucky with some street works happening outside for a couple of days.

The apartment is close to some good bars and an excellent coffee shop (88 Orchard). The close subway made it really easy to explore NYC. A really nice place to base ourselves for our break. I'd certainly recommend."
19169,731388,20/11/11,1184460,Josue,"Apartamento muy bien situado, limpio y con bares cerca que no molestan si quieres dormir. Muy cerca de lineas de metro al centro de manhattan y aeropuerto jfk. Muy recomendable

Very well situated and clean appartment. There are several bars near but don´t disturb anything. Very close from subway lines to manhattan center and jfk airport. Very recomendable"
19169,829366,3/1/12,1266668,Savvas,"Cute apartment at a perfect location in the heart of the lower east side. 4 people (2 couples) stayed here during xmas and new years. It is a quiet building and neighborhood, and everything you might need (bakery, deli, bank, pharmacy, bars and resurants) are just minutes away. Host was very helpful, accommodating and prompt in repsonding to inquiries!
Thank you Joanna!"
19169,1231574,5/5/12,1346740,Amanda,Booking with Joanna was a smooth and easy process. She is prompt and organized - she sends a thorough and helpful welcome email about the apartment and the neighborhood before check-in that everyone appreciated. Her apartment is true to photos and it is in an excellent and convenient location in NY.
19169,2451619,30/9/12,2107354,Karen,"My husband and I, with our son & daughter, both in their early twenties stayed in Joanna's apartment for  2 weeks. Before our arrival, communication with the host was excellent.  The apartment was clean, airy and spacious; exactly as presented on airbnb. Also, it felt very secure. The location was just perfect for all of us. This apartment was an excellent base and we would definitely, stay there again, should we be so lucky to return from sunny Sydney. [One note, there are no keys for the bedroom doors, so best not to lock them.]"
19169,2539108,8/10/12,3387024,Xavier,"We spent a very nice week in Joanna's apartment. It was simple but clean, comfortable and convenient (short walk to the subway station). 
We enjoyed the neighborhood very much. There are good restaurants and an excellent coffee shop ""88 Orchard"". I'd certainly recommend."
19169,2639919,17/10/12,1585740,Dan,"We were a group of four that had a wonderful time in Joannas place.
The location was great, with lot of things happening at every corner in the neighborhood. Easy access to subway as well as walking distance to Soho and East Village. 
Check in and check out were smooth as Joanna was very flexible and she also quickly answered the questions we had.
After a week we wished we could have stayed longer and would highly recommend staying here for anyone visiting New York."
19169,2775046,1/11/12,2557967,Garth,"Joanna's place was such a comfortable, clean and easy place to stay at. It's in a fantastic spot with so many great restaurants and bars around, yet just far enough away so the noise isn't too bad. The LES does get noisier at night on the weekends but we just put fans on to cover any ambient noise from the street.
As a host, Joanna is really responsive and has put a lot of thought in to make the place comfortable. 
We got caught in Hurricane Sandy during our stay and Joanna was really helpful, checked in with us and made sure we were ok after being stranded at JFK.
The place matches all the great reviews."
19169,2894290,16/11/12,2193919,Danielle,"We got caught up in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy but Joanna kept in contact with us and was very helpful in answering questions and making sure things were sorted out for us.  
The apartment was a great base to explore the city.  It was clean and comfortable.  There was heaps of room for 4 of us who stayed for a week - 2 reasonable sized seperate bedrooms with queen beds.  LES is a great neighbourhood to stay in.  Lots of restaurnats, bars and shops nearby.  Check out the Tenement museum if you have a chance.  It is also very convenient for public transport.  
The neighbourhood can be quiet noisy overnight, particuarly on the weekends, but nothing that a pair of earplugs or a few drinks won't fix!  
The only con that I can think of is that the heater can't be regulated so can be quite hot at times, particuarly at night.  Again, easy fixed though with opening a window.  
Would definitely recommend to stay!  Joanna is a great host."
19169,3023110,4/12/12,3027344,Liam,"Nice apartment in a great location, Joanna was very helpful and made our stay easier for us. Would recommend staying here if you're looking for a cool place to stay in the Lower East Side."

19169,3306777,8/1/13,3364941,Alexandra,"This is a wonderful apartment. The apartment is in a fantastic location - the Lower East Side if very accessible by public transport - with a subway station 2 blocks away that till take you right into midtown and anywhere else you want to go. Around in the area there are plenty of bars, shops and restaurants to keep you occupied without even having to leave the area - Bar 169 and Dudley's to name a few. Great coffee shops right around the corner too. The apartment itself is in good condition. It very easily fit our four guests - with generous double beds and plenty of sitting room in the living room. The bathroom and kitchen are nice and large (for New York) as well.  The heating isnt amazing - it's controlled by the building so we found it a little chilly for our liking. Ended up just putting on more blankets and jumpers. The heating in one of the bedrooms doesn't seem to work. The apartment is located on the top floor of an apartment block that doesn't have an elevator - so be prepared to carry your luggage up 7 flights of stairs when you first arrive.
Small cons aside, this is a great apartment in a great location in New York and we would thoroughly recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in the city."
19169,3514318,11/2/13,4378665,Savannah,"The apartment was great! It was even better than pictured. For such a long stay, we were really able to feel at home here. The neighborhood was very friendly and easily accessible!
"
19169,4488230,8/5/13,4051237,Josh,"I had an amazing 3 weeks at Joanna's apartment. 

Really central to the Lower East Side - fantastic cafes, restaurants and bars all within a hop, skip and a jump of the apartment. Also only a few minutes walk to the subway which can get you uptown or to Brooklyn relatively easy.

If you're not sure where to stay in NYC - this is the place for you! A 15 minute walk gets you to Soho, Little Italy, Nolita & Chinatown.

Similar to the other reviews, note that there are 4 flights of stairs & no elevator, however don't let that worry you.

It was still fairly cold in NYC however there were no issues at all with the heating.

You do get a little street noise, but its NYC after all!

Joanna was a wonderful host and I had no problems at all. I did leave a jacket behind but Joanna was able to ship it to me without any stress or troubles.

Overall, it was great to come back to the apartment after a busy day out and about. I have absolutely no hesitation recommending Joanna's apartment to family and friends and of course anyone reading this!"
19169,4604396,14/5/13,254528,Belinda,"Joanna's apartment was just as the pictures show. It was spacious & clean with 2 very comfortable beds.
There was a lot of closet space & shelves for our belongings. 
I love the area- lots of great cafe's & shops. 
My colleague & I were very comfortable & would gladly recommend Joanna's place to others. 
Joanna was very thorough in her communication & I felt would be available very quickly if needed- however we didn't need anything whilst there."
19169,6145991,1/8/13,5534304,Audrey,"I stayed in the apartment for 2 months over the summer. 

Check in was very easy, Joanna was very accomodating to when I needed to check in and provided me with keys and gave me an overview of the apartment. 

Amentities- everything you could need was there, towels, plates, toaster, extra sheets, dvd player. I really did not need to buy many extras. There was even essential food items like salt, pepper, ect so if you needed to cook that was all there (this may vary depending the the stay though). The apartment was very clean and I never had any problems. Joanna even asked if we needed a new air conditioner since it was so hot during our stay. We never had a problem with the AC and the two window units worked very well and pretty quickly. 

The apartment is on the 4th floor of a walk up but it was not very bad at all. For laundry- there is a really cheap place around the corner that will do it for you. TV- there is only very basic cable but I was pretty busy so it did not really matter. The beds were pretty comfortable, I put a extra blanket under the bed to make it a little more fluffy but it is nothing to stress about. There was also a ton of hangers which was nice. 

The building is right across from a school and is relatively quiet for NYC honestly. Around the corner there are a ton of restaurants (my favorite is this awesome mexican place Barrio Chino). The F train is a block away also. If you like to run, the Williamsburg bridge is like 5 blocks away and is a great work out. A lot of my favorite bars and shopping are on ludlow or a 10 minute walk so it is a really great location. 

Overall- my roommate and I had a wonderful stay and it was very easy to work with Joanna. If we ever needed anything, she was always willing to help. I would definitely recommend this apartment in the future.Great place to stay! "

Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour dans l'appartement de Joanna, on se sent rapidement à l'aise, les photos sont représentatives du lieu, Après de longues et éreintantes promenades dans New York,retrouver un petit nid douillet est un plus. 
La décoration est soignée et cosy, chose très appréciable, l'appartement est très propre et vraiment confortable!!
Nous n'avons pas eu le plaisir de rencontrer notre hôte,mais à notre arrivée une de ses amies était là pour nous accueillir de façon très sympathique
Tout le long de notre séjour nous sommes restés en contact avec Joanna par mail, elle a répondu à toutes nos sollicitations de façon très rapide, nous donnant en prime des petits conseils shopping pour ma fille de 21 ans.
En bref, un appartement très bien et une hôte très disponible.Nous le conseillons vivement à tous ceux qui veulent passer un super séjour sans mauvaise surprise.

19169,7734968,1/10/13,6356265,Bettina,"I recently stayed at Jo's apartment with a friend.  The apartment was just as Jo had described.  Nice and roomy and everything you would want.  The area was fantastic, we didn't visit the same bar or restaurant twice - so many within walking distance. Close to transport and a nice 20 minute walk to Soho which was great.  The top floor was a bit of a challenge with the suitcases, but once you were in, it was fine.  We found the stairs great exercise.  The unit was lovely and light and very secure.  
Jo was a pleasure to deal with - we would definitely stay there again."
19169,11666766,11/4/14,9551475,Jonathan,JoLynn was very straightforward and accommodating. Very easy to deal with.

19169,12539088,5/5/14,1184310,Bryony,"Great communication and lovely flat in a great location. Really spacious for a NYC place. Comfy beds and a super nice living room to hang out in with comfy sofas. It's an old tenement so has some idiosyncrasies, the steam heating is quite noisy, and the main bedroom fronts onto a busy LES street so bring some earplugs if you want to sleep late."
19169,12895113,13/5/14,14006414,Sylvain,"L'appartement est situé dans un quartier agréable, animé, à proximité immédiate des commerces, bars, dinner... et de la station de subway Essex street, ce qui est très pratique....
L'appartement est agréable, lumineux mais souffre malheureusement d'un manque d'entretien flagrant, d'une bonne insonorisation, l'ensemble des équipements étant très largement amorti. 
Les chambres sont spacieuses avec une literie de bonne qualité. 
La salle de bain est sombre et exigüe avec un aspect ""bricolé"" indigne d'une location. 
L'appartement ne dispose pas de connexion (Website hidden by Airbnb) faut dont se tourner vers les commerces de proximité disposant d'une connexion wifi.
Une désinsectisation serait souhaitable car la présence quotidienne de cafards dans la salle de bain et le salon n'est pas très agréable.....
Les parties communes sont vétustes.
Le standing proposé n'est pas en conformité avec le montant du loyer demandé, avec un malentendu flagrant sur l'emploi du mot ""renovated"""
19169,13187995,21/5/14,13960446,Mari,"First of all, Joanna is excellent at communicating. She always responds within a few hours (or sometimes minutes!) From the booking process to confirming your arrival details to contacting you the day before you're about to leave, she makes it all so easy. 

Wow - what a treat it was to stay in Joanna's apartment! It was exactly how it was described. We were met by Joanna's friend, Roger, who helped us carry our luggage up the four flights of stairs (thank you Roger!). The apartment has everything you'll need: hair dryer, coffee maker, iron, etc. It also has a really peaceful vibe to it. It was tempting to stay in every night! The back bedroom is quieter and darker (which I prefer) and the front bedroom is along the street so there is a bit more noise. Joanna has a standing fan that we put on at night and the white noise would drown out any street noise so we actually slept really well. You never hear any noise from the neighbors or ever see them. It really felt like we were at home. 

The area where the apartment is located is surrounded by tons of cool restaurants with lots of hipsters walking around (fyi, be sure to have dinner at Stanton Social) and the subway is only a few minutes away. But, also check out the amazing food in Chinatown and Little Italy, too! There's also a gigantic (and I mean gigantic) Whole Foods about a 10 minute walk and a wine store next door to it with a decent selection of inexpensive wines. I could go on and on but the lower east side has absolutely everything you'll need or want - and I can't even begin to tell you how close it is to walk to SoHo...

Thank you, Joanna, for making our girls long weekend trip so memorable! I can't wait to get back to New York and stay here again! xx"
19169,13470979,28/5/14,12976843,Nicole,"The apartment was just as described, spacious (especially by New York standards) located in charming and vibrant neighbourhood.  
The appartment is in a great location in Lower East Side with everything you need within walking distance: transport, great coffee, grocery store and many wonderful bars / restaurants. 
The appartment is located on the 4th floor with a walk up which apart from the small challenge with the suitcases it was fine to handle.  
All up we really enjoyed our stay."
19169,19031572,5/9/14,2898423,Katie,"JoLynn was a great host. She is excellent at communicating. There were a few minor issues, but these were dealt with swiftly, which was really appreciated. We found the apartment to be as it was described; clean and comfortable, accommodating the four of us with relative ease. The beds were great, and we were able to sleep quite soundly. The furnishings were a lovely touch of character. & the location is great! It is located close to the subway and around the corner from some great restaurants and coffee shops. We really enjoyed our 2 week's of holiday in New York. It was a treat to stay here! Thanks JoLynn!"
19169,20331749,28/9/14,13373482,Andres,"Joanna tiene un hermoso y confortable apartamento. Los ambientes son  más amplios y comodos de lo que se puede ver en las fotos y el lugar tiene todo lo necesario para pasarla muy bien. Está muy bien ubicado: a 150 metros tiene el subway  F, J y M. En pocas manzanas alrededor hay muchos lugares para comer o tomar algo y escuchar música (en LES hay muchos lugares para escuchar rock). Está a 5 min a pie del Soho y Nolita y si quieren escuchar blues caminando 15 o 20 min o en 5 min de metro llegan a Greenwich Village. Y lo mas importante, Joanna y Jared son unos excelentes anfitriones. Nos dieron muchos consejos sobre lugares para visitar y disfrutar. La comunicación con ellos es muy accesible y rápida y se interesan en que los huespedes estén bien. Volvería a alojarme sin dudarlo en este apartamento la próxima vez que visitemos NYC."
19169,22291032,3/11/14,3233057,Ruth,"This is a great location to use as a base to explore NYC. It is in a fantastic neighbourhood with lots of amazing places to eat and cool bars within a block of the appartment. You can easily walk to lower manhattan, TriBeca, SoHo, Little Italy,NoHo and NoLita. Then there are 2 subway stations that are really close and will take you anywhere else you want to go. There is some street noise, which is to be expected, but very little noise from the neighbours. JoLynn was really easy to communicate with and the check in process was really easy. "
19169,22770508,14/11/14,7705724,Carlos,"Pasamos 7 noches en la casa de Joanna. La casa es tal y como se muestra en las fotos. Cómoda y acogedora. Muy bien situada cerca de Little Italy en un bloque donde hay magnificos restaurantes y establecimientos. Tiene estación de metro al lado con línea directa a pleno centro de Manhattan en unos 15 minutos.
Joanna respondió a todas nuestras dudas rápidamente en todo momento y nos ayudó en todo lo que requerimos. Nos informó debidamente antes de llegar a la ciudad y permitió que dejásemos nuestro equipaje la mañana del último día después del checkout hasta que salimos hacia el aeropuerto por la tarde.
Sólo criticaría tres cosas que podrían mejorar la estancia de futuros huéspedes: la calefacción no funcionaba en una de las dos habitaciones aunque no pasamos demasiado frío, a pesar de estar bastante limpia encontramos algún insecto en la cocina (hay que cuidar esas cosas porque deslucen mucho) y por último creo que está de más hacer pagar la lavandería de sabanas y toallas a los inquilinos después de desembolsar 100 dólares de limpieza.
A pesar de ello, nuestra estancia fue agradable y recomiendo la casa y la atención de Joanna. Gracias.

19169,23521318,3/12/14,1766520,Markus,"My dad and I had a great 6 day vacation in NYC and were lucky to stay in Joanna's appartment. It provides enough space for at least 3-4 persons if needed, it's very clean, cozy and feels very safe. Around the appartment you'll find dozens of eateries, coffee bars, delis etc. Everything you need is in close vicinity, even easy access to the subway and busses. We just haven't met Joanna in person, but maybe next time :) Key hand over and appartment description went easily anyhow!"
19169,23774695,9/12/14,1546851,Leslie,"JoLynn was very responsive and flexible in our last minute booking.
The apartment is as pictured, NY-large and comfortable, in a great neighborhood (lower east side 2 blocks from the Tenement museum, great bars, restaurants, shops, chinatown and several subway stops.) Especially liked Amuse wine bar, Vita coffee shop, September wine store, Congee Village, plus Reformation and Szeki for fun but not expensive women's clothing. ODD had great (expensive) designer clothing for men and women. Katz deli is an experience and excellent but expensive pastrami sandwiches.

Bring or buy bath soap and shampoo as they are not provided."

Really the only thing we didn't like about the apartment was the five story walk up, but you get used to it and it is not a big deal. I would definitely recommend this apartment for people staying in NY, especially young people who are looking to go out and explore bars/nightlife. "
19169,47487532,19/9/15,36686844,Clarisse,Awesome location in the Lower East Side about 3 min from Delancey subway station. Just be careful with the five flights of stairs. Joanna made the check in and check out easy and seamless. There were several things that needed service/cleaning left from the previous tenant but Joanna was quick to respond and helped us get service in a timely way. She was easily accessible by email or phone. I would stay here again for a long term stay. Perfect for a month!
19169,52309476,28/10/15,29878403,Hugo F,"Acabamos de chegar, de uma estadia de 35 dias. O apartamento é exatamente como é descrito, confortável, amplo, bem localizado. O bairro é repleto de bares e restaurantes maravilhosos. Você está a duas quadras pequenas da estação do metrô que o levará a uptown: ""Times Square"", ""Broadway"", ""Rockfeller Center"" e muito mais. Fácil deslocamento para o aeroporto também.
Local absolutamente seguro, durante o dia e a noite. Conta com ""Pharmacy"" service 24 horas, o que inclui um mini mercado, e na esquina tem um ""Deli"" 24 horas também. Serviço de lavanderia a menos de uma quadra. Lojas interessantes e o Tennement Museum estão bem próximos. Você estará a poucas quadras da Chinatonw, Little Italy e Soho. É muito bom camninhar por lá, fazer compras, almoçar ou jantar em excelentes restaurantes. Sem falar nos cafés e sorvetes...
Joanne é uma excelente proprietária. Super profissional!! 
Recomendo muito o imóvel!!! Não tenho absolutamente nenhuma restrição ou consideração negativa a fazer."
19169,53046294,4/11/15,5342722,Alex,"Joanna was very casual easy to deal with, key pick up was not a problem despite Joanna being out of town. The apartment is old but really good. Had to turn off the heating system during the night to eliminate a few noises, light sleepers bring ear plugs! It didn't bother me but be warned there are 68 steps from the street to the apartment door!

The neighbourhood is great, walking distance to Soho and lots of fantastic restaurants and cafes around the corner. I would certainly stay here again."
19169,56780824,18/12/15,46440776,Sophie,"My sister and I stayed in the apartment for over 4 weeks. We really loved it! The neighborhood was amazing, lots of bars, restaurants and cute little shops. 
5 minute walk to my favorite neighborhood Soho! The subway is around the corner and will take you anywhere in the city.
Joanne was a lovely host! She made sure we had the key(s) and she provided enough sheets and towels for our whole stay.
She's very nice, always replies when you have questions and she made sure that everything was okay.
The apartment is on the top floor, so make sure you don't have a problem with walking stairs everyday. The streets can be a bit noisy, so when you're a light sleeper make sure you bring earplugs.
My sister and I had an amazing time and on our next trip to the city we would certainly stay there again!"
19169,63116560,20/2/16,4797891,Alex,A comfortable apartment in a great location. Walking distance to many great areas to explore with more restaurants of any cuisine just a block or two away. Jo was great to chat to and helped us throughout our stay when we asked. My tip is to check out Vanessa's Kitchen which is only a couple of blocks away for the best (and cheapest) dumplings I've had so far. 
19169,66798027,24/3/16,36802049,Spiro,"The location was fantastic, and I am very appreciative that JoLynn could handle our last minute request. She was pleasant, communicative and a caring host."

The flat itself was wonderful, though the walk up was a good workout. A good size for our party of three."

The neighbourhood is great with lots of bars, restaurants and museums.
The subway is really close for quick access uptown or to Brooklyn.
Jo was very communicative and the whole process for checking in and out was easy.

Overall a big thumbs up!"
19169,71138651,24/4/16,4001314,Jana,The apartment was in a great location and exactly as pictured. It was plenty roomy for three women to share. The neighbors were quiet although the area is busy and the radiators loud at night so recommend ear plugs. We were disappointed that the coffee maker was broken and the pans too rusty to feel comfortable using to heat water. This is a no frills accommodation and the first time in my history of holiday rentals that I needed to make arrangements for laundering the bedding and towels. It is usually included in the cleaning fee. Bright and sunny and overall a good place to stay while visiting Manhattan.
19169,74299942,14/5/16,1372945,Arleen,"The apartment is at a great location and the neighborhood is fantastic. It is a walk up and we had some problems with a leaking sink, but it was fixed pretty soon. On a Sunday! So thank you for that!

19169,110779207,28/10/16,18222528,Sheila And Greg,"Jolynn did a great job of communicating with me during the process and was accommodating and available when we arrived late at night and were a bit confused about location of key, etc. The location of the place was great and it was clean when we arrived. Both beds very comfortable.  All was good, though it did get cold and the main heat in the building had not been turned on yet. I ended up sleeping in my down jacket the last 2 nights (note: I do  run cold and it didn't bother my friend quite as much). A portable space heater would have made it much more comfortable. There was also some confusion about paying cash for the apartment to be cleaned and prepaying for the laundry at the end of the stay--because the cleaning fee was already factored into the overall price via the Airbnb site. After talking with Jolynn we didn't need to pay those extra cleaning fees. 

 Other then that, it was a great apartment for us and I would recommend it to others! "
19169,135825803,6/3/17,9248572,Nikita,"Positive:
- Good well equipped and furnished apartment in a lively vibrant area, where you want to go out and be out there; 
- Easy check-in - all very well organized;
- Quick communication (helped with a portable heater for the 2nd bedroom)


Improvement points:
- Very noisy: At any point in time day or night 85 dB. 1) During the day time - there's an open construction site (tentatively running through 2018); 2) Old heating system making loud noise (80-85dB) every night at 4 in the morning;
- 5th floor - a bit complicated with large suit cases (good training though :) ).
- No microwave; dishwasher; washing machine (closest laundry 2 blocks away).
- Leaking tap in the kitchen. Not fixed in 4 months;
- Communication is quick, but not always solution driven"
19169,148429498,30/4/17,3770270,Devyn,"THE NEIGHBORHOOD!!! 

The neighborhood that this airbnb is in is SO cool. There are tons of delicious, super hip spots for food, coffee, drinks, etc within blocks. We were so so happy with the location. 

The apartment overall was also great. Clean, cute and a decent size for a prewar apartment. Wifi worked great (which was a big deal for us as we were traveling for work). One of the couches was pretty long and very comfortable. Totally a viable option for a third person to stay on, though I can't remember if you are allowed more than two guests. 

Only two small cautions that make this a 4 instead of 5 stars. Turns out a 5th floor walk up is a bit of a bummer. Day 4 of coming back from a long work day and then having to climb 4-5 flights was tough. No elevator. Second, the shower was tough to get hot water in. The hot water is probably shared with the rest of the building, so sometimes we were fine and other times it was a cold one. 

Like I said, great great great location, well kept up and a super value for what and where it is. Check in was easy and there were very clear house rules and institutions which I appreciate. (If you don't like rules you might want to check this out before booking.)

It's a winner! Book it!"
19169,150685496,8/5/17,9795425,Guy,"My coworker and i had a good stay at JoLynn's apartment.  We were in NY for work and didn't spend much time in the apartment, but the location is amazing and the size was good for two people."

19169,250931265,6/4/18,100972143,Irmak,"It's very good location and clean place. However, the heater in the street-facing room has a very loud-weird noise. We stayed there for a week and each night, it started producing ""bam-bam"" kind of sound around 5 am and we had to sleep on the couch in the living room because there was no way sleeping with that loud sound. Since you can hear the sound from the living room, we never had a nice sleep. It was annoying after paying that much money for the apartment. And since it's a very old apartment and heater system I don't think that it's something fixable."
19169,267402689,21/5/18,52207952,Ruth,"JoLynn’s place was exactly as shown in the photos. Lots of public transport very close. The apartment is situated within walking distance to Soho, Little Italy and East Village. The lounge area is spacious and great to relax in after a big day of exploring. 
The apartment was in the 5 floor of a walk up which was great for staying healthy. It is across the road from a school and I felt that contributed to the feeling of safety in the area.
Thanks for a great stay."
19169,309679750,18/8/18,54005724,Nick,"Misleading, broken, and invasion of privacy. Initially thought this property would be an amazing place for a summer in New York. Unfortunately upon arrival I was extremely disappointed. Many of the fixtures and appliances (including kitchen, fans, lights, air conditioning) were broken or malfunctioning making living conditions very difficult. For the price of this of this listing, I felt that I was completely misled since the property severely underdelivered. For longterm clients, the host enforces a policy where a cleaner must clean the house every two weeks. While this is no issue, what was a problem was the invasion of privacy whereby the cleaners took pictures of my belongings and sent it to the host."
19169,316118943,30/8/18,11621201,Simon,Best location in the city!! Wonderful apartment!! The friendliest host!! I definitely recommend this awesome place!!

The apartment was neat and clean, looked just like the Photo's and totally lived up to all that it stated. Alexis was friendly and the entire process was simple and easy.

The apartment is great - - clean, the master bedroom is amazing (includes great unit to hang & store clothes), the deck is fabulous... the day beds are okay to sleep on too.  Truly a great apartment and location with short walks [5-10 minutes] to Meatpacking, West Village, Chelsea Market and around 20 minute walk to SOHO/Chinatown.  In other words, if you don't want to walk cabs are an inexpensive option or take the metro (station is 1/2 block from your front door)."

19174,96735,14/9/10,173171,Emi,"Alexis was very responsive when we reserved his apartment and answered all of our questions.

The apartment is extremely well located, on the edge of Meatpacking district and West Village.

If there are people sleeping in the living area downstairs, there is noise coming from the street as it's quite a major one and New Yorkers like to honk a lot whilst driving!

Unfortunately we were not able to meet with Alexis personally as he was out of town, but he emailed regularly to ensure we were happy with everything and gave detailed instructions for picking up keys and dropping them off.

I would highly recommend Alexis' apartment, based on the location of the property and Alexis' hospitality and a bargain compared to staying in hotels!

There is traffic noise when sleeping in the lounge area, but guess that is quite common in NYC!  The main bedroom was much quieter.  Alexis was such a great host and he let us leave our suitcases with him until late in the day before our flight that night back to Sydney.  I would definitely recommend his place to any visitors to NYC!"

The apt is clean and well equipped - you'll find everthing you'll need. The location is perfect for exploring the city by walking or you'll find all metro-lines in short walking distance on 14th street. As others have mentioned, the place is not really quiet, but if you love the sound of the city, as we did, this should not bother you at all.

19174,130793,1/11/10,167314,Margaret,"Nice, clean apartment in very convenient location.  The pictures are accurate.

I would caution anyone who has trouble with stairs that this is a fifth floor walk up.  The advantage of being on the fifth floor is a reduction in noise from the street, I slept very comfortably and was not woken up by any noise.

The location of the apartment is very good. Compared to hotel rooms, the place is spacious and the terrace even has a barbecue. Stayed in Nov so we didn't use it, but for the summer time it would be great.
Whenever we had a problem, Alexis replied quickly and was very helpful.
Thanks."
19174,142734,22/11/10,259771,Sarah,"Great apartment, and great location. Very comfortable bed and everything you need was there  -- and although I ended up barely using the wonderful roof terrace, that's definitely a plus.

Alexis was flexible about check-in and check-out, which was wonderful.

Of course a through street will not be entirely quiet, and it is good to be aware that this is actually a fifth-floor walk-up when booking. Neither was a problem for me. 

The apartment had obviously been surface cleaned after the last tenants so it didn't feel directly dirty, but it would have benefited from a more thorough cleaning as there was a layer of dust/grime on the moldings and stains on doors and cabinet doors. "

The stairs up to the apartment are a bit of a hike and it is a bit loud...but I guess that's New York streets for you. There is aircon and wifi in the apartment which are needed when travelling. I stayed with 3 other girls, the bathroom was a bit tight but the rest of the house had enough room. The rooftop balcony is great, especially in summer!

There is a gorgeous outside terrace that overlooks the street and city - sunset bevvies anyone! Love it! Stay here. Also only a few minutes from Bleecker Street for the best shopping and coffee!"
19174,1883067,4/8/12,2525422,Wendy,"Great Location! Great communication with Alexis and fast responses. Love the terrace. 
 "
19174,1917146,7/8/12,2631363,Michele,This place is fantastic. Great spot on the north side of the west village towards Chelsea! The rooftop terrace is an amazing find and we absolutely loved our time there. Alexis was very accommodating because we needed an early check-in and he made this possible for us. The day-beds are very comfortable as is the bed upstairs. I don't have anything bad to say about this place and I hope to be back in the future. 
19174,2118373,27/8/12,3269836,Mark,"This is  beautiful apartment in a great location, and Alexis was an excellent host.  And the amazing roof deck makes it that much better.  Highly recommended on every level. "
19174,2185638,3/9/12,3645,John,"This is a unique space in a great location.  Not noisy at all and great location for PATH train, subway, uptown and downtown access.  Meat packing district is two blocks away, very hip.  Alexis is a great host.  Be sure to be ready for the walk up with your bags.  Shower was great but needs a fix to the water temp.  I am sure the host will take care of that as he seems very responsive.  Terrace is not as big as in pics but awesome nonetheless.  "
19174,2221731,7/9/12,2783409,Jan Willem,"Location could not be better, a stone throw from Meatpacking district and subway to Central Park and Brooklyn right around the corner. The appartment has a fine terrace with BBQ. Communication with Alex went smooth. Higly recommended!"
19174,2535079,8/10/12,2308274,Christine,"Plenty of room and great location. It is next to the station and many great clubs, bars and restaurants. Just be ready to climb up 5 flights of stairs as there is no elevator. It can get very stuffy too, but there are two air cons that work very well. The internet connection is really good too. Also, the hot water takes a while to function and it's New York so there is noise at all hours of the night, be prepared to sleep less and enjoy your stay! :) "
19174,2589383,12/10/12,2931688,Elizabeth,"The apartment is exactly as appears in the photos and was certainly big enough for four of us to stay. The street is quite noisy but the location is very convenient for walking to Chelsea, or Greenwich  village,or union square and excellent subway access. The walk up is hard with bags, but you only have to do that once!  Alexis is prompt at replying to emails and checking and checkout were smooth, however we would have appreciated his fixing all the blown light bulbs."
19174,2646764,18/10/12,2113520,Morten,"We stayed in Alexis flat around the weeks 41/42. Travelling all the ways from Denmark, we was exited if everything was as expected (especially the key exchange).
But I must say that there was absolutely no problem at all - everything went so smooth. The apartment was as expected. The whole Chelsea area is really a nice place, with nearby subways (north and south), a supermarket across the street, as well as a vine store down the street:-)
We will definitely recommend this place as a perfect base for a NY stay."
19174,2758733,30/10/12,1849063,Jenny,"I stayed at Alexis's apartment with three girlfriends for a weekend conference. We had a great time. The apartment was clean and well-maintained. Check-in and check-out were straight-forward. Alexis was professional and friendly--very easy to deal with.

We actually got stuck in NYC in the middle of Hurricane Sandy! We were all supposed to leave on Monday but the airports closed. Since no one else was staying in the apartment, Alexis let us extend our reservation by 2 days until we could fly out. We were so grateful for how easy he made it for us. Otherwise, I'm not sure what we would have done.

14th St is a little noisy. Just be aware that it's a busy street and Fri + Sat nights are loud. This is NYC, after all!

We LOVED the outdoor space and even had a few extra friends over for dinner one night. Such a great addition to the apartment.

The few neighbors we met were all friendly.

We would definitely stay here again!"
19174,2917183,19/11/12,3962474,Peter,great experience. no problems. super friendly host. great place. not noisy
19174,2977821,27/11/12,3459190,David,This is a very good location.  There is a great Italian restaurant just a few doors down and there is a market just a block and a half away that has everything you can imagine.  The apartment is very nice and comfortable. The only negative is the 5 story walk-up.  It is not convenient for anyone who cannot handle stairs.  Luggage was somewhat of a chore. We loved the outside patio!
19174,3039426,8/12/12,3091066,Iñigo,"El apartamento está muy bien, limpio y la situación es inmejorable. Todas las lineas de metro pasan muy cerca, e incluso se puede ir andando a las principales zonas de la ciudad.
"
19174,3095945,16/12/12,3973396,Amaury,"appartement agérable, idéalement situé, en plein coeur de là où tout ce passe en ce moment à NY. nombreux restaurants, bars ou clubs très sympa à proximité. 
des stations de métro de chaque côté de la rue permettent de rayonner facilement dans la ville. 
"
19174,3419102,27/1/13,3141690,Sarah,"Fantastic!  We stayed at Alexis apartment for a little over 5 weeks from late December 2012 through to the end of January 2013, and we throughly loved being able to call his apartment home.  His apartment offers views of NYC, is very secure and has plenty of kitchen utensils to allow for home cooking.  Although the kitchen (bench) space is rather limited, so cooking can be somewhat difficult - but still sufficient.

Alexis was a great host, who responded to all of our email queries very promptly.  The apartment is perfectly located to explore NYC with each of the boroughs only a short walk or subway ride away.  We had no problems at all with noise.  The only thing we would say is that this aparment complex does not have a lift and Alexis' place is on the top floor (5th), so be prepared to walk up and down the stairs each day. But in all honesty this is not an issue.     

But we loved this place and truly did not want to leave.  Based on our experience we would, without any doubt, recommend both Alexis as a host and this apartment."
19174,3565527,18/2/13,4003292,Paulo,"Perfect location, fantastic apartment. We loved our stay here and I'd definitely recommend it!"
19174,3655105,28/2/13,4602926,Michael,Great apartment. Amazing roof. Spacious and clean. Extra large bathroom too. Felt like home.
19174,3690385,4/3/13,446208,Jeremie,We spent a great weekend in NYC. The appartment was perfect and the location is great.
19174,3779221,14/3/13,4252497,Susanne,"The location of Alexis' place is certainly one of the most convenient starting points to discover Manhattan. Meatpacking, Chelsea and the village are at 5 to 10 minutes walking distance and getting to midtown takes only 10 minutes by subway.
The apartment is cosy, arty and well furnished, perfect for a couple.
The terrace must be lovely during spring and summer as it was already very nice covered by snow!
Check in and check out went very easily thanks to Alexis' precise indications and his doorman just next door. 
Only point of improvement: the kind of old equipment such as heating and shower system would deserve a refreshment as well as the towels or the bed linen.
We have nevertheless spent a marvelous week in this apartment and would not hesitate one second renting it again.
"
19174,3852271,21/3/13,4626877,Paul,"Altogether a good stay in Alexis's apartment.
We couldn't enjoy the very nice terrace (it was too cold). The place is not so big so if you are more than 2 you have to be quite good friends,
before I arrive I forget about the stairs (there is no elevator) and it is at the 5th floor.
Otherwise very practical location on 14th street, very close to all subway stops. It is very easy to go anywhere from there.
Alexis's apartment was clean and fonctional."
19174,4018828,3/4/13,1132027,Brandi,"The apartment is super cute, and you really can't beat the location. My only complaint is that there was no hot water in the shower, which wasn't mentioned in the description."
19174,4220947,20/4/13,4868736,Pierrick,"Quel emplacement ! Placé idéalement à Chelsea, ce petit duplex est entre deux métros (trois lignes) et à 5/10 minutes à pied de la High Line, du Chelsea Market, de Broadway et du quartier en plein développement de Meatpacking. Supermarché à proximité, caviste (pour trouver une bonne bouteille de vin), boutiques diverses, Starbuck pour ceux qui veulent y prendre leur petit-déjeuner pas loin... Idéal pour un couple ou avec deux enfants. Wifi nickel. 5e étage sans ascenseur, ce qui est courant pour New York et qui fait un bon échauffement avant de partir découvrir la ville. Appartement bien équipé avec terrasse dont on peut profiter dés les premiers rayons de soleil. Facile à trouver et tout a parfaitement bien fonctionné. Nous le conseillons vivement et nous y retournerons dés que possible tellement NYC est une ville magique ! Pierrick & Maud"
19174,4320254,28/4/13,3191992,Juliano,"It´s a amazing place. Perfect location location, in the middle of all. The Terrace has a great view to enjoy the end of the day. The only incovinient is the stairs. If you plan shopping a lot, like us, thats will be a problem."
19174,15248176,6/7/14,6167532,Karen,"Great Airbnb experience.  Alexis was a wonderful host and quick to answer all emails/ questions.  I would be so lucky if I got to stay here again.
The neighborhood couldn't be any better.  It is exactly where I would want to stay every time I worked in New York.
"
19174,25986624,1/2/15,9383181,Julia,"Alexis war immer erreichbar wenn man ihn brauchte. Es ist alles geregelt und sauber. Die Whg ist gross und perfekt für 1-2 Personen für einen längeren Aufenthalt. Die Küche ist super ausgestattet was für NYC speziell ist. Das Bad ist geräumig und es funktioniert alles. Der Balkon ist riesig und im Summer sehr angenehm und wie ein extra (Website hidden by Airbnb) hat genügend Bettwäsche,Tücher etc. man miss nichts extra kaufen/mitbringen. Wir haben die Zeit sehr genossen. Perfekt ist auch die Subway Anbindung. 1,2,3;4,5,6;L;A,B,C sind direkt vor der Türe. Auch 2 Supermärkte sowie CVS und Duane Read sind praktisch vor derTüre. Das YMCA ist auch in 5min Gehdistanz zu erreichen. "
19174,80311661,17/6/16,32856882,Julia,"We have been extremly happy with our stay in the apartement. Alexis was a very kind, forthcoming and responsible host and took care of all the problems we had during the whole stay. The location of the appartment was perfect, very central and in a very safe area! We can only recommend the appartment it was very cosy and the rooftop and its view are amazing! Nevertheless it was a little bit dusty and the apartement is smaller than it seems, however for 2 ppl it is perfect in terms of size! Thank you Alexis for the great time, and enjoy your stay everyone! "
19174,92151783,7/8/16,20022825,Christian,"Brilliant apartment in a great neighbourhood – so much to do and see around the house even for a veteran NY visitor. The rooftop terrace is an amazing place to start the mornings, and the apartment is very well equipped for even a longer stay. We had plenty of space for three adults, and even the sofa beds are very comfortable for a good night's sleep. Checkin and checkout were very smooth thanks to a doorman in the building next door. Would definitely stay again!"
19174,93935500,14/8/16,13455365,Lizzie,The location was great! And the place was exactly as described. We would definitely stay here again. 
19174,97231333,26/8/16,11586507,Scott,What a great place.  I was there in nice NYC weather and I think I spent more than half of my time out on the terrace.  And I couldn't believe how quiet it was even though it is on 14th Street.  Alexis was a great host answering questions for me during my stay.  It is on the fifth floor but the terrace makes it more than worth it.  I will definitely stay here again.
19282,116501,11/10/10,245225,Michelle,"About the apartment: a gorgeous and really unique studio with room for 2 - 3 people to stay in comfortably. I loved the way she decorated it with bright yellow, vintage pieces and a great book collection. The bed is a little firm, but it didn't bother us. My favorite part was the roof top access - gorgeous for sunrises/ sunsets and a place to just relax! Really roomy and a nice, affordable space to rent. Neighborhood is not the best but it's still safe, plus it's really close to the subway station.

About the experience: Gaia was very nice and answered all messages quickly, which I appreciated. She tried to get us to pay an extra $100 at the end of our stay, which if we didn't damage anything, she would send back after our stay since she could not check us out - which was a downer. She didn't mention it at all in booking the place but thankfully, after meeting her, she didn't make us pay the fee. Overall, Gaia was helpful and welcoming."
19282,121939,18/10/10,240039,Nikki,"So glad I chose to stay here! The apartment was gorgeous, the neighbourhood was lovely and did I mention how fantastic the apartment was?? I wouldn't hesitate to book with Gaia again, she's a truly wonderful individual and you feel it from the good energy she has in her place. Anyone creatively inclined should stay here ;)"
19282,345490,1/7/11,409213,Max,"I stayed at Gaia's apartment for one month and it was a great experience! Gaia was very helpful from the beginning on and stayed in contact with me over the whole time to make sure everything worked out. I travelled by ship and arrived two days earlier than expected, Gaia was so generous to add these days without charging anything.


When I arrived at the apartment everything was super clean, closets were empty, there were towels, bed linen etc. The apartment is really sunny and you have everything you need. The subway is close by, 3 minutes or so,  just a block away. Taking the B or Q train you can be in Manhattan in 20 minutes. 

Gaia clearly put great effort in designing the place, there's lots of great furniture around.

Overall, I can recommend this place to everyone wanting to stay in Brooklyn at a nice place!"
19282,468524,23/8/11,546951,Fabrizio,"Gaïa’s appartment is charming, spacious and very comfy. We spent two fabulous weeks in it. We have met Gaïa’s brother, who has been really kind and helpful. Before the trip, Gaïa sent us some advices to go from the airport to her home. She also explained everything we need to feel like home.
The neigbourhood is quiet and peaceful, the subway station really close to the appartment so we could easily come and go visiting everything we wanted.
We highly recommend Gaïa’s appartment to people who want to visit New-York city and to live the american way of life ! 
"
19282,1812057,27/7/12,1484129,Clémence,"Nous avons séjourné 2 semaines chez Gaia et il n'y a rien a redire !! L'appartement est super, à moins de 5min du métro. Le voisinage est sympa de plus il y a un petit supermarché juste à coté, une pharmacie et un restaurant subway !! Concernant Gaia c'est une hôte très à l’écoute et attentif et gentille ! Elle donne tout ce qui est nécessaire pour pouvoir passé un bon séjour. C'est son frère qui nous a accueilli et il est très gentille. Je ne peut que vous la conseillé !!"
19282,1865915,1/8/12,3046182,Thomas,"We stayed for two nights at Gaia's lovely, spacious and sunny apartment.  The subway station & Prospect Park are a block away.  We would definitely do it again.  "
19282,4761355,24/5/13,480497,Cristian,"We spent one week at Gaia's apartment. We went to NYC for work, and found her apartment to be the perfect place for us. It is very spacious and clean, it felt like an oasis in the middle of NY. 
The express Q train is 3 minutes from her house and commuting to Manhattan was super easy and convinient. I deffenitely recommend her apartment and I look forward to staying there again next time we will be in NYC."
19282,4966560,4/6/13,5024431,Bonnie,Apartment was in a very good location - close to subway.  A very good host.  Apartment has lots of sunshine with all the windows and was very  roomy.  It is kind of warm with all the sunshine coming in on the hot days of summer.  I would guess in the spring and fall the sunshine would be great!  Make sure you ask for the House Manual up front before you book.  This will tell you all you need to know about the cooling of the apartment.  There were 6 of us and it was unusually very hot in New York during our stay.  We were there 29 May - 3 Jun.  We did keep the air conditioners on Energy efficient but it was not that cool for us.  Maybe if the heat doesn't bother you it would be fine.  We had a great trip!
19282,5829878,18/7/13,6874731,Craig,"Gaia's place was great. Her Mom was very helpful getting us in and out for our stay. The apartment was well stocked with towels, and various things we needed. Was very clean and well kept. The hammock in the living room was a big hit with our teenage boy. Our younger son enjoyed cleaning up with the broom. The area was real nice, with easy walking to two different subway stations as well as Prospect Park, groceries, drug store, restaurants. Great stay!"
19282,290012820,13/7/18,123507697,Kevin,Great apartment in a convenient location and would definitely stay there again.
19282,293571957,20/7/18,201431034,Marshall,"I can't really compare it to an apartment in New York, it is the only time we have been there. Older building and utilities. Books plentiful. Decent space (I think big for New York). It is not a hotel, but for a decent price it worked. Extremely close to transportation. "
19282,299810865,31/7/18,37954888,Rebekka,"Our stay at Gaia's place was wonderful.  Initially, we picked it for it's proximity to the park, the subway, and the culturally diverse neighborhood. We got so much more than we bargained for, however. Gaia's place was serene, sweet, and full of good energy. It felt like a second home and we were sad to leave.  I'm originally from Germany, have traveled extensively, and carry many of those experiences wherever I go. Being in Gaia's place reminded me of where I have been and where I still wish to go. I realize this is a bit of a poetic review, but I wanted to communicate how much my sons and I enjoyed our stay. Thanks again!"
19319,39614,2/5/10,76599,Eve,"Ana was very friendly and warm and her apt was clean, comfortable and easy. I really enjoyed my stay at her Lower East Side apt.  I highly recommend staying at Ana's!"

This was my first airbnb experience and I'm very happy with my stay at their place.  Their apartment was indeed clean and the room spacious and comfortable.  The air conditioning was great too, in the middle of a NY heat wave!

19319,68576,25/7/10,122623,Alvin,"Ana's place had a great view, an easy walk to the subway, and a really good pizza place nearby (Frank and Toms). Ana and Kathie were great hosts with a lot of information. I was given access to their internet and a map of Manhattan. 2 of the most important and useful things in my trip. My only regret is not spending more time with her. If I'm ever in the area again I'd definitely stay with her again (if she lets me of course!)"
19319,74935,7/8/10,154540,Felicia,"Ana is a very friendly host and is very responsive to my inquiries. Her place is at a great location, which is at the eastern part of lower Manhattan and is easily accessible to the places of interest if you are in NY for holiday.

19319,114734,9/10/10,204720,Tanya,"Ana was a great hostess. She gave us great directions to her home, was waiting for us when we arrived. She gave us great information about the city, where to eat, where to go out and had lots of maps and books for us to look at. Ana was also very sweet and let us use her kitchen to make food and allowed me to use her computer whenever I needed it. The apartment has a great location - very close to downtown, Brooklyn (the bridge is very nice to walk across), the river walk on the west of Manhattan, the financial district, etc. etc. It is walking distance from the metro, and I felt very safe at night too! There is also a bike rental shop very close to her place which I would suggest to anyone!
I would stay with Ana again if I came to NYC and I will definitely suggest her place to any of my friends if they go. Thank you again Ana! You are always welcome to stay with me if you ever come to Tennessee!! :) Thanks for everything - you were very sweet with us. Antonio and I enjoyed our stay very much. Wish we could have seen you more! "

Ana thanks for everything ! 
"
19319,118098,13/10/10,117376,Sue,"Ana was very considerate in meeting us at the apartment upon our arrival.  She had several suggestions and maps that were available to us and suggestions on where to eat nearby.  Her recommendation on taxi service was also helpful especially upon our departure so that we could order the night before.  Although my friend was aware of the traffic outside, it didn't bother me at all.  I would suggest that if you are staying with a friend (other than a spouse or partner) be sure to book the queen room.  The room and bath were very clean and she was kind about offering the use of her kitchen.  All in all is was a pleasant experience."

There were some days when they were out late but when they were home they were really friendly and fun to hang out with.  Overall the bedroom and also entire apartment is quiet, clean, and really comfortable.

The neighborhood is close to a lot of stuff -- Chinatown, Little Italy and the Lower East Side.  The apartment is also close the F train so you can get to just about anywhere in Manhattan and to Brooklyn quite easily.

Overall highly recommended.  I'd definitely recommend this apartment to friends."

We got our own key and could come and go as we liked. The bedroom was perfect, with perfect view!! Kitchen and bathroom was very clean and tidy, and we could make our own food if we wanted to. We could also use the rest of the apartment as we liked. We got a lot of nice tips regarding where to eat and where to go, and all the places were great! We really recommend this great apt, great location and great girls!
Thank you Ana and Kathie!"

19319,333874,25/6/11,697409,Rachel,I had a great stay at Ana and Kathie's lovely apartment in the lower east side. The room is clean as well as the rest of the apartment. I had access to everything I needed. I had to shorten my stay due to some unexpected traveling issues. They we very kind about alterations I had to make to my reservation. The view is also lovely just like you see in the pictures. This was my first airbnb experience and it will not be my last. I would love to book with Kathie and Ana  again in my future trips to NY. I felt very comfortable throughout this experience. All in all Great host ! :)
19319,557425,22/9/11,53,Peter,"This home is a real gem in NYC - absolutely stunning. I've lived in Manhattan for 9 years, so I have to say to anyone visiting, this is about as perfect a way to do the island as you can imagine. Spectacular views from the rooms and balcony, a beautiful home, and steps away from the F train. There's some road noise, but on the eighth floor it's quite manageable. And Ana and her roommate Kathy were wonderful, absolutely flexible and friendly and the ideal airbnb hosts."
19319,573096,27/9/11,357588,Jean-Pierre,"The stay at Ana and Kathie's place was excellent and we highly recommend their place to anyone who likes to visit NYC!
Ana and Kathie's place is big enough not to get in each others way, but if you need anything (advice, tips, etc) they are always there to support you.
The apartment is clean and the room is simply brilliant! It is big, has a great bed and you will have the best view of both the Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge right out of your bedroom window.
Especially in the morning, with the rising sun, the views are stunning.
The walk to the East Broadway stop on the F-line takes about 3 minutes and takes you to midtown in about 15 minutes.
If you need to go anywhere else you can switch trains on a number of stations easily."
19319,606236,7/10/11,1111262,Raymond,"This is as good as it gets!  This is my first experience with the airbnb.com community.  I have been blown away by the quality of the service and level of communication from both the administrative side and by my hostess, Ana. Ana and Kathie were both very responsive to my emails before my arrival to NY.  We arrived early before they got off work, but Ana got her girlfriend to come over to open the door for us. Their apartment is in a secured building located in a safe neighborhood with a great view of the waterfront and bridges.  The room was comfortable with a/c. Their location is so convenient to getting around Manhattan either by subway or walking.
Ana is a great person. She loves sharing her favorite places and eating hang-outs.  She had very good non-touristy recommendations.  She always was available to us if any questions or issues arose.  Don’t ever hesitate to rent from Ana and Kathie!  If I am in NY again, I would do it again in a heartbeat!
Even the airbnb.com administrative contacts were great.  I had a billing issue that I called in the middle of the evening and they had someone resolve it immediately!  That’s impressive!
"
19319,662400,25/10/11,976325,Marie,"We had a great stay at Ana and Kathy's place.  They were both really nice to talk to, and were very helpful in answering all of our questions.  
The room is really big, and could easily fit two persons and has a great view. We were free to use the kitchen supplies and the fridge during our stay, which we often did. The apartment is located near a subway station which will take you where ever you need to go when you visit NY. 
We would definitely stay there again :-) "
19319,695131,6/11/11,774955,Raul," I stayed one week with my girlfriend at Ana and Kathie's and it was absolutely brilliant!


Ana and Kathie were really kind and they are the best hostess that we've ever met. The appartment was really cossy and very clean. It is really close to the subway and the views from the balcony are amazing. We recommend to walk from the apartment to the Pier 17, the views of Brooklyn are fantastic. And don't hesitate to ask them to recommend you a place to eat or places to visit, they are really helpful!!!

We felt like at home, and if we go back to NY (we will for sure!) we will stay there again!

Muchas gracias por todo chicas!"
19319,756819,1/12/11,632121,Carmel,"We had THE BEST TIME in NY and and we very much enjoyed staying with Ana and Kathie. We had 18 fantastic days and they were wonderful hosts who made us so welcome and comfortable. They were always willing to answer our many questions about New York. Their home is very clean and the room is spacious and the view was spectacular, especially at sunset. It is very close to the subway and we would uptown in no time. We loved the easy access to Brooklyn. We also really enjoyed staying in the neighbourhood. We felt if we had stayed in a hotel in midtown, we would not have had the experience of viewing life on the LES. We have already recommended them to people back home and will continue to do so any chance we get. We would love to stay in their apartment again, in fact we wish we were still there!  We just loved it and honestly wouldn't have changed a thing. Thanks girls for everything."

It was very straightforward communicating with her at every step of the airbnb process.  The wifi connection was super-fast and there were no issues with heating/cooling – two things I super-appreciate after having issues at other places.  In a great neighborhood and very close and convenient to subways to get to wherever you need to go in NYC.

I stayed at Ana and Kathie´s for 6 weeks. And i would be happy to stay longer:)
The communication with them from the beginning was really good - they were clear and made me feel safe and welcome. I did not have many questions, because Ana and Kathie were always ahead of me giving me info on how to find the building and how to orientate myself. And they continued being great all through my stay:) 
The apartment is clean and just like the pictures. Ana and Kathie are really nice, warm, easy going, clean and respectful people. 
The building itself is in a very nice area - overlooking the bridges.( And the doormen are really nice to)
The place is really close to everything and the Metro station. In a safe and calm area.
I will come back to Ana and Kathie if i go back to NY, and i warmly reccomend them as hosts!!"

19319,2243813,9/9/12,1154778,Zarina,"Ana was an absolutely great host.  She made it easy for me to get the keys to the apartment after my flight arrived in New York.  I stayed her apartment for 5 days.  She provided me with a clean and spacious room for New York standards.  I really appreciated the fact that the building had several elevators ( I did not want to walk up multiple flights of stairs with all my luggage) and the room had an air conditioning.  The apartment was also very close to the subway (about a 5 min walk.)

I was traveling alone and Ana was kind enough to invite me along with her and her friends to walk around DUMBO and Williamsburg and I joined them for lunch.  She made me feel very comfortable and was extremely warm and kind.  I enjoined getting to know her and her friends.  

I would highly recommend staying with them anytime and would do so again in a heartbeat if I were back in New York again.

19319,2321498,17/9/12,3456041,Michael,"Hello everyone. I stayed at Ana's place at NYC and had a great time. Everything worked out perfect and the rom was big and clean. The only not so good thing is, that it is sometimes at night kind of loud because the FDR is passing right besides the house. "

She makes you feel welcome and comfortable from the beginning and she is very responsive to all mails and questions you have. Everything said in all these positive reviews are just true and the room is exactly as advertised. No need to say more. 
19319,2531156,7/10/12,3369827,Alex,"These girls are best! Stop looking if you plan to stay near the downtown.

The view is definitely spectacular, bridges is the first thing you see in the morning. The building is on the FDR, a little down from the Chinatown. 15 minutes up will bring you to the Little Italy, another 15 minutes up and right and you'll be in the East Village with its cafes and atmosphere.

Metro station is two blocks away, F line goes straight to Empire State Building and Central Park. Everything is pretty accessible.

The only drawback is that the place a little bit noisy in the night due to cars passing on the road, so if you're looking for a quiet park experience, you won't find it. But this is NY, and we were quite comfortable with it.

Don't forget to feed squirrels near the building."
19319,2739243,28/10/12,3761804,Ignacio,"Ha sido una muy grata experiencia el alojarnos durante nuestra estadia en NY en lo de Ana y Kathie.

La vista es espectacular desde la ventana pudiendo ver el rio, los puentes de Brooklin, Manhattan y Williamsburg.

Both Ana and her roommate Kathie made me feel right at home, and any apprehension I had quickly disappearred.  Both made me feel welcome and I felt very comfortable, talking or even watching TV with them.  They also acted as great tour guides directing me to the right subways, giving me excellent directions and providing me with the phone number to a car service.  The apartment was very clean and my accommodations were very comfortable.  I couldn't have had a better vacation.  Looking forward to doing it again.        "

I made this booking at the last minute and as soon as my request was accepted Ana was in constant contact with me and was easy to reach whenever I had any questions to ask. The whole apartment was very clean with a lot of light and even has a balcony which you can just sit back and enjoy the view. The bedroom was big enough to accommodate my things and the bed itself was very comfortable and you also get a great view of the Manhattan Bridge from your window. The nearest subway station was 2 blocks away and was very easy to get to. I considered the surrounding neighbourhood to be very safe also.

Las fotos publicadas describen muy bien el departamento, la pieza, baño y lugares comunes perfectos, todo muy limpio.

El departamento es muy comodo, la cama amplia, con una vista privilegiada del puente Manhattan y el rio. El barrio es muy tranquilo y  familiar, volviamos tarde por la noche sin problemas, los bares de East Village estan cerca, ademas la estacion del subte f queda a pocas cuadras y recorre toda la ciudad. Tanto Ana como Kathie estaban poco en la casa, nos moviamos con mucha independencia, hay varios lugares cerca para comer y un mercado muy completo en la esquina.

Me senti em casa o tempo todo tanto no quarto, quanto na sala, na cozinha e na varanda que é maravilhosa, com uma vista lindíssima. Elas ficam pouco em casa e, quando estão, oferecem prioridade ao hóspede. A localização é perfeita, com comércio barato no entorno e a poucas quadras de excelentes restaurantes e museus de ny. O metrô é muito perto e pode-se fazer tudo a pé. O Brooklyn é logo ali, do outro lado da ponte que se pode ver da janela. Definitivamente ficaria no apartamento de novo.

Well, let me describe my experience...
My business partner picked me up at the airport and we headed to Ana's place, getting there Ana was waiting for me, she is a beautiful sweet girl, wanted to help me with my heavy luggage (of course I didn't let her help), she show me the room where I would stay for 5 days and 4 nights. The apartment is cozy, clean and the shower is wonderful, actually is more a water massage than a shower, due to the water pressure. The apartment's view is amazing, I woke up in the morning with the view of Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges and the sunset shining bright, simply awesome. I also had the opportunity to meet Ana's Dad, an experienced gentleman with vast culture, both of us spoke Portuguese (my native language) and Spanish. The best thing was to exchange life experiences, with nice and educated people.
I definitely recommend staying at Ana's place. Thank you Ana and Kathie for a memorable experience. God bless you girls!"

The apartment was super warm during the winter, had a very functional kitchen and laundry in the building (which we all know is a luxury in New York!)

She was kind, welcoming, and even allowed us an early check-in because we had an early arrival into Newark. I appreciated her recommendations to visit certain spots. She was always happy to answer any questions regarding transportation and different neighborhoods.

The apartment was very clean and the bed was comfy. The view of the two bridges was spectacular and great to wake up to before heading out.

View from balcony (yes there's a balcony) was absolutely breath taking. Location is near Deli variety stores, as well as the best restaurant meal we had (thanks to Kathy & Anna's recommendations). We were comfortable using washroom, kitchen, and dining area. Hosts were easily reachable through (Hidden by Airbnb) or Airbnb, which is especially convenient because we did not have US Cell phones lines, but could still reach them through street Wifi. Hosts were typically working or out, so gave us more privacy than we expected given it was shared apartment. But we had our room anyway. Location was near subway, but we realized that anywhere in Manhattan was. The neighborhood was not posh by any means, and the people on the streets were nice and we felt safe walking at night at any time."

Ana en Kathie zijn super aardig en maken graag een praatje. Alles was netjes. I raad de plek zeker aan!"
19319,205258877,21/10/17,131480805,Merima,"I stayed at Ana and Kathies apartment for three months. I can highly recommend this place especially for longer stays because you'll feel like staying at home. Ana and Kathie were always friendly and answered me all my questions. They are probably the best Airbnb hosts in New York.
The apartement was always clean. The room is very huge related to the standards in New York and the bed is very comfy and soft.
The Lower East Side is one of the best neighborhoods in Manhattan and I always felt safe there. 
I would choose Ana and Kathies Airbnb again."
19319,206912110,27/10/17,20016420,Mario,"老实说房间外面有一条快速路，即使关上窗户也还是有点点噪音，如果是睡眠不好的人可能会有影响，但是对于我来讲完全不是问题。而且我很喜欢Ana和她的朋友，她们真是非常棒的房东！跟她们聊天很开心，她们也非常认真地跟我介绍厨房里的东西怎么用，还专门为我洗了个热水壶出来烧热水喝，哈哈。Ana推荐的餐馆也很好，带我走捷径过去。告诉我附近的便利店在哪里。晚上我要出去跑步，还专门推荐我去附近的Williamsburg Bridge跑，说那里跑步的人多，灯光明亮，感觉真的很好。
Ana家附近地铁步行大概6-7分钟可以到，去地铁的路上就会路过大小超市便利店，我总是顺便买个泡面回家，哈哈。总之地理位置对我而言很棒，去South Ferry很近，去布鲁克林也方便。
我很喜欢房间的布置，面积并不小哦，床也很舒服，卫生间超级干净。啊。。。。总之，在曼哈顿选择住Ana家很棒，我还愿意去，一起喝咖啡，蹭煎饺子吃，跟她们再聊聊天。"
19319,220067274,20/12/17,21219838,Zoe,"I stayed here for 2 months and found it a fantastic place to base my stay in New York.  Great location near good restaurants, bars, stores and excellent transport connections.  The apartment is well fitted out and the room is spacious and has fantastic views (as does the living room and balcony).  Ana and Kathie are lovely (Hidden by Airbnb) , always friendly and on hand with tips for exploring the city, but as a longer term stay it also felt like you had your own space.  Superb place to stay!"

19601,702297,8/11/11,180056,David,"If you are a family with kids this is the prefect place to stay.  The master suite feels like you are in a stylish hotel.  Elegant and beautifully designed.  As if you left the kids at home and are taking a romantic getaway.  But downstairs there are two bedrooms surrounding a large playroom filled with every toy and instrument you could imagine.  Maggie even brought out age appropriate toys in anticipation of our arrival with a three year old.  So that saves you a whole suitcase from home.  Large, luxurious, great design and Maggie was a phone call away to handle any of the houses quirks.  Like a door that wouldn't open (there are two separate entrances - so not a big deal).  Or an alarm that wasn't connected to anything.  Maggie took care of everything. I highly recommend staying here.  You'll be glad you did.  "
19601,779150,12/12/11,826954,New,"Our stay could not have been nicer! The house is welcoming and comfortable. We felt right at home. The host was very helpful and easy to communicate with. The location is ideal for Brooklyn: A step in either direction to get to Dumbo or Carroll Gardens, and so easy to get to lower Manhattan. Highly recommended. "
19601,1100538,9/4/12,644458,Francie,"Maggie's place was by far the most spacious, homey and yet somehow also the most elegant and distinctive place our family has stayed in in NYC. We take our NYC family trips seriously and do them often, almost always staying in Maggie's Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. Maggie's house was super convenient and she was incredibly generous and communicative as a host. "
19601,3193143,31/12/12,478789,Sally,"Maggie's appartment is extremely spacious and conveniently located. As listed it is ideal for a family. The subway is just round the corner and it's one stop to Wall Street. Everyday we had a great breakfast in the diner opposite the subway which set us up for the whole day. The Japanese Restaurant Iron Chef House , a real gem was also just round the corner. 
we did not meet Maggie but she left full instructions and e-mailed us while we were there. 
Upstairs was a little cold (we stayed at Christmas) but we had been told in advance and came prepared. "
19601,7004743,3/9/13,474724,Natalie,"Maggie has a beautiful, spacious apartment filled with great art and furniture.  Really beautiful decor!  And, the apartment couldn't be in a better location- I am certain anyone visiting New York will enjoy all the great neighborhood amenities (restaurants, bars, beautiful parks)  and close proximity to Manhattan.  Maggie knows the area intimately and can give great travel tips to get the most out of your stay.  This would be a perfect holiday location to really soak in all that Brooklyn and all of New York has to offer!   "
19601,9460978,30/12/13,5085851,Lynne,"Our stay in Maggie's apartment was great.  The apartment is in a great neighborhood in Brooklyn and is very close to Manhattan with all major subway stops around.  You do feel like you are in a house and there is plenty of room for a family.   There are loads of games for kids so our two were well entertained while staying there.  The apartment is very nice and super quiet, I would recommend it to others looking for a lot of space which is hard to find.   Great master bathroom with a rain shower and huge washer and dryer.  Maggie was really easy and nice to deal with, and made herself available despite being on holiday herself.  "

Our group of 7 had plenty of room to sleep and gather, and the locale cannot be beat.  Good small outdoor space, and easy walking to almost any subway line you'd want."

19601,18192239,23/8/14,19196882,Michel,"As firt time users of Airbnb, Maggie was very patient with us, she gave us accurate & clear instructions.  

The duplex is very well located in Brooklyn Heights, close to several subway stations.  Also nearby, you can walk to grocery stores, pharmacy, wine store, very convenient...we also walked down the Brooklyn Bridge, this is a must if you stay at Maggie's...

The duplex was very spacious for our party of 5, it has a very nice master bedroom with in-suite bathroom on the upper level.  Nice living room with a large dining area, we used only the kitchen area for breakfast, another good asset for this apartment!  The two other rooms located on the lower level were kind a small but ok for the kids.

I was concerned with parking in this area but I easily found a 25$ per day parking for the minivan on Livingston St., less than 15 minutes walk from the duplex...

We wanted to live like locals in the NYC area, we got what we wanted...thanks Maggie !"

Maggie is a wonderful hostess--responsive and flexible--and we really enjoyed the apartment's cosy, artsy, family-friendly vibe. We also had great fun studying the photo collages in the kitchen and office--full of surprises! Highly recommended. "
19601,48808929,28/9/15,44385089,Thomas,This place was amazing. My friends and I did not expect the apartment to be so spacious and well furnished. We had a great time and would definitely recommend this location! 
19601,50472928,12/10/15,1658570,Katherine,"What a beautiful home in a great location of Brooklyn Heights! The pictures really don't do the place justice — incredible art and furnishing, tons of space, and one of the most beautiful blocks in the neighborhood. Great communication with Maggie in the days leading up to our stay. My bridesmaids and I got ready for my wedding here, and it couldn't have been better. Highly recommended!"
19601,51316065,19/10/15,874005,Wilneida,"Maggie was very thoughtful host.  She made sure everything was prepared to our needs before our arrival.  The apartment and neighborhood are so comfortable, cozy, and so large and spacious for NYC standards.  The neighborhood is everything you would want from your NYC experience, close to transport, shops, restaurants, amazing walks, museums, etc.  Maggie's place will be the place we turn to whenever we come to NYC again.  "
19601,52127173,26/10/15,46024084,Raymond,"Great stay; we felt like prosperous Brooklyn Heights denizens for two days. Wonderful location. We walked and biked to explore Brooklyn Heights, Dumbo, and Vinegar Hill with a bike ride for a touch of Gowanus and its uber Whole Foods. Apartment is big, tall ceilinged, and comfortable. We cooked one night; great Viking range. With all its personal effects around, it definitely felt like parchuting into another family's life. Be vigilant when unloading; we managed to get a $60 ticket."
19601,57892512,30/12/15,21054752,Kathryn,Maggie made us feel very welcome. She sent informative emails before our visit and checked up on us while we were there. The apartment was clean and equipped with everything we needed.  
19601,75439695,21/5/16,5518444,Maria,"Maggie's place is really beautiful and the neighborhood was very conveniently located since we were attending a conference in Dumbo. One thing to keep in mind is that the check-in and check-out times are strict so plan ahead, we had a long over night flight so Maggie was kind enough to let us drop off our luggage and we tried to do the best of our time while we could finally check in and feel like humans again. For the rest, the place was clean, a little bit chilly for the time of the year but overall it was a good experience."
19601,91324998,4/8/16,67637426,Ayalah,"We were so fortunate to get to stay in this Airbnb rental. Maggie's apartment was perfect for our family of 6, 2 adults and 4 kids. It is comfortable and beautifully decorated. A real pleasure to stay in. It is also extremely well situated with multiple train lines, supermarkets and playgrounds within easy walking distance. Maggie was so helpful and reassuring while we were planning our trip. Everything was exactly as she had described it. Once we arrived she checked in with us many times. Thank you to Maggie for giving us a super time in NY. "

19812,31180,24/3/10,75771,Verena,Cute small apartment in top location! The area is amazing - lots of cafés and nice little shops. We also felt very safe. The apartment is individually furnished and we enjoyed all the little arty details! Our bed was comfortable and we had everything we needed although it could have been a little bit cleaner. We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to our friends.

19812,32944,3/4/10,85199,Adrienne,"Starlee's darling apartment is exactly as described, only just a little bit more so.  It is even more sunny; the kitchen and living room are just a little more roomier; and the neighborhood is even more fantastic.  As the reviews of Starlee share, she is responsive and helpful.  Would def stay here again! "
19812,36298,18/4/10,51596,Jessica,"We had a lovely time staying at Starlee's apartment. We felt very safe and the apartment is light and the living areas spacious. 

Williamsburg is very cool and we had no shortage of great places to eat and 24/7 supermarkets etc. The subway is very close and is it probably quicker to get into the centre of Manhattan from Bedford Av than places way up town. 

Starless was a pleasure to deal with and always quick to respond. We would recommend her apartment to friends and would love to come back! "
19812,38288,26/4/10,62880,Lucinda,"Starlee's place is HUGE. Way too much space for me and my husband. We didn't know what to do with it all. The bed was extremely comfy. The location was prime and allowed us to do all the things we wanted to do in NY, without any problems. The area has many great boutiques to enjoy from vintage clothing spots to a cheese monger! I was very pleased to find that gem with delicious bries, just baked breads, pickled veggies, and tasty home-made local jams and jellies. Starlee made it easy for us too. If there was anything that needed a fixin', it was the sloped floors, they made me a little dizzy. But other than that, it felt like home. Thanks Starlee. "
19812,39678,3/5/10,88411,Hannah,"We had a great time staying at Starlee's place! We found the apartment spacious, sunny and really quiet - simply a lovely place to be! The bed was really comfortable and we felt really at home! The only thing was it could have done with a bit of a clean - especially the bath tub, but other than that it was fine! We though that the area was fabulous - loads of great shops, cafes and bars nearby and it is really close to the subway so quick to get into the city! Thanks Starlee! We would certainly think about staying the next time we come to NYC!"
19812,49438,3/6/10,118729,Rhiana,"We couldn't have asked for a better location... 5 - 10 min walk to the L Train, Bedford Ave and only a 45 min walk over the Williamsburg bridge to Manhattan. The neighbourhood is very safe, buzzing with activity, yet quiet enough to sleep undisturbed. Natural light illuminates the apartment and it's much bigger than the photos illustrate. Thanks again."
19812,71530,31/7/10,155555,Lorna,"Starlee's place was amazing! Great location, clean, cute and comfortable. Highly recommend u stay here. Starlee was really helpful in giving advice on the local area and Manhattan. Great intro to NYC!"
19812,81737,20/8/10,172439,Hajar,"Starlee's place was lovely with character and personality. Though a bit dusty, it was comfortable, with a kitchen that was well-equipped and airy, a living room that was big and cosy, and a bedroom, though small, had the most comfortable double bed I had ever slept in. 

Starlee was most accommodating as well as I was having trouble finding a place to stay for some of the days I was in NYC. The location of the flat couldn't be more perfect, just a few minutes away from happening Bedford ave in Williamsburg and a short walk to the subway, which gets you into Manhattan in less than 10 mins. It was a lovely place.

19812,85426,27/8/10,162184,Matilda,Great location and cozy appartment - would really recommend other people staying there. Allthoug the appartment could have needed some cleaning.

19812,115290,10/10/10,18518973,Anthony,"Starlee's apartment was very comfortable, we felt right at home. The location is amazing, the neighborhood has lots of great restaurants and bars. It was very quiet at night and lots of sunshine in the morning. I would most definitely consider staying again. The only drawback was that I was unable to contact starlee about picking up keys until the day before, however it was all sorted out quickly, and there were no other issues. It is a very pleasant place to stay and I would recommend this to all my friends. Thank you starlee!"
19812,138473,14/11/10,253986,Chris,"Starlee's apartment is great and in a really good location in heart of the action in Williamsburg. It has its own individuality and is a really good place to hang out, before exploring the neat shops, cafes and bars which are all on the doorstep.  only met Starlee briefly but she was really helpful, as was an email that she sent before my stay telling me where everything was. All in all I would say that there isn't a better place that you could stay in New York, this place is definitely recommended!"
19812,154189,15/12/10,267013,Katrine,"We had a great time staying at Starlees' place. The apartment is located super great. But there were, a few downsides, the place was so dirty. There weren’t any clean bed sheets, only the ones the people who stayed before us had used. That is a bit disgusting when we where told there would be clean ones ready.  We also had a mouse visiting.  The internet bill was not paid, so it did not work, which was really annoying. It was a bit difficult getting Starlee to answer the emails we send her. All in all, the location is great and the apartment is nice, but it really needed a clean up, and when you are on vacation and pay 100 dollars per night you don’t really feel like cleaning up for other people. "
19812,333642,25/6/11,294085,Barry,"Starlee's place is authentic NY living, amazing location at the intersection of three awesome Brooklyn ""vibes"" and a turn of the century floor-through at that. When a small complication came up during my stay, Starlee was right on top of things. This is NOT a hotel, but if you're into that and a fan of a certain kind NY living, this place is spot-on. "
19812,495280,2/9/11,857691,Chase,"Great apartment in an a perfect location.

19812,628636,14/10/11,1218070,Tim,"Wonderfully central location in Williamsburg.  Near everything, subway is 5 minutes away with Mahattan just another 5 after that. I actually spent more nights in Williamsburg then I did in Manhattan because I loved the spirit of the location so much. This is an old apartment and so it was a little dusty, but still I felt very much at home quite quickly. Also, bed is comfy!

Starlee was very accommodating when I locked myself out and was so friendly about the whole thing, it really made my day.

My sole complaint would be that communication with Starlee was a little bit slow. But in the end everything was taken care of and I really enjoyed my week in NYC!"
19812,648449,20/10/11,172574,Valerio,Nice and cozy apartment in a good position in Williamsburg. Quiet at night and very close to all the main attractions of the area. 5/10 mins by walk from metro stations.

19812,962688,1/3/12,1548604,Moya,Great location! really bright and cheerful place especially with the cold winter outside. Starlee was there to welcome us after a long journey. I would stay there again in a heart beat.

The bed is very comfy!!!  So is the couch in the living room. A lot of space. By the way there is a lot of great books in the apartment. So if you like to read before going to sleep you will have amazing choice:) If I'm in NYC I will definitely try to book this apt again!

19812,2865651,12/11/12,3419162,Florian,"The flat was really nice and the neighborhood is really cool but a few things bowerred us during or before our stay and as we paid 39€ for cleaning we thought it was important to say these things :

- Before coming Starlee was difficult to reach and took 2 weeks to respond to our emails.
- the floor was really unclean with dog hair, we hoovered the place ourself, the towels she gave us were completely wet, the bathroom carpet was really dirty. There was no room for our clothes or stuff so we had to put them on the dirty floor.
- as told, we went to a bar down the street to get the keys when we arrived. Back at the apartment the keys would'nt open the door so we went back to the bar again (still with our luggages) and we had to call her to discover that she was in the apartment and there was no interphone for us to find out."
19812,3675695,3/3/13,5957,Rachel,"From the very beginning it was easy to reach Starlee and she made it very easy for me to get the keys. I was so happy for the strong wi-fi and Starlee left me some room to hang things in the closet. She checked on me upon my arrival and wanted me to have a great stay. I knew by reading the reviews to expect dirty floors and yes, they were really dusty but since I was there for a month I swept them. She washes some things at home so since the towels are air-dried they come out stiff. I used them, knowing they are clean but then eventually just visited the Laundromat. The building is really old, and the bedroom at this time of year (Feb) was really drafty, but Starlee provides a nice, safe Vornado space heater to use and it keeps the room warm. The rest of the apt is very comfortable, only the bedroom was cold on the nights it was below freezing. I would definitely stay at Starlee’s again because it is just so convenient to get to Manhattan, I really found some great restaurants in Williamsburg, and I got so addicted to all the great coffee within walking distance."
19812,3724447,8/3/13,4823257,Lawrence,"Great spot, amazing food and shopping within 5 minute walk. Easy pick up of keys. Had a couple of issues with the WiFi but nothing major, if all else fails you can use the coffee shop wifi which which reaches the apartment. Fairly easy to get to Manhattan! All in all my girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay. "
19812,3775714,13/3/13,2190721,Aidan,"Great place and great host - very comfortable and clean without being sterile. Some towels were damp when we got there, but clean - not a big deal. Good light, amazing location, and still not noisy in the bedroom. What more could you want?"

And all the bars and restaurants of Williamsburg just a few minutes away. Starlee was away so we never met her, but she made sure that all the arrangements for our arrival was in place. We had the whole apartment to ourselves, and had a great stay."
19812,10639700,1/3/14,10363837,Pierre-Yves,"Stayed a week at Starlee's. Great apartment, very convenient, close to the L train and the shops you'd need in this situation.
Very bright, colorful, really makes you feel welcome. We had largely enough space for two people.

We didn't meet Starlee in person, but the check-in and check-out were nevertheless quite easy, and she still was very helpful about the place.

Highly recommended."
19812,16791209,2/8/14,1136141,Matt,"Starlee was an awesome host and her place was really awesome. It's an amazing location, and it's decorated really well.

It was super easy getting keys and organizing when to check in and heck out. She's super responsive. "

Starlee was very responsive to any question I had and gave good recommendations for things to do.

The internet went out when we first arrived, but Starlee was quick to get the issue resolved and there were no more issues with the internet the rest of the week."
19812,19242628,8/9/14,394961,Justus,Starlee went above and beyond to work with my short notice.  She really made me feel welcome in her place which made the stay excellent.  I would highly recommend this apartment if you are looking for a laid back experience in Williamsburg.
19812,19438062,12/9/14,675590,Aaron,Starlee's place was in a perfect location in Williamsburg and even more spacious than the photos lead you to believe. I would recommend a stay here and I hope to return.

Set in the heart of Williamsburg I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Starlee's and couldn't have wished for a better and more convenient location! 
I will surely be returning to this adorable property when I next visit New York and thoroughly recommend to anyone else! "
19812,91065999,3/8/16,79959865,Robert,"Starlee's appartment is in an excellent location in Williamsburg, a neighbourhood which is on the Top 15 sightseeing list in the Lonely Planet. The appartment is cute and very comfortable. Starlee cares a lot about her guests and patiently answers all the questions ;-) I would definitely recommend to stay at that place!"

19812,96363879,22/8/16,77182006,Song,"The host was friendly and efficient.  The location was perfect. The apartment was spacious, but the bedroom snug.  The photos are pretty much accurate.  The place is quirky and old, kinda like Brooklyn.  If you're staying on a budget and doing a quick visit, this place will do the job."
19812,101265437,12/9/16,11345138,Lisa,The most ideal location! Starlee's space was cozy and had everything we needed. Close to several subway stations. Starlee was flexible and a very accommodating host!

19812,140040801,27/3/17,48315498,Matteo,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Starlee's for one week and we loved the place, especially the area. Williamsburg is such an amazing neighbourhood! The apartment has a really cool interior and had all we needed (we only had a few problems with the sockets and our adapters!); it is also very close to Bedford Ave metro stop (L line). Following Starlee's suggestion, we tried the japanese restaurant in Grand Street, Samurai Mama. The food was amazing, especially the pork gyoza! There are two markets nearby, a Foodtown and a Whole Foods Market. And everything else you may need really...
Long story short, we look forward to going back!
"
19812,190955258,5/9/17,140750974,Ambar,"Pros: convenient location, excellent host, spacious apartment, comfortable bed

Cons: Starlee has a dog, so if you're allergic, maybe don't book this place!

Starlee was super flexible! My other Airbnb host cancelled my reservation 1 day before my reservation and Starlee was able to provide a welcoming and clean environment for me and my sister. Williamsburg is a great spot and we were able to get to Manhattan easily. I'd recommend this apartment to NY visitors!"

19812,205654969,22/10/17,23063962,Greg,Great location in Williamsburg and the coffee and tea left for us were a lovely touch by Starlee. We definitely hope to stay here again when we visit Williamsburg.

19812,272438989,3/6/18,321173,Kitty,"The perfect location in the middle of all the neighbourhood action. So close to everything you need in Williamsburg. There was so much room in this apartment, I truly felt like I was home.
Starlee was quick to reply to every question."
19812,277519740,16/6/18,10842999,Clara,"We were expecting something different. The first impression when we arrived was the street door full of garbage, boots on the corridor outside the apartment door, the whole place full of things (food in the fridge, shoes and clothes everywhere...), some of the bulb lights were burned (no light at all in the bedroom). The only day that we eat there we had to wash the cutlery because of the dirt so finally we only use the apartment to sleep. 
Pros: location and price."
19812,282905612,28/6/18,71774040,Marine,"Starlee est une personne très réactive, nous avons notamment eu un problème de wifi qu’elle a résolu immédiatement. 
Cependant concernant l’appartement en lui même, nous avons trouvé qu’il n’était pas propre (poussière, cheveux, un cafard vivant ! ), pas de climatisation...bien dommage au vu de la réactivité de Starlee."
19812,298703057,29/7/18,8097561,Adrian,"Starlee's place is typical of a slightly-run-down-but-charming-as-fuck NYC artists' apartment, filled with books and quirky decorative touches which I loved (especially all the text-based art, indicative of the fact that the host is a writer.) Starlee was super-quick to respond with answers to my questions, and everything was clean and lovely and set-up for a nice stay in Brooklyn. If you want a slice of arty Williamsburg living, this place is great!"

20299,61256,5/7/10,49142,Ellen,"Edward is very helpful and laid-back. I had a great experience staying with him. The apartment itself is a standard East Village one-bedroom (ie, it's in an older brick building and is not huge, but it has everything you need and the location is fantastic). The bedroom is comfortable. Edward keeps everything quite neat and clean and I had no problem coming and going as needed, even cooking a little, which made it an ideal non-hotel option for staying in New York. I would definitely stay with Edward again; it's like having a really nice roommate who also takes care of stuff for you."
20299,127181,25/10/10,218041,Calvin,"Edward was a great host!  He was respectful and very accommodating.  He was very laid back and it was easy to talk to him.  On top of all that, the location is great (Lower East Side, subway is close, bars/restaurants close as well).  I highly recommend anyone to stay at Edward's place!  Thanks again for everything E!

20299,137846,12/11/10,280160,Anna,"If you want to feel like a New Yorker...
Staying with Edward was the best introduction to the East Village that I could have hoped for. He knows every corner and almost everybody. He is a very easygoing host who goes out of his way to help and makes you feel very much at home and at ease. His apt is in a great location and very quiet only 5 minutes away from the subway and right next to a multitude of restaurants, bars and shops. 
I had the best time and I hope to be coming again soon!
"
20299,140022,16/11/10,255410,Judith,"After a lengthy trans-Atlantic journey and vibrant trip on the New York subway from JFK, Edward and his comfortable apartment welcomed the weary traveller.  He was kind, generous and helpful, inspirational in many respects. This locale in the East Village is all that one could want; such a colourful yet peaceful vibe! What's more, Edward knows that he is welcome to stay with me in London."
20299,209093,26/3/11,371051,Kimberly Anne,"Edward is a fantastic host, gracious and kind!!! He spent a lot of his time showing me around the city and really made me feel at home in his place. He even made me coffee in the mornings!!! He is so knowledgeable about NY and loves to share that knowledge with others. What a pleasure!!!"
20299,217443,4/4/11,12458,Charles,Edward is very accommodating and very flexible with my arrival and departure times.  The location is great too! Lots of restaurants nearby. You can't beat the price!
20299,230502,18/4/11,472050,Edwin,"Edward elevated my NYC experience. The night prior to my arrival, he called me to finalize the details, even though we had established the arrangement via email, but it was a pleasant surprise to receive a phone call from the host directly.

The day of my arrival, which was ten in the morning, I arrived about twenty minutes late but Edward was gracious with his warm welcome. He laid out several tourist pamphlets on the table, shared his experiences, his love of the East Village and recommended the places to visit. Edward is very approachable, personable and a laid back host.

Admittedly, the first night I scoured my bedroom for night crawlers and I was happy to find none. During my five nights stay, I had no concerned with bugs and I was told that New York can be a problem with pests. My bedroom is a good size room with plenty of space for luggage, etc. However, I travel light so I used the laundromat that is only a few meters away - it was very convenient.

Edward's home is located in the East Village. This neighbourhood is hip, trendy, with plenty of subway lines and the bus stop is literally around the corner. It is close to St. Marks Square. Besides Soho, the East Village is my second favourite spot for exploration and living like a New Yorker. 

Overall, for the price, location and a great host who is passionate to share his flat with you, Edward's place is the place to be when in New York.

Enjoy your stay!"
20299,241202,26/4/11,488572,Haifang,"Edward is a great host. He's very warn, kind, accommodating, laid back and helpful. The location is very hip and close to everything. I definitely recommend his place for people who want to get a true NYC experience. Thank you Edward!"
20299,246495,1/5/11,317482,Jose-Carlos,"Edwardo's place in the lower east side really is a gem on itself.  As his ad says, it is truly a great place to stay and experience what it is to live in NYC.  His place is small but quaint, clean, but best of all affordable and close to a subway station and tons of bars. Also, Edwardo is a great host who has the connections to let you know of hidden gems in the city."
20299,258620,10/5/11,526245,Carina,"Edward was a great host.  He's easy going, considerate and helpful.  His apartment is in an amazing location and he's willing to share the history of the East village, if you ask him.  I would stay there again if I visit in the future."
20299,264252,15/5/11,471879,Adrian,"Edwards love of New york was infectious I stayed 4nights  and really enjoyed my first visit.The location is excellent  with subway and dining options nearby.Edward was really helpful to the first time visitor with helpful hints on getting around and sightseeing,communication was good from booking to check out.The bedroom was quiet and sleeping was easy.I would stay here again if visiting NY.  
 (Website hidden by Airbnb) Thanks  Adrian O"
20299,280538,25/5/11,497879,Sherelle,"Eduardo was a great host! Very accommodating, personable, and informative about NY, about the best routes to get around and how to find out more neighborhood happenings! His apartment is perfectly located to wherever else in NY you are trying to go- from Brooklyn to Midtown -to Central Park! The East Village neighborhood is totally walkable with something to see and do at every turn. Eduardo was right! You do ""feel"" like a villager, apart of the neighborhood, apart of the real New York you can't see in pamphlets or on 42nd Street. And if you are traveling alone I suggest choosing Eduardo's location or similar to get that neighborhood feel. I felt safe, its a vibrant neighborhood, I met people and got to explore the real NY. It's a small apartment but big enough to be a great base camp to easily come and go to all of the activities you planned to do and see while in NY. I would definitely stay here again!"
20299,289080,30/5/11,616757,Bin,"The place is basically close to everything, subway, bar, restaurants, etc. I didn't get time to go out at night, but my observation is there is many options if you want to enjoy a vibrant night life. The room is not a luxurious one but have a comfortable bed for you to sleep and enough privacy if you don't want to be disturbed. I also enjoy the talk with Edward. He's a very considerate and helpful and help me a lot on the public transportation in NYC. The bottom line: if you are on a tight budget and still want to stay on Manhattan while have a decent place to rest, this is the place for you."
20299,299947,6/6/11,545019,Leonardo,"Edwar was great!

20299,340498,28/6/11,598999,Isabel,"Edward was wonderful! Very helpful and knows a lot about NYC! I liked that he was very flexible and laid back, and he definitely gave me my own space during my stay. We were both in and out of the apartment which was cool.
As for location, the train is only a few blocks away and the area is VERY walkable and safe! I traveled solo and it was my first time in NYC; I found the location to be completely fine. Overall a wonderful weekend with a bonus of a new friend! "
20299,347937,2/7/11,662302,John,"Edward is a great host & is very familiar with NY.  He's flexible & very easy to get along with; you shouldn't have any difficulty in ""connecting"" with him.  If you're looking for a basic place to sleep in a prime location, this is a very good option.  Keep in mind that the host does say the bed if firm (and it is).  The separate room was nice, but it can be warm on a hot day.  I would definitely stay here again!"
20299,362863,9/7/11,631476,Conny,Edward was a really nice host. He was very helpful and flexible. It was really easy to find his appartement and a good communication. The room was a basic nice place and in the heart of east village. Thank you very much.

His apt is just in one of the best spots ever with bars, restaurants, local merchants, and the subway train all within a few blocks of each other. Edward is a great host in a great location for a great price. I would definitely rent here again and again!"
20299,389858,22/7/11,152131,Bill,"This was my first shared rental so I was not sure what to expect.  If all shared hosts are anything like Edward it will not be my last.

Edward was an outstanding host, from the last minute reservation acceptance to the attention he paid to making sure I was comfortable.

The apartment is in an outstanding location and ample street parking is available in the area.  A true East Village experience in all respects."

He is a really nice and knowledgeable guy and is happy to talk to you about the area and its attractions. He was always really accommodating and did his best to make the place as comfortable as possible. 

His place worked really well for my visit. Its in a great location in the East Village that is quiet but still has nightlife around it. Close to the subway and cabs so transportation isn't an issue. "

EDWARD IS A STRAIGHT SHOOTER, TELL IT THE WAY IT IS, KNOWS THE CITY WELL AND GIVES YOU IDEAS TO CHECK OUT. IF YOUR GOING TO BE IN THE CITY ALL DAY THERE IS NO REASON TO PAY THE HIGH PRICES OF HOTELS, I SLEPT SHOWERED AND WAS GONE FOR THE DAY. EDWARD IS VERY EASY GOING AND FRIENDLY A GREAT GUY TO STAY WITH THANKS EDWARD, BRIAN"
20299,678713,1/11/11,371769,Christine,Edward was a wonderful host. The weather turned unexpectedly wet and cold during my visit to NYC so I spent more time indoors than I had planned. Edward made me feel at home in his place and we shared some enjoyable discussions. The place is clean and very convenient to everything I was interested in. I hope to stay there again on my next visit to the city.
20299,718072,14/11/11,1328179,Armand,Edward is an amazing host. Have a seat and a conversation with him and you can see behind his tattoes. He has a great knowledge about nyc and more. The apt is clean and suche a good location! thx for all :)

The room is great, everything you need with lots of privacy. Location is great as well convenient to all major new york destinations."
20299,1052534,27/3/12,1881087,Jean-Yves,"Does Edwardo need another good review? I guess not, but it is not my fault, he was a wonderful host even if I was not the easiest guest: I checked in pretty late, waking up early and bugging him to get tips about NYC. He even was kind enough to let one my friend, who was in trouble finding a room, stay on the last night. And yes, Edwardo is a gold mine of information about NYC. He truly loves his city. If you are nice enough, he'll share a cup of his coffee (pretty strong, careful) with you and will tell you all about his East Village. So would I recommend Edwardo's place to my grand mother, no, but any traveler can book this place blindfolded. And I myself will book it again any time. It was great to meet you Ed!"

I would recommend this lovely little spot and it's very kind host to anyone. I hope to be able to come back and visit soon."

As a photographer this was especially useful to me. The apartment was clean and clean linens and bed sheets where provided as advertised. Edward is an old skool New Yorker and had plenty of interesting stories about the history of Lower East Side and the surrounding neighbourhoods.

During my stay in NY, he suggested a nice walk through the Lower East Side and side where I took wonderful photos! He also suggested a traditional anual festival in Coney Island that if weren't for his suggestion I would never know. Finally, I had some free rides thanks to the indications of Edward! Staying in his apartment is very pleasant and if you have difficulties with the English language he can talk to you in Spanish or French. All I can do is thank him for all the learning, courtesy and friendship!"

Thank you Edward for making my stay so memorable and opening up your apartment to me. I hope to meet you again one day. 
20299,2484937,2/10/12,1319167,Timothy,"Edward is a great host with a knowledge of NewYork and the Lower East side that is hard to top. His appartment is located in the heart of the Lower East Side and not to far away from the train and other interesting sites in the area. 

The room we rented was  suitable for our three days stay. I would always rent from Edward again."
20299,2572575,10/10/12,1699947,Ben,Edward is great and he can recommend some good place to see and eat. The room is good and bed was comfortable I found it very easy to get into the central city from Edward's place I also felt save in the area. I would recommend this listing to any one looking for a affordable friendly and place in New York.
20299,2702310,24/10/12,3626724,Dave,"My stay was wonderful - You get your own room and Edward is a really nice guy. He is very low key and is a big help with directions. I felt more like a house guest by the end of the trip. Thanks, Edward, for helping make my trip memorable."
20299,2927230,20/11/12,1185489,Gabriel,"Edward was an excellent host, very helpful and kind, made sure my stay was the most pleasant possible, I can only thank him for everything, your room is very comfortable and provided me with excellent nights rest after long hikes in NY. I definitely recommend Edward's house to anyone who wants to spend quality time in this wonderful city, because besides everything he still gave me valuable tips about the city and how to get around it. I am very grateful to Edward."
20299,3136357,22/12/12,146525,David,"Edward was a warm, kind and gracious host who made my stay in NYC completely enjoyable. His place is quaint, and clean. A real slice of what it is to be a real, boots on the ground New Yorker. Edward is an incredible conversationalist who will regail you with stories if you have the opportunity to. I can not recommend him enough both as a host to  stay with and as a person in general."
20299,3530573,12/2/13,4986050,Veronica,"Staying at Edward's house was a wonderful experience.
My flight was cancelled because of the storm and I arrived to days later than expected. I could change my reservation dates without any problem.
Edward's advice was really useful during my fists two days in NYC, and talking to him was really interesting.
The house is not very big, but located in a perfect area. 
The bathroom was clean and the bedroom comfortable and quiet.

20299,3597221,20/2/13,1620472,Lu,"You see a different NYC after talking with Edward. Never have I met a person who loves this city that much, if you're totally new to NYC you should choose to stay with him and learn every corner of the city. Location is pretty nice, close to lots of great dinning spots. My departure time was really early (4 in the morning) and thank you Edward for being considerate to that."
20299,3650376,27/2/13,5115511,Sara,"Edward is an excellent and interesting host who knows the history of every back alley of lower Manhattan. As a female traveling alone I felt completely safe staying in his apartment. He is caring in a very respectful way. You get your own room with a comfortable and clean bed and towels, a good shower and good heating in the winter. As stated before in other reviews it's not a luxury hotel, but more than enough for my needs. The location is great in the heart of Manhattan with walking distance to everything. Thank you Edward for sharing your time and stories with me. I hope to return. //Sara"
20299,3753424,11/3/13,4551501,Thomas,"I had a great time with Edward. He is very welcoming and loves to help out with any qestions you might have about the city. His inside knowledge is great, especially if this is your first time to NYC.
Edward always tried to make my stay as comfortable as possible."

20299,4057195,6/4/13,5646101,Lari,"Edward is an amazing host: He knows the city and its history and he's willing to share some amazing tips. Make sure you go those places he suggests! He also gives you the privacy when you want it. The room is quite big, given the fact thats its nyc after all, its also very quiet so noises wont bother your sleep. "
20299,4096421,9/4/13,5300008,Tiffany,"It was a whirlwind weekend trip to the city for a family event-- my first trip to the city and my first airbnb stay. A perfect introduction to the city was found in Edward. His apartment was easy to find and easy to get to from other locations in the city. I highly recommend him to women traveling alone (unless you are high-maintenance, then I encourage you to get a hotel).

I did not get a chance to take advantage of all he suggested, but will most definitely return to do do. We discovered a mutual friend, who he was able to connect me with, which turned into the highlight of my trip. Philosopher, poet, historian, fisherman-- all in all Renaissance man. Being new to the city, it was refreshing to visit with someone so relaxed and easy-going. Many thanks, Edward, you are a gem. "
20299,4328070,28/4/13,1748716,Steffi,"I stayed with Edward for a week on a business trip. He is superfriendly, willing to help and full of great stories about NYC. My sister used to live a few blocks away so I am familiar with the neighbourhood, which was the driver for my choosing Edward's place. The East Village is good if you're looking for bargain but safe and convenient accommodation. PS I tried the masseur right downstairs and it was good!"
20299,4364123,30/4/13,5655573,Markus,"Edward - Thanks a lot for hosting me! 
He is a great guy - in any respect. I had a great time with him. He knows a lot of details of his town NYC.
He was very helpful.Edward: I´ll be back!
;-)"
20299,4603215,14/5/13,6145382,Steve,"Edward was a great host, and his apartment is very conveniently located for exploring  the East Village and Manhattan. Edward gave me useful tips for exploring the city, and we had several interesting conversations - it was really great to get genuine insight into life in the city. Edward is respectful and easy going and was flexible on my arrival and departure times - overall this was a great first airbnb experience, many thanks Edward!"
20299,4702296,21/5/13,998332,Scott,"Edward was totally easy going and flexible. His simple rules aren't arduous to follow at all, and the location was great. It's a small place, and nothing fancy, but he doesn't misrepresent that at all in the ad. So as far as meeting my expectations, I'm giving him full marks."
20299,4873410,30/5/13,5384147,David,Edward has lots of stories that make the Lower East Side come alive. His humble apartment is comfortable and close to everything or to the subway where every place is accessible. This is a taste of New York you could not find elsewhere.
20299,4921079,2/6/13,1976963,An,Edward was the perfect host. His apt. is located very near the metro and broadway and all shops. The room was clean & tidy and he was always willing to share a story or assist whenever needed. I'd recommend staying at his place.
20299,5035154,9/6/13,1912112,Nicholas,"Edward is a very interesting fellow and easy to get along with, I enjoyed talking with him about his experiences over time in New York. The accommodations weren't fancy, as he described up front, but were quite satisfactory and quiet."
20299,5069850,10/6/13,6679058,Alex,"Edward is very accommodating host! It was a pleasure to meet him and to hear some stories about NYC. 

I'm very thankful to Ed for his flexibility when I had to adjust my travel plans!

Highly recommended!  "
20299,5134299,14/6/13,6487249,David,"I had a fantastic time in New York City. Edward is absolutely easy going. He knows so much about his city and gave me a lot of very helpful tips on how to explore this great city. His apartment is situated perfectly to get an impression of the real City of New York. From there you can discover so many things just by walking through the blocks. Although his apartment is so central, it is a very quiet place, where you can recover perfectly from strenuous days.

Thank you Edward. I would love to come back!
"
20299,5485111,2/7/13,887016,Jerome,"The room is exactly what Edward describes, he makes it a point that he's welcoming you to his home not a hotel. He knows a lot about NY and its history, he had tons of suggestions for things to do. "
20299,5559745,6/7/13,6471024,Ali,"Edward was a fantastic host - like everyone before me has said already, he is so knowledgeable about NYC, he helped me with so many handy tips about what to see and how to get around, that it would've been a lot harder without him!  He made me feel so welcome in his home - he was very laid back and understood when I needed to shower after getting home very late, waking him up! Sorry about that Edward!  He's a really interesting guy with a great spirit - he will now be a great part of my New York memories. 
The room was clean, fresh bedsheets and fluffy towels, two big fans to help keep you cool and a nice clean bathroom to use whenever you need that freshen-up shower!  The area is also really cool because you get to see a part of New York which you probably wouldn't see if you were staying in Midtown.  It feels more 'real' in Lower East Side.  Also close to subway stations, grocery and drug stores and other interesting areas.

Overall great first experience in New York City!  Thanks for your help Edward :-)"
20299,5659599,10/7/13,6380482,Louisa,"As soon as you enter Edward's apartment you know you're in authentic New York. It's not flash, designer or big, doesn't have a view, it's fairly compact, in fact a bit cluttered, and low key. But it's clean, quiet, and a real treat to have as a base.  Edward communicated clearly his expectations of me as a guest, then left the rest up to me. He's a very considerate and kind host, with whom you can choose to converse with or not, whatever suits.  He's also an encyclopedia of info, has a great take on life, and I felt really well looked after. Thanks, Edward   "
20299,5910993,22/7/13,6662744,Lance,"Stayed with Mr. Arrocha an extremely hot weekend in New York.  He was a pleasant host.  The room was adequate, but not air-conditioned and had no window.  It was extremely hot.  The room provided was clean, as was the bathroom, though the rest of the house was littered indiscriminately.  New York is expensive, so I probably got my money's worth."
20299,6157018,1/8/13,6535675,Rasmus,"Edward is a very nice host and can tell you a lot about NY. I really enjoyed my stay at his place; it is very conveniently located, very authentic and you're in the middle of things and still it is quiet and you get a good night's sleep. The room you get is not big or fancy, but has a big bed, TV,  chair, chest of drawers and a place to hang some clothes. It is wall-to-wall with the kitchen (you see the door to the room on the pictures) but not noisy. His apartment is basic, a little used, and not big (so just as he describes it), but it is clean and everything works etc.
I can recommend a stay at his place!"
20299,6306162,7/8/13,7233305,Gabriela,"Edward was a fantastic host and a great help to me during the most stressful part of my trip after I had misplaced my luggage. He kept things in perspective and reminded me that I shouldn't let it ruin my trip, and for that I am very grateful. 

It was also interesting to hear about how different areas in NY have changed over time and to get tips on some less tourist-y places to visit. Would definitely stay with him again!"
20299,6460868,13/8/13,7055100,Sander,Edward was very helpful with recommending things for me to do during my stay. I'd recommend him to anyone going to visit NYC.

20299,6980984,2/9/13,132759,David,Edward is a lovely guy and I enjoyed our morning chats before I'd head out.  His place is in a great location with a subway a few blocks away and a deli across the street for morning coffee.  I would recommend staying here.  Thanks for hosting me Edward!  
20299,7135855,8/9/13,7367485,Allen,"Had a great time in the city! Ed is very hospitable, respectful, and just plain cool. The room is exactly how it is described. The location could not be any better either! East Village is a great place to stay. Would definitely recommend!"
20299,7642859,28/9/13,7681098,Attila,"Edward is a very courteous host. It was a very enjoyable, pleasant stay."
20299,8293513,24/10/13,8406737,Pierre,"J'ai logé chez Edward dans l'East Village. C'est un quartier que je recommande chaudement pour quelques jours à NYC. Un peu à l'écart de effervescence de la mégapole, ce quartier reste à taille humaine, avec de petits endroits pour déjeuner qui ne semblent pas impersonnels, des gens qui marchent moins vite qu'ailleurs, un p'tit coin vraiment sympa. Edward grand amoureux de sa ville s'est toujours rendu disponible pour m'expliquer ou me conseiller sur mes visites ou les chemins à emprunter. Le matin je partais entre 8 h 30 et 9 h 00 aprés ma douche pour ne revenir au moins aprés 21 h 00 pour me coucher. Je n'ai vraiment utilisé la chambre chez Edward que pour y dormir la nuit. Je considère que j'étais chez quelqu'un et non à l'hotel ; ce qui à mes yeux ne m'autorise pas à passer du temps dans le salon de mon hote à trainer une partie de la matinée ou de l'aprés midi. J'étais là pour profiter de la ville uniquement. NYC est une ville où l'on marche beaucoup. Si je devais conseiller quelqu'un, je lui dirais de privilégier le bus qui permet de découvrir la ville et qui est somme toute assez rapide (la ville n'est pas bouchée en permanence comme l'est Paris que je connais bien)"
20299,8407749,29/10/13,8793882,Laetitia,"I spent 5 nights in Edward´s appt and as a first Airbnb experience, it was excellent! Edward is a very nice and flexible host who can tell you (in English and in French!!!!!) all you want to know about NYC. His flat is very well located and the neighborhood is really safe even late, easy to get to subway & Bus. The room was perfect for me:  It is clean and quiet (this is a home, not a hotel). I highly recommend the place to women traveling alone. Many thanks Edward for making my first stay in NYC so great!!! I'll definitely come back to stay at Edward's home again."
20299,8969557,29/11/13,9665449,Sarah,"Best place to come stay in New York! Edward is an amazing air B&B host with a knowledge and passion for New York that is second to none.

20299,18631513,29/8/14,19479184,Rahel,It was my first time in NY and I had a wonderful stay! The apartment is very good located. So I walked a lot and discovered the city by foot. But the subway station is close too. Edward is a friendly and interesting guy and knows a lot about NY and the different districts. The apartment is simple but there is everything you need and the room is quiet and I slept very well. I had a great time in NY and I can only recommend Edward as host. 
20299,19895594,20/9/14,16800150,Lior,"I spent 3 nights at Edward Arrocha’s place and enjoyed it much. Edward was a great host to stay with -  fun, smart, intelligent and a great guy to speak with about almost any topic possible. He is a walking encyclopedia of NYC and fishery,  and can provide you with wonderful ideas about the city and what it has to offer (even for the experienced traveler who’s been to NYC many times). 
The place is basic and is certainly what one should expect for such a rate in NYC. I did not expected otherwise, and had a great stay. My room was comfortable and clean.There are lots of restaurants, cafes and transportation options around. I definitely recommend."
20299,21666203,21/10/14,219537,Slava,"Edward is a very nice guy. He truly loves NYC and can tell you lots of interesting facts about it. If you want to see smth besides the famous attractions you can ask him and I am sure he knows smth you will like.

The apartment had all I needed. Location is very good: close to subway, chinatown; walking distance from Union square and many other interesting places."
20299,28182486,19/3/15,9829691,Rodrigo,"You will hardly find someone with more knowledge of NYC. Edward was a very welcoming host, always willing to share his insights. The location is great, close to all sorts of restaurants and very convenient for transportation. A+"
20299,29560816,9/4/15,28373001,Frank R.,"Edward's apartment was precisely what I was looking for when I looked on Air BnB for somewhere cool and affordable to stay in New York for the week. In fact, it exceeded my expectations. I can't imagine anything nearly as good for the price. 

Great location, cool, laid-back atmosphere, welcoming hosts. The transport connections/amenities are fantastic. The nearest subway station is a few minutes walk away and has easy access to Brooklyn/Manhattan/Queens.

All in all - highly recommended, would visit again."
20299,31241792,3/5/15,4007766,Ehud,"Edward,
You are warm hosts with a desire to enrich the experiences of stay in the city. Because of you, I started to learn about the soul of the neighborhood and the city. You have good advice and amazing knowledge of the city.

He is a very welcoming host, has a great passion for New York, and can give you many off the track advice on where to go in the city (according to your own interests). His apartment is close to the F train and major bus lines, so very easy to get around town. This is definitely the best option to go if you are looking for a clean, basic, well located and affordable place to stay in New York. Would go back anytime. "
20299,32482512,18/5/15,9643822,Ken,"Edward is an excellent host.  His place is clean, comfortable, convenient, and quiet.

Every establishment he recommended turned out to be ""spot on"".  I would stay here again, absolutely."
20299,32846602,22/5/15,462976,Christian,"The room and apt was exactly as advertised. Edward is a wonderful host, knowledgable about NYC and the neighborhood, and ready to help out if I ever got lost or in trouble. Edward is one of my favorite hosts I've met on Airbnb. And the neighborhood is my favorite in the city so, if you're looking for a good, friendly, affordable place to rest your body after a day of exploring, this is the place to be. "
20299,33122273,25/5/15,5912282,Simon,"Edward was very respectful and flexible, I told him that I would arrive between 8-10pm on my first night, but then I ran a little late, so I called him to let him know, then he waited for me (as he was about to go to bed). Awesome host!  And there's no set check-out time.  Edward can basically accommodate your need as long as it's reasonable.

Other than that, the location was great, close to the subway, few blocks from all subway lines.  Bars/restaurants are within walking distance, also the location is close to St Mark's "
20299,34870725,13/6/15,31800075,Polina,"If you want a real Downtown experience it is your place to be! Edward is a great host, he really LOVES New York like only oldtimer can and he can tell you all the hidden places, where you won't see any tourists! The spots!

Area is amazing, all the great parts of the Downtown are walking distance away.
I really enjoyed my time exploring the City and Ed's apt was a great base to do that!"
20299,36093688,25/6/15,4643922,Daniel,"This apartment was exactly as advertised and if you are a single traveler looking for a private room and space to keep your stuff while you explore the city, it is ideal.

Edward is a great host as he is friendly, knowledgeable and very accommodating. As long as you appreciate what you are getting for this excellent value price in the heart of the East Village, you'll be fine here."
20299,36808476,1/7/15,32338676,Megan,Edward was a very accommodating and friendly host. He definitely knows his stuff about New York! He has heaps of great tips and suggestions. The location is also such a gem. There are so many amazing bars and restaurants in the area I was sad I couldn't stay longer. I felt very safe and slept extremely well. The room was quiet and comfortable which was a welcome change from the noisy motel I had come from. This is a great spot if you're a solo traveler who wants to see a little more than just the generic tourist attractions. Thanks Edward! ;)
20299,37917449,11/7/15,23901715,Andy,"Edward is great! I didn't get much time to hang out because I was busy in the city but the room and bathroom were clean and I slept just fine!

The neighborhood is quite exciting, too, with lots of bars and restaurants. Edward is a great host. He loves NYC passionately, knows everything about it, and is more than willing to offer advice about where to go and what to do around town. "
20299,39578394,24/7/15,17276025,Sharon,"Summary:  If you are looking for a cheap place to just sleep and shower, and are not picky, this could be a good choice for you.
Pros: 
-Edward is a great host - very friendly and super helpful!  Note: he has tattoos all over his arms and face, which can make him seem intimidating at first. (he even said so himself). But he is very kind and trustworthy.  
-Great location. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance & easy to get around on the subway. I felt safe walking back from the subway late at night.
-Inexpensive
-Quiet
-The important things were clean - e.g. the bed sheets, towels, and bathroom were clean. 
Cons:
-The overall apt. was only marginally clean. Lots of clutter, scuffs on the walls, small hole in my door, stains on the chair, etc. Note: my door did not have a lock on it (which was fine - I had no issues - but just mentioning it in case that matters to you).
-No air conditioning, but there were 2 fans in the room. This was only problematic because the first day I was there it was over 90 degrees.  There are no windows in the room so it got quite hot and stuffy, which intensified all of the smells of the city and some kind of cooking smell in the apartment (I can't place what it was?)  The bed is OK, but IMO not as comfortable as some people have said.  It was hard to sleep that night.  But it cooled down to the mid-80's the next 2 days, which made it much more tolerable, and then I slept fine. 

While this is not necessarily a pro or a con, I want to make it clear that Edward sleeps in the living room (the listing said that it is ""his space"", but I wasn't totally sure what that meant when I read the description).  I actually barely saw him because I was out of the apt. so much, so this was fine.  Like I said, I was only there to sleep and shower, so I appreciated having a cheap place to stay on a last-minute trip.  I also felt safe staying there as a woman traveling solo. Thanks to Edward for his hospitality!"
20299,39990341,27/7/15,36625443,Craig,"Edward was a very nice man and helpful with information about the city and neighborhood.   His apartment is in a fantastic and vibrant neighborhood that I really enjoyed.   For those wanting a bed to sleep in, a good starting point and flexibilty, this place is for you.  For those needing a little more in amenities, it probably isn't for you.   My only concern was the cleanliness of the room, as I was not certain the sheets were clean.  If that part of the situation is improved, this place will be fine for independent travelers."
20299,40766039,2/8/15,35770061,Jasmine,"What a wonderful place!

Edward is incredibly accommodating and knowledgeable about the city; it was my first time in NYC and he was able to give me a good picture of the area, along with some history and background, and recommended many places to check out. He is so friendly and chill, really made my week a pleasant one. Additionally, to cope with the intense heat that the city was experiencing at the time, he had plenty of fans going, which felt great after a day of walking around.

The room is tidy and has plenty of space for someone who will spend most of their time out and about in the city. The apartment is close to subway stations and within walking distance of several great places to eat and see live music (one could easily walk to Mercury Lounge, Bowery Electric, Bowery Ballroom, Arlene's Grocery). The neighborhood is vibrant bustling with life, even at night. Honestly, this location was ideal for me. Would definitely come back!

20299,42876986,16/8/15,27160110,Liam,"Edward is one of the nicest hosts I've met on AirBnB. He was very welcoming and has encyclopedic knowledge of New York - forget your Lonely Planet, this guy knows it all and more. It is very conveniently located in the Lower East Side. It is very close to the metro and the surrounding area has loads of bars, restaurants and is alive all the time, it really gives you that cool Manhattan feel. However, you get what you pay for. The place is a good price for a private room in Manhattan in such a great location. The place is a little run down, for example the shower didn't have a shower head and the fans were very dusty, I found dust over my bed after leaving one on.  There is no AC but the room has two fans. It got pretty hot but it was ok while I was there when the temperature was in the mid 80's, any hotter and it might be uncomfortable. Ed sleeps in the living room and you have to go through there to get to the bathroom. I had no problem at night going in there to brush my teeth without waking him. Ed was a really cool host, he let me leave my bags until the evening, well after the check out time. As long as you are just looking for a place to crash, shower, something that is cheap and not looking for luxury or to hangout then this will work."
20299,44122032,24/8/15,3260074,Wesley,"Leave your guidebook at home, Edward will tell you everything you need to know about New York plus he makes you feel a home straight away. As descriped you are staying in somebodys  home so do not expect that everything is as tidy as in a hotel Room. But bed and bathroom are clean. Bedroom is quiet and dark and matrass comfortable so you can have a good night rest before you start exploring this fantastic neighbourhood and the rest of the city.
 "
20299,45381676,2/9/15,13494959,Tito,"Edward is a wonderful host. The very first day we spent more than one hour talking about the city and all the possible places i could visit, with plenty of tips coming from his decade-long experience living in New York. The appartment is cozy and nestled in the middle of East Village, great and super-safe place for both bars and clubs at night, or hanging around by day. "
20299,46208218,8/9/15,32623,Hai,"Edward's place is as described: comfortable bed in a private room.  The location is just a short walk from the subway; many restaurants and groceries just steps away.  You do share the bathroom with the owner.  It's a perfect place for someone just want a play to sleep and shower.  It needs updates but clean.

Edward make great suggestions of places to see.  He is very down-to-earth and nice to talk to.
"
20299,47501357,19/9/15,41108024,Andres,"Great host and the place is really good. Specially if you go for few days, very well located and Edward helped me a lot with tips and directions... Awesome experience with a world citizen like Edward"
20299,49802559,6/10/15,4792058,Stephen,"Edward is a great host.
He gave a very warm welcome and quick tour of his apartment.  The room is private, and Edward respects this privacy.

Location is supreme.
Not only are the subways nearby, the location is near famous East Village staples including Katz's Deli, Russ & Daughters, and Please Don't Tell."
20299,52859813,2/11/15,30317720,San,"Edward is a very polite and considerate host. He is very transparent with his potential guests so ask questions. Don't be offended if he decides not to accept your request because most likely he doesn't feel that his place will accommodate to your needs. If you want a simple and quiet place to stay with a very knowledgeable host, you won't be disappointed. There are no bells and whistles here, just a comfortable bed and great host."
20299,53506371,9/11/15,9601596,Aaron,"Edward is a really great person with a ton of knowledge. I appreciated staying with him. 

I was very busy running around New York and exploring. I used the guest room as more of a crash pad. I slept and showered there. Other than that, I was running around. 

That worked well with me. 

I really found Edward to be a pleasure to talk to and a great host. "
20299,56374862,13/12/15,12031690,Adam,"Effectivement, l'appartement est très bien situé... mais avant tout, Edward est un homme incroyable, qui m'a fait découvrir New York sous un autre aspect."
20299,60501593,24/1/16,5689981,Patricia,Edward was a most hospitable host. He welcomed me into his home and was there with help and guidance for both the neighborhood and New York City in general.  He went beyond what was required when I was stranded in New York because of the Jan 25th blizzard. He allowed me to stay in his home for no additional charge. I truly appreciate this. It shows his true nature and I thank him very much. 
20299,65570312,15/3/16,3615915,Lidia,"I stayed 5 days at Edward's and I really felt at home. He's very kind and we talked about so many things- it seems he lived ten lives!
Edward's appartment is on the quiet part of the East Village, which means you can enjoy an amazing neighbourhood without suffering the noise. 
I would absolutely reccomend staying at Edward's and I'm so grateful to him for making New York a much friendlier place."
20299,67500701,29/3/16,6797450,Quincy,"It was a pleasure to stay with Edward.  Edward provided me lots of good advice on travelling in New York, which are particularly useful as this was the first time I travel to NY, and I very much enjoyed chatting with him.  

His apartment is in a safe neighbourhood and it takes only a short walk to the nearest subway station. I stayed outside quite late one night for a broadway show, but I didn't feel in anyway uncomfortable during my brief walk from the station as there were still quite a lot of people in the streets at night.

As for Edward's one-room studio apartment, I stayed in the bedroom with a large comfortable bed and Edward stayed in the living room.  At times there were some sounds from the pipes but overall they didn't bother me a lot and I had very good sleep for all nights.

I will certainly stay with Edward again when I travel to NY next time.  Thanks a lot, Edward, for your hospitality and do drop me a call if you come by Hong Kong!"
20299,69778121,13/4/16,57157977,Juan,"Edwards home was exactly was I was looking for. A place to sleep and take a shower after exploring all day the city. It is located a  in very nice and interesting neighbourhood, 2/3 blocks from the F line (4 min walking) and there are some beatiful parks and bars with music around. Edward is very warm, knows the city and it's history in a real way and didn't have any problem in giving you great advices. It was a pleasure, so I hope to return someday"
20299,71172330,24/4/16,51951666,Сергей,"Good location and welcomed host. I’ve got everything I need room, bed and shower.  "
20299,75349999,20/5/16,27256053,Audrey,"Milles merci à Edward, c'est quelqu'un de très accueillant et toujours disponible pour offrir ses conseils!
C'est un vrai New Yorkais, exactement comme je souhaitais en rencontrer, c'était super de partager avec quelqu'un qui aime autant sa ville, j'étais toujours ravie de lui raconter toute mes découvertes et d'entendre les siennes c'est quelqu'un de formidable et de généreux qui vous fera vous sentir comme chez vous!
C'est toujours agréable quand on vient seule de pouvoir échanger avec son hôte en rentrant!
C'était mon rêve de découvrir New York et j'ai eu l'impression d'y vivre pendant presque 2 semaines!
Le lit est très confortable et c'est très sympa après une grande journée de marche !
L'appartement est très bien situé à quelques minutes du métro peut être 5 ou 10 minutes! Même en rentrant tard seule il n'y avait aucun souci il y a toujours du monde dans les rues!
J'espère pouvoir revenir chez Edward dès que possible c'est quelqu'un de passionnant mais qui vous laisse aussi votre intimité si besoin c'est un super colocataire et un super hôte! 
Il faut prendre son temps pour découvrir cette ville magnifique les gens sont toujours ravie de vous aider ou de vous renseigner et Edward incarne très bien celà!
Merci encore Edward, take care !

20299,82253062,27/6/16,13475613,Abhishek,It was great staying with Edward. He knows a lot about New York and it was a delight talking to him. The place is nice and is very close to the subway.
20299,86328409,16/7/16,6374977,Marie,"Really great host! Edward is super sweet and knows all the ins and outs of NYC and his neighborhood. He gave me a bunch of food suggestions and site seeing tips, and his place is very easy to reach from the airport and close to several train lines for getting further into Manhattan. I stayed there for work and it was just what I needed- a safe place to stay, not a lot of hanging around in the apartment. The room is private, incredibly quiet (surprising for such a busy city), comfy bed, everything he says in the description. I would absolutely stay here again and would recommend Edward as a host."
20299,87923340,22/7/16,78518856,Kiyoshi,"During my staying, I could stay in confort.
Especially, the location is nice, close to various stores, bars, subway startion, therefore, to go downtown was easiler than I expected.
And also, Edward supported me well.
He tried to give me a sound advice, accutally, his advice always helped me to do things during staying in NY.

From above, if I have anothre opportunity to come back here, I will stay here again, and also I recommend persom, who plan to stay in NY."
20299,92615753,9/8/16,23039051,Antonella,"Ho soggiornato da Edward per 9 notti e mi sono trovata benissimo. Lui è molto disponibile, mi ha fornito consigli sulla città e la sua personale visione delle cose. Ho apprezzato molto la cosa, mi ha aiutata veramente a farmi una idea di NYC. La casa è quella che si vede nella foto, non si vede solo la stanza in cui si dorme, la quale non è altro che una stanza con un letto matrimoniale, una cassettiera e dei ventilatori, più gli asciugamani che ci fornisce per uso personale. Di notte si sentono un po' di rumori da fuori, ma non ho avuto mai avuto problemi a dormire. 
Personalmente l'ho trovato un ottimo compromesso. La zona è ottima, in pochi minuti a piedi si raggiungono diverse fermate della metro e si va ovunque. Parlando di sicurezza, la zona l'ho trovata molto frequentata, anche tornando a casa a tarda sera mi sono sempre sentita tranquilla. Ricapitolando, l'alloggio di per sé è spartano, fornisce il minimo che serve al turista che va in giro tutto il giorno: un letto per dormire e un bagno per farsi la doccia (anche la cucina, ma non l'ho mai usata). La zona è ben collegata e l'ho trovata sicura. Edward è disponibilissimo a dare consigli. Se non si è troppo schizzinosi e si vuole visitare NYC per parecchi giorni senza spendere una fortuna (stando comunque in un buona zona) questo allora è un ottimo posto."
20299,97613752,28/8/16,71901739,Micah,"Ed's place was perfect for what I needed - a base of operations to explore the city, and a great location from which to do so! Ed himself was extremely hospitable, and always eager to help or answer any questions I had about the city. "
20299,99094690,3/9/16,19842250,Barbara,"Edward es un gran hombre, amable y disponible y sobretodo un pozo de informaciones! La casa no es grande pero poco importa, tiene lo que uno necesita, una cama comoda para descansar; está perfectamente ubicada y la zona es vivaz pero tranquila, nunca me sentí en peligro. Gracias Edward, lo pasé genial!"
20299,100568580,10/9/16,32216828,Thibault,"If you want to enjoy New York, to walk the streets, to spend time outside... anyway, if you like to visit: this place is very convenient. Do not expect to find a very luxurious apartment,  but who cares? There's a comfortable bed and a invigorating shower! And most of all: Edward really helps you organizing your trip. His precious advice about transport, better spots to take pictures of Manhattan, tricks to enjoy the city as a New-Yorker are so useful! "
20299,103909541,24/9/16,72454885,Keinana Kady,"Appartement très bien situé, très calme aussi. Beaucoup de deli et de restaurant aux alentours. 
Edward est un très gentil hôte. Très généreux en conseils et en attention, respecteux envers ses invités et respectueux de leur espace. 
L'appartement manque juste d'une petite touche féminine."
20299,109310290,20/10/16,84414507,Damijan,Don't have anything to add to the numerous previous reviews about Edward. Recommend!
20299,110328301,25/10/16,41588421,Teodora,"Edward is a wonderful host, he helped me with my suitcases and provided all the information about his apartment. Also he helped me getting around the city and gave really useful tips about places to go, things to see.  I enjoyed my stay here especially because Edward made me feel welcomed.

The apartment is in a really nice area with a lot of bars and restaurants, very safe and most of all, quite close to the metro and bus stations. The room is a bit small but it's perfect if you're a tourist, it provides everything that you need in order to rest after a long day of walking in NYC."
20299,111448044,31/10/16,38674659,Will,"Edward is one of the nicest people I've met in a long while.  He was a very welcoming, informative, and kind host, willing to share stories and perspectives and a wealth of knowledge about NYC.  For anyone looking to experience the city on a budget, in particular, he can be helpful.  His description of the apartment is correct, and as he put it his place is probably best for people who are ""between hostels and hotels""; it's certainly no frills, but the bed is comfortable, there are drawers and closet space open for your clothes, and the subway is just about 5 minutes from his front door and takes you all over Manhattan.  The Lower East is an interesting neighborhood, too, and within easy walking distance I found great pizza and super pastrami, with lots of other options.  This is a particularly good option for single travelers as the bedroom is a little cramped for two maybe (though the bed is a queen), but if you're mainly looking for a place to crash while exploring or conferencing during the day I'd say give it a whirl."
20299,112764395,7/11/16,93382378,Susan, I found Edward to be very delightful and intelligent. As a woman I felt very safe and comfortable staying at his Airbnb. He gave me thorough instructions on how to navigate the subways which made my trip more enjoyable  and action-packed. My room was quiet. I had a good night sleep every night. I felt safe in the neighborhood  during the day and in the late evening. This location is close the subways with easy access to Manhattan touristy areas. I  would stay here again if I have a chance to come to New York again
20299,113673031,13/11/16,19746332,Richy B,"Edward is the reason you should stay here.   He is a very kind, trustworthy and wonderful host who loves intelligent conversation and is really into getting to know new people.   His apartment is perfect for those who want an affordable NYC stay in the East Village/Lower East Side.   It's also near the subway (F train - orange line) which made it easy to get around the city.  The neighborhood is endlessly fascinating; the apartment quite safe; the room nice and cozy; and the bed so comfortable that I slept like a baby every night.  If ever I do visit NYC, again, I would stay with Edward in a heartbeat!  "
20299,114587447,19/11/16,102098066,Jonghyun,"great stay! recommended! edward hosted very nicely. quite room, great place, and very safe. ask him where is good place in nyc. he knows all."

20299,122722882,25/12/16,57934999,Zena,"First of all, this is a great place to stay for budget travelers. If you want to stay in decent hotels or expect a nice & luxurious room, this is not for you ;) Location is almost a center of East Village and close enough to public transportation (tip: buy unlimited MTA card if you want to stay more than 4 days). You can find many local restaurants near from the house. 
Edward is really easy-going and nice. You can get a lot of tips from him and I'd recommend following most of them (you can't follow all of them I guess).   "
20299,126992821,15/1/17,44623252,Morgan,"Edward was amazing host - seriously knows everything about the city! Room is small but does the job, especially if you are just looking for a place to rest your head at night. Walking distance to tons of good food and bars, and trains. Would absolutely stay again!"

20299,140914835,1/4/17,62021923,Patsy,Edward is amazing. I was blown away by his friendliness and generosity. He really helped me find my way around. It was a treat to stay with him for a week!
20299,145207113,17/4/17,37173839,Mateo,"Edward is an amazing individual, there was no photo of the room so i was a little big scared, but actually turned out amazing. If you are searching for a bed and hospitality this is the best choice. Edward always offers to make your stay in the city a little bit better. Not a 5 star hotel, but a pretty nice place to stay. Whenever i come back i will repeat.

Edward es una persona majisima, sabe muchisimo de nueva york y sus calles, es un autentico explorardor urbano jajajajaa. Siempre te va a ayudar dandote direcciones o proponiendote cosas. Te da muchisima libertad con un respeto mutuo. No se quejo en ningún momento de absolutamente nada y fue todo muy cómodo, sin duda repito aquí la próxima vez que venga. Merece mas la pena un sitio así que un hotel de 5 estrellas, vives y sientes Nueva York"
20299,146969582,24/4/17,11843793,Wolfgang,"Edward was an excellent host - super friendly, welcoming, and knowledgable. He responded promptly to pre-trip inquiries and was there exactly when he said he would be for check-in. 
I was pretty much only there to sleep and it was exactly what I needed. Close to where I needed to be, easy to get to, and lots of great inexpensive food recommendations (I ate at more than half of them). When I'm back in the city, I'll be sure to check to see if his place is available, you can't beat it for price and location. "
20299,149286433,3/5/17,121599728,Kumiko,"立地もよく、ニューヨークに慣れている人にオススメです。
エドワードは、何でも詳しく教えてくれます。そして寛大で優しいです。
部屋は、可愛い個室です。
でも、共有空間もありますから、綺麗に利用できる人がよいと思います。"
20299,150635578,8/5/17,59261086,Cary,"This was my first visit to New York, and I loved It! Edward was the perfect host. He is passionate about his love of New York. He gave me all of the information needed for travel.
As a single female traveler, I felt safe. I will definitely recommend for anyone who wants to visit. 
Central location. I caught the subway every night to go to a different Broadway show. It was close to his apartment. 
I even had to call a couple of times when I got lost and he was more than willing to help."
20299,157749325,4/6/17,43442427,Ofir,"Edward is very nice and welcome person. He loves and knows New York like his palm. The house is small and very nice. The room is real private room with closing door. I recieved clean linen and blankets. Every morning we had good conversation of what is advised to do today.  
I can conclude my vןsit at Edward's house as very enjoyable and highly cost effective."

Most importantly, Edward is a great host! I would've been really lost without his endless advice and recommendations for food, cool stuff to see, how to group attractions and so on. I loved my stay here."

20299,194892449,17/9/17,5894982,Jean-François,"Le grand atout de ce logement est sa situation dans l'East Village et son calme. Il est facile de découvrir ce quartier à pied à partir de cet appartement, y compris en allant vers le West Village ou Chinatown. Nombreuses lignes de bus et de métro à proximité. Les conseils d'Edward sont excellents : il connaît tellement bien New York et aime profondément cette ville."
20299,201644038,8/10/17,142306899,Schuyler,Very friendly and is willing to give his knowledge of the city. Great place to stay and he cares about his guest.
20299,204321389,17/10/17,40820575,Natalee,"Edward was very nice and accomadating. I loved his stories and his caring nature. He seemed to truly care about my wellbeing and my situation. I am a woman travelling alone to a new place so I was a little scared but Edward made me feel safe. His little dog Lilly stole a huge part of my heart. So much so I wanted to take her home..haha. He really cares about animals and it shows. House is simple and small but room is fair size. The only thing that made me slightly uncomfortable was that if I had to go to bathroom during night I had to walk by his bed and it only made me uncomfortable cause I felt really bad bad for waking him. Although we were in close quarters, he made me feel welcome. I would definately stay with Edward again should I head back to New York. The apartment is a classic tenement building, or close to that era so you can feel the history as you walk in. If you are.looking for a 5 star this is not the place. But if you want to see real New York, you won't be disapointed. Thank you Edward :) till we meet again."
20299,214296764,25/11/17,5207109,Benoît,"Edward est un hote parfait, qui connait parfaitement NYC et donne de tres bons conseils. Il était très arrangeant. L'appartement est idealement situé pour visiter Manhattan et Brooklyn. Excellent rapport qualité prix."
20299,216593711,4/12/17,1987793,Carlo,"Airbnb as it used to be when it started out! You're not going to be staying at a hotel or some self catered facility, you're going to be staying with someone who has known NYC like the back of his hand for decades. Edward has seen his neighbourhood and the city at large change over the years. He's an incredibly articulate and interesting person and you will find yourself talking to him for hours about the city, politics, art, anything! I've been to NYC on dozens of different occasions, often for more than a week, but I still managed to appreciate his suggestions, that ranged from street food carts to the current exhibitions in town. Regarding the apartment, there is only one rule in NYC: location, location, location. You can't really go wrong with this. While the apartment itself is not big (what do you expect from NYC?!) your room will be fairly large. Oh, and the value is amazing!"
20299,223064744,31/12/17,156296612,Apoorva,"This place is at a great location, there are many famous New York restaurants around it and on top of that Edward is a great help if you are new to the city.

20299,243114605,14/3/18,174423594,Galina,The location of this apartment is in the east village with close by subway station. It is fantastic to explore Manhattan but also Brooklyn and Williamsburg since it’s in the south. The accommodation is very simple and basic. Edward is a friendly host who has a helpful knowledge about the city and is a great advisor also for the non tourist spots in Manhattan.
20299,247163163,27/3/18,175995685,Patrick,"If you come to Edward you get a guide and a friend, not just a room and a bed. He is a great guide. The price is amazing to have your own room in Manhattan. The place is someone's house, so don't expect it to be as neat as a hotel. Just be nice and you'll have a great time"
20299,249691509,2/4/18,121110687,Bastian,Edward is good host and knows the city in its details. He can provide you great advices for any trips.

There a all kinds of trains nearby, food and drink galore, and a cool ""buzz"" in the neighborhood. The room provided is small, but a comfortable bed is a huge plus (with two fans!)

Edward is fantastic, lays down the house rules, and gives you great ideas on where to go for food, fun, and sightseeing. He's a long time New Yorker, and his help was priceless."

私は近所の見どころを案内してもらいました。
エドワードは、とてもいい距離感を保ってくれます。

ニューヨークの古い建物なので、虫を見ることもあるかもしれませんが、それ以上に価値のある場所です"
20299,278099504,17/6/18,171973214,Andrew,Nicely priced place in a great location. Edward was super friendly and suggested tons of things to do in the area. He even let me check out later when he found out I had a late flight!
20299,285380079,3/7/18,16539831,Joseph,A very amenable and friendly host that allows you your own space. Great for tips and suggestions with the honesty of a native.  Engaged in many an interesting  chat and he's an articulate and receptive guy.  A great stay during a heatwave.
20299,288400275,9/7/18,106677345,Michael,I had a great stay in NYC as the location of the apartment is perfect to discover Manhatten and the other boroughs.

20299,300589615,2/8/18,13812454,Adriano,"Edward is a great guy! Very welcoming and always ready to give you very good advices !  The flat is smal andl simple,and also the room, who has a very little window. The room is hot (it's summer!) but Edward put two fans on the room, who helps a lot! And the room is quiet. It was a good time!  Thank you so much to Edward!"
20299,313616231,25/8/18,110165365,Alessandro,"Edward is a very kind and helpful host. He is very available to communicate with his guests and can provide great tips about places to visit in NY

The position of the house is very confortable to visit NY, different subways' lines are at close reach

The house is the perfect solution for whom needs a place to sleep and take a shower while visiting the City

Would come back again!"
20300,61079417,31/1/16,8288595,Jennica,"Staying at Pas's was an amazing experience! The room was spacious, his roommate was delightful and the location is perfect! We would highly recommend him! Thanks Pas!! :)"
20300,62374340,14/2/16,21912652,Farnosh,"As wonderful as the location was, we were extremely disappointed with the whole experience. From the beginning when I requested the reservation, I told Pas of our whole plan. We were taking the train in from CT and had an afternoon show, but we had bags we wanted to drop off beforehand. Pas explained to me that he would be out of town, but that his roommate Melanie would be there to let us in. After a ton of text messages back and forth with Melanie (2 hours before our arrival), she informed me that she would leave the apartment door open but we would have to get someone to let us into the building. This was not a good start to our stay. 

As soon as we got into the [fairly] clean room, my fiancé saw a huge stain on the comforter so he pulled it back, only to see crumbs on the sheets. We immediately called Melanie and kindly asked her to change our sheets out for clean ones; she assured us that she would. 

When we arrived back around midnight, we checked the sheets and it was obvious they were not cleaned. At the very most, they were thrown into a dryer to give off a clean smell. I went into the bathroom to wash my face and brush my teeth, and had to dry everything off with toilet paper. I do not expect to be provided any toiletries (although every Air BNB I have stayed at has), but at the very least a clean hand towel would have been nice! At that point, it was almost 12:30 am and we had a very long day, so we decided to just stick it out, even though we were ready to leave. 

Finally, the both of us were woken up by the dog barking at 2 am when one of the roommates got home. Not only that, but we could hear 2 people talking for about an hour until we finally fell asleep again. It's unfortunate to say, but we could not wait to get out of there in the morning. "
20611,30512,21/3/10,84208,Andrew,"I stayed in Lulu's place for one week with my girlfriend and I cannot fault it in any way. The location is perfect, in a great part of Brooklyn and close to the subway for access to the rest of the city. The apartment was spotless and decorated in a cool, modern style. As well as all that, Lulu is a friendly, funny and attentive host. I hope to stay again some day."
20611,33554,5/4/10,80381,Tomoko,"First of all, Lulu is a great lady as a host. She is so nice and friendly and organized her place for guest so well. When I went to get key for my friend, I thought I made right choice. Thank you Lulu, My friend was really happy and appreciate your hospitality. She wished she could speak English more. 
I highly recommend if someone visit NY and want to stay nice and great price!!!"
20611,39950,4/5/10,27987,Sandra,"My daughter and I stayed at Lulu,s place and we just loved it, great appartment, great location, love Williamsburg....but most off all loved Lulu...great host, warm, kind and friendly.

20611,41644,11/5/10,100896,Tove,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Lulus apartment for a week. It was perfect! Lulu is an amazing person with a great sense of humour. Her place is organized, clean, nicel decorated and in a wonderful location. It was our first time in New York and Lulu couldn't have been more helpful. What ever you do don't miss the opportunity to get to know this wonderful lady, her apartment and Williamsburg!"

20611,46766,27/5/10,106635,Anna,"Even though we only stayed for 4 nights we really felt like we lived there. The apartment was so homely, cared for and comfortable; Williamsburg had an awesome neighbourhood vibe and Lulu was an amazing host. Five stars aren't enough."
20611,56696,24/6/10,103131,Julien,"Lulu's flat is just perfect, super clean, very well organised and decorated. Located in a great neighbourhood with lots of nice bars, restaurants and shops. And most important Lulu is such a great host, very sweet and full of good advice. We had a wonderfull time and we'll surely stay at her place next time we'll go to NY."
20611,92054,7/9/10,192384,Josie,Lulu is the consummate hostess!  Great neighborhood with easy access to transit and a respite from the city (yet still super close).  Would highly recommend to friends and family!
20611,126273,25/10/10,163728,Natalie,"Lovely room in a cute little apartment. Excellent host, and fabulous location - so close to lots of great bars and restaurants in williamsburg!"
20611,129362,29/10/10,253569,Christian & Finlay,"The apartment is well situated, being just a few yards from Bedford Avenue and all it has to offer, and a 5 minute walk to a couple of subways that will take you straight to Manhattan in a matter of minutes. A spotlessly clean and tidy apartment, with some interesting books and other literature around that could enhance your visit. We had the larger of the two rooms and slept like proverbial logs, on a very comfortable bed. 
Lulu was an excellent host and helpful with ideas and suggestions when needed, so we have no hesitation in recommending the apartment to other visitors."
20611,144269,25/11/10,229207,Julia,"The flat is one cozy, clean and beatyful place in the best neighborhood in Brooklyn! Ginger was the perfect host! Thank you very much for everything :-)"
20611,146355,29/11/10,263342,Melody,"My fiance and I had an AMAZING time staying at Lulu & Ginger's apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The apartment was beautiful, clean and close to a ton of incredible cafes, thrift stores, bars, and two metro stops. I highly, highly recommend Lulu & Ginger as AirBnB hostesses! You won't find a more kind accomodating pair! 5 stars, absolutely! "
20611,161902,2/1/11,244279,Jonathan,"My girlfriend and I spend 3 nights in Lulu & Ginger's apartment. We were initially supposed to stay one more night, but our flight from Vegas to New York was cancelled because of the snow storm in NYC. I sent and email to Lulu and she was very understanding, accepting the reservation change of one day although she did not have to. Thank you again for that! The apartment itself was clean and cozy. Ginger took care of us, she was very quiet and always willing to help for our walks or visits. For the breakfast there were tee, milk, coffee and some bagels with butter. About the bedroom, the mattress was good but we could ear some noise from the street during the night. Maybe it's because we are used to live in the country but taxi drivers honk a lot in NYC! The bathroom is tiny but never ran out of hot water! Finally, this bedroom has a good value, very affordable compared to the hotels in Manhattan and not too far. We did not spend much time in Brooklyn so I can't tell you about the district! It was nice meeting Ginger, we wish we could had stayed a little big longer! "
20611,189990,28/2/11,363510,Daniele," We were at Ginger and Lulu's home for a few days.
 I was really fine. The home of Ginger and Lulu is tidy, very clean, convenient to downtown and is located in a wonderful neighborhood. Ginger was very welcoming and kind. He made us feel really at home.
 Too bad that the bathroom is so small and a bit uncomfortable but our stay was really great. I am pleased to be their guest. We also took advantage of yoga classes of Ginger. Excellent teacher!  Thanks! Daniele Salvo"
20611,224077,12/4/11,339388,Marleen,"Our stay with Lulù and Ginger was wonderful! The apartment is just as pictured, cozy, warm and super tidy and clean! Our bedroom, the (beautiful) master bedroom, had a super comfortable bed, and we fell asleep instantly every night!
The apartment is conveniently located between subway stations, one stop from Manhattan, and in a really lively neighbourhood. 
We had the luck of meeting both Ginger and Lulù, who was in from Kenya, and we had the most pleasant talks, and they advised us to best restaurants, Viva la arepas! :-) 
They also have plenty of travelguides, booklets and maps to make sure you make the most out of your stay.
We really hope to see them again, for sure whenever we go back to New York! Thanks a lot!!

20611,273923,21/5/11,580026,Nicole,"This was my first time booking a room through airbnb.com, and I found say that it was a truly wonderful experience.  Lulu & Ginger were extremely prompt when it came to the booking process and they provided me with very detailed and clear instructions on how to get to their home and let ourselves in.  My friend and I met Ginger (Lulu was not home) shortly upon arrival and I must say that she was extremely accommodating and very sweet.  

Overall the apartment was clean, vibrantly decorated and home-y.
The room itself was cozy and comfortable.  A huge bonus was the memory foam mattress!  We were mostly out and about during our 3-night stay so we unfortunately  didn't take advantage of the kitchen or the nice coffee/tea station that they had set up.

The apartment is conveniently located a few short blocks away from a subway stop and there are a ton of great restaurants and bars within walking distance.  

I hope to stay here again soon someday  :)"

We really fell on our feet :) We're looking forward to staying in the apartment on trip #2 to New York!"
20611,328251,22/6/11,562909,Jenni,We had a  very lovely stay. The apartment was peaceful and the neighborhood felt safe. The location was great and it was easy to get around. Our host Ginger was very nice and helpful.

20611,436184,11/8/11,566847,Jess,"Ginger's apartment in Brooklyn was amazing to say the least, an old style building with a modern interior. She was lovely and extremely helpful with any need we had during our stay. Williamsburg itself is a fantastic area with it's cafes and quirky stores. Would most definitely stay with Ginger again if ever in Brooklyn."
20611,455094,18/8/11,682333,Leah,"Ginger is a sweet and helpful hostess!  Lulu has set up a great home (she was off in Kenya when we were there - but even through email Lulu was kind and helpful!)  
We stayed in the bigger room with AC.  
The apartment is beautifully decorated.  Mostly Quiet except sometimes there was loud music playing in other apartments with whom we shared the courtyard (but this never happened at night),  inside our bedroom was quiet!  
The neighbourhood is amazing!  Walking distance to bars, restaurants, cafes and subway!
I would absolutely stay with Ginger and Lulu again!"

20611,691068,4/11/11,793965,Wayne,"nice comfy old nyc appt , ginger was a nice polite freindly host , who gave you your own space and privacy , location was good 5 mins walk to marcy av subway which is one stop from manhatten on the j train, the area looked a little unsafe at first but was fine , plenty of cheap eats near the subway station , plenty of people around even after midnight walking about so felt safe ect , note tho the appt is on the 5th floor so unsuitable for unfit or lazy people, the room was big enough , had the room facing the street very little noise really was surprised , the double bed was excellent and very comfy , bathroom very small and old but hey its not a hotel ,  all in all great stay would reccomend nice to stay in the real new york at a good price ,"
20611,840550,6/1/12,1182142,Anne-Lucie,The biggest room is really nice and confortable. The appartment is well placed and not far from 2 different metro lines. The kitchen is usefull. One thing that we didn't like : the bathroom is a little bit dilapidated and there is no washbasin so you have to brush your teeth is the  kitchen sink! Exept that it was a great time there ! 
20611,1114009,12/4/12,1766406,Eve,"Lulu and Ginger's accommodation was perfect. It was in a great location with very quick access to Manhattan as well. The apartment and our bedroom were lovely. The bed was so comfy! Lulu and Ginger were lovely to stay with and made us feel really welcome and relaxed. They gave us great tips on where to go and explore. Lulu made us a delicious chocolate pudding as well while we were staying :)
The accommodation and hosting could not have been better, I highly recommend staying with Lulu and Ginger in Williamsburg. "
20611,1148058,18/4/12,1782045,Alvin,The perfect base for exploring New York or just hanging out in Williamsburg.

"
20611,1254979,9/5/12,2198288,Lily,"The apartment is in a great location, their are good cafe's and fun stores nearby.   It was close to the subway, less then a 10 minute ride into the city.  Lulu and Ginger were great hosts, very accommodating of our late arrival time when we flew into NYC. "
20611,1479258,14/6/12,1687964,Unica,"Unfortunately the place was not what I had expected it to be. Yes, the room was nice (although very dusty) and I really don't mind brushing my teeth in the sink although I feel one should have the possibility to wash one's hands before one comes out of the bathroom. The reasons why I actually moved to some different accomodation was that I could not imagine to stay at a place where I cannot actually really use the toilet (it clogs so badly that one should actually not throw tolietpaper in there). Bedford Avenue is close and a nice street to stroll along but the house itself and especially the outside staircase is dilapidated and must have been neglected for a long time.     "
20611,1548579,24/6/12,2328466,Feben,"The Cozy Bedroom in Williamsburg was very nice, clean and comfy. Constance was a very friendly host. We really liked to stay in williamsburg because there are so many cute little shops and restaurants. If we would go again to New York (and we will!) will we definitely try to book the room again! "
20611,1593153,30/6/12,2172908,Denise,"Lulu's apartment is as it appears in the pictures -- a very warm and inviting place. The location was exactly what I was looking for -- a bit off the beaten path but situated close enough to the subway stations that I could get into Manhattan with ease. And Constance was a fine host. She was friendly, but also gave me and my traveling partner  space to do out own thing in the apartment. I especially appreciated Constance's help in guiding me to the apartment when i got lost on my way there. The only downside to the stay was the bathroom. As others have said, it is small and quite worn. The bathroom door doesn't lock and any toilet paper you use cannot be flushed away but needs to be thrown in the trash can. That said, Constance did a great job keeping the place clean and I appreciated the fact that we had the chance to stay in a real neighborhood, rather than a tourist area.
"
20611,1636600,5/7/12,2528628,Michael,Wonderful place right in the heart of Williamsburg. Couldn't have been nicer. 
20611,1688076,12/7/12,27987,Sandra,"Hello All,
This was our second time staying at Lulu's home and it was exiting for us to stay there again. We know and love the neighbourhood and we felt right at home.
Lulu is a great host and her appartment is a very nice and warm place to stay.

Thanks so much for having us again Lulu....we love youuuuu!!!!"
20611,1810596,27/7/12,2167141,Amanda,"We had a great time staying at Lulu's place. Lulu is a great communicator and very accommodating. The apartment is in a fantastic location, Williamsburg has a lot going on, and it's only one stop on the subway to Manhattan, with easy connections to other lines. The airconditioning was a total saviour, and Constance was a fabulous host. Any inconveniences (no sink in toilet, can't flush toilet paper) have been covered in the description and so there were absolutely no nasty surprises for us, plus they were really not a big deal anyway. Highly recommend this place!"
20611,1956473,12/8/12,2485249,Daniel,"It was a great room and luckily had air conditioning. We had an awesome stay, everything worked out as planned. The room was clean, the kitchen well equipped. Only the bathroom is not so nice and very small, but we knew that before so no surprise here. All in all great stay!"
20611,2204739,5/9/12,1849735,Clara,"I had a very pleasant stay in Lulu's apartment. It is wonderfully placed in Williamsburg close to lovely restaurants and bars and a short walk from the subway. The room was comfortable and larger than you are likely to get in Manhattan. As previous guests have said, the bathroom is a little small and the towel rail kept coming off the wall - but this really wasn't a problem for me. Lulu was a complete delight to deal with - very communicative and unfailingly helpful. Constance was very friendly too and made me feel at ease in the apartment. "
20611,4098624,9/4/13,1135362,Nicole,"Lulu's place was perfect for us.  It was clean and ideally located in the heart of south Williamsburg.  Although there were multiple guests, we didn't hear a single peep from them and thus slept quite well.  Lulu and her host Constance were both very responsive and accommodating in terms of picking up and dropping off keys.  The only small disadvantage of this place is that it's on the fifth floor and there's no elevator, so pack light or beef up before you come."
20611,5773419,15/7/13,7364315,Leonieke,"Because of Lulu, I will stay using AIRBNB forever! What a nice and warm host she is and the room was very fine. Couldn't be better."
20611,5944595,23/7/13,6822427,Eithne,"Lulu is a warm and friendly host with a well equippped, very well located apartment.  This colorful and clean apartment is full of indiosycrasies (including four flight walk up) which contribute to its charm."
20611,6672158,20/8/13,4471822,Mk,Lulu is very sweet and her place is cozy. She and her apartment have great energy. You could tell that she maintains the place and is concerned with her guests comfort. I didn't really stay at her apartment because I ended up staying with a friend that I ran into in New York but I would book Lulu's place again in a heartbeat. Speaking of heart beat...there are many many stairs but I guess that's New York. 
20611,6827115,26/8/13,3535017,Thomas,"It's a tough one... The apartment in itself is really nice, it's in an old building in the heart of Williamsburg. It's well situated too, just a 5 mn walk from the metro, and then a 15 mn ride to Manhattan. And even though I only met Lulu very briefly, she seems like a very nice and friendly person. I had a really pleasant stay overall.

But, unfortunately, there's one downside : this place had roaches when I stayed there. Even though Lulu assured me it was because of recent construction works in the apartment below (and I totally believe her) I would advise travelers to exercise caution before renting there."
20611,7033687,4/9/13,5474275,Bettina,Lulus place was just wonderful and made us feel at home in a great neighbourhood! Lulu is a great host and a extremely nice person.

The hosts were helpful and friendly. The location is great, a short walk to a range of fun eateries and a subway stop. Would most definitely stay here again!"
20611,7977749,11/10/13,6863363,Amalie,"Perfect location in Williamsburg. We stayed in the bigger room which was very good and it was nice and clean. The apartment was charming and had all the basics, it wasn't fancy and new, but it matched our expectations. Over all a really good experience."

It´s perfect located in Williamsburg near the subway. We stayed in the bigger room which was big enough, nice and clean. The apartment has everything we needed. Just the bathroom is very, very small and a little old.
If we will come back to New York again, we would really like to stay there a second time. Thank you very much, Lulu and Constance!!!"

20611,10147778,3/2/14,10573932,Mike,"I personally would not recommend my stay at this location, largely due to my communications in dealing with the apartment owner.  That being said, many others seem to have had positive experiences.  Below are my pros and cons:

Pros:
* Decent location, not too far from public transport
* Apartment and room was tidy
* Live-in apartment managers were friendly and accommodating (helped take out our recycling after we flattened the boxes)

Cons:
* Very negative experience dealing with owner - particularly in regards to pre and post stay communications 
* Very noisy apartment/thin walls - offered little privacy
* Very sub-par bathroom facilities (rusty tub, no sink to brush teeth, etc in bathroom - had to do all washing up in kitchen sink)
* Have a washing machine, but no dryer - kind of defeats the purpose
* Very dirty common areas of the building and other people's comments regarding cockroaches and giant bottle of Raid in the apartment was unsettling

Lastly, if you are intending on booking the entire place, be very clear in your request.

Two subway stations nearby, Marcy & Bedford. Marcy if you prefer the shortest walk home, Bedford if you prefer a walk along hipster boutiques and cozy coffee bars.

If you want to, it is easy to cook lunch/dinner and make breakfast in the kitchen (but there is also a really nice bagel place one block away... :)) All in all, the room we stayed in was big enough for two persons with quite a lot of luggage and I would gladly stay here again! We bought a metro card and it was easy to travel to Manhattan with the L train (and also with some other train from another station which I don't remember the name of)"
20611,14773112,26/6/14,13090230,Mirela,"We really enjoyed staying in Lulu's flat! It's clean, cozy and colorful place. Only problem that we had was with towels. When we arrived, we didn't know which are ours and there were a few, still wet towels in living room. Otherwise, everything was ok. Location and neighborhood are great, just a few minutes interesting walk from L subway and there is a plenty things to do and experience in Williamsburg. We'll come back for sure..."

20611,16031320,20/7/14,6433130,Isabelle,"Lulu's apartment looks charming and cute and was in just the right neighborhood. It delivered on all counts, not to mention Lulu is AMAZING... wow what a powerhouse intelligent well-traveled woman. She's one-of-a-kind. So first, count yourself lucky Lulu is your host! Lots of attention to detail - from the welcome letter, towels, and tea/coffee bar she has, to her personal recommendations of where to eat and what to do. My only caveat is that we were carrying a lot of luggage/equipment this visit, and her 5-floor walk-up wiped us both out each time we came home at the end of the day. No elevator; pretty normal for NYC though. I didn't ask or warn her either and it definitely says 5-floor walkup in the description, so it's totally my bad. With no bags, it's totally doable. The apt was ultra-clean too by the way - and quiet, great street view, a few steps from Bedford ave and lots of great little places. Stay here! She's amazing, the place is amazing, you'll have a great time :) "

We're so glad we picked the Williamsburg Sweetie to stay in while we were in New York. First a couple of things about the room, flat and location. 
The room was larger than I expected with an air conditioner which was such a bonus considering how unseasonably hot it's been. 
The flat was gorgeous, well appointed and felt safe and secure. It also, awesomely, had a washing machine we were free to use (although we forgot about this, whoops). 
We were close to everything; Bedford Ave, the Williamsburg Bridge, Marcy Avenue station and the M line. Great views from the roof and great food everywhere! 

Now on to Lulu, we could not have asked for a better host! She was so friendly and made us feel really welcome. She had loads of useful recommendations for things to do, as well as great travelling tips for getting around. Thanks so much Lulu, it was a pleasure to stay with you!

20611,19674105,16/9/14,12909270,Keri,"Stay with Lulu!!!  Her place is located in a perfect part of Williamsburg; close to two subway locations and perfectly placed next to Bedford Avenue, which is lined with the best boutiques, coffee shops and restaurants.  This is a great location to experience both the city and Brooklyn!  The apartment is warm and inviting.  The bedroom was clean, bed was comfortable and provided ample space for all of our shopping acquisitions.  Lulu was the best; attentive to our questions about the city, helpful with any household needs and none the less such a wonderful host!  We will be back to Brooklyn to stay here!"
20611,20417674,29/9/14,2482631,Maia,"We spent two weeks in the biggest room of Lulus' apartment. 
The room is located on the 5th floor of a Brooklyn's traditional bulding of the twenties. 

Williasmburg is a great neighborhood, very pleasant to live in, and is full of local markets and shops. The transportation is very convenient: just few block from the house there are two Metro stations which lead to Midtown and Downton Manhattan in 15 minutes.

The apartment is very nice and clean. Lulù was a caring and discreet guest  always ready to give you advice (Thank you again :-). "
20611,20643028,3/10/14,17564847,Ellen,"We had such a wonderful time at Lulu's Cozy Bedroom! Lulus wasn't there, when we arrived, but arranged everything very well, so we could easily come in her apartment. When we met her, we were so keen on her heartiness, her generosity and her humor: whenever she was there, we talked and laughed a lot and in this way Lulu made us feel home immediately. The Cozy Bedroom and the bathroom are small but have everything you need and it's clean everywhere. The location is almost perfect (the subway is close and you are in Manhattan in less than half an hour) and Williamsburg itself is an interesting, vivid district and worth visiting. We definitely recommend Lulu and her Cozy Bedroom to everyone who wants to stay at a great place in New York City."
20611,21036914,10/10/14,13900923,Frederic,"Nus avons passé une semaine chez LuLu. 
Appartement conforme à la description.
LuLu a été parfaite. Nous donnant de précieux conseils.
La chambre et la literie était top Cela peut devenir un petit peu bruyant mais sans conséquences fâcheuses.
C'est bien placé a un quart d'heure de deux lignes de metro.
idéal pour visitez NY et dormir dans un quartier super comme Williamsburg !
Je recommande !"
20611,21459278,18/10/14,5362741,Elena,"Everything was so perfect: the room, the all apartment, the neighborhood and...Lulu!!! She is so funny and kind with a very contagious laugh! If needed, she will be present and helpful for everything, info on the subway and the best ways to reach places you want to see, good suggestions on restaurants and brunch, lovely places to visit, nice things going on in the neighborhood. She makes you feel the Williamsburg mood and a Home atmosphere at the same time.
The room and the apartment are as you can see in the pictures, beautiful, cozy and clean with few but smart rules which make the cohabitation pleasant.
The neighborhood is great too with nice shops, good restaurants and mini market, bars and pubs...even a good tattoo studio around the corner if you need :D It's perfect for spending dinner time after the day walking in Manhattan. 
SUCH  A GREAT TIME AND GOOD VIBES THERE, I HOPE TO COME BACK SOON!!!"
20611,21898984,26/10/14,4161940,Benoit,"Our stay at Lulu's place was awesome !! The neighborhood is full of restaurants and bars, the appartement is so clean and Lulu is the nicest host we got. She is very organized. She lets your privacy but she always there if you need an advice for a place to eat or to go. She speaks english and spanish. What else ? I give her 5 stars and for sure, we will back at her place the next time we go to new york. Gracias por todo Lulu !!"
20611,22760771,14/11/14,21208739,Essi,"Lulú's cozy apartment was even better than we expected! It was located in a good neighborhood just one subway stop away from Manhattan. There were nice restaurants in the area and we went to one of them recommended by Lulú. It was our first time both in New York and using Airbnb and thanks to this great experience we will surely come back. Could absolutely imagine staying at Lulu's place again!
Lulú is really friendly and helpful and made sure that we had everything ok. We didn't meet her but we kept in contact by email and everything went smoothly :)"
20611,23323429,29/11/14,14100517,Barbara,"Lulu's place is the best!!  Great location right in the heart of Williamsburg, very close to Manhattan and I felt very safe in the neighborhood. 
The apartment is clean, cozy and has anything you might need... this Airbnb experience was just perfect. 
I've actually spent almost an entire month there, so I felt pretty much at home till I left this afternoon. I can't really image coming back to NYC and staying some place else. 
Lulu was an amazing host from the beginning, helping us with our questions, giving us tips and always responded swiftly. 
Cleuci, the apartment manager, was also great. From the moment I got there, she made me feel at home. 
I would definitely recommend the place... Unless you want to stay there at my next travel dates to NYC, then please get away from my room. lol :P
Thank you for everything, Lulu and Cleuci. You helped make this month an amazing one. :) "
20611,23680942,8/12/14,21704004,Julia,"Lulu's place made me feel home. It was my first experience with the Airbnb and I sure loved it. The place is small, but very cozy. The apartment had many magazines and books about NYC and it was very handy to help us plan what would be our plans for the next day.

Although it is not really a weak point for me, the apartment is on the fifth floor with no elevator, so be prepared to work out a little everyday, especially if you are coming home after a day shopping.

In the overall, I really enjoyed staying at Lulu's. The atmosphere was great, the other guests were very nice and we managed to have interesting discussions with them. It was a very pleasant first airbnb experience and I recommend the place to everybody."
20611,23992392,16/12/14,22130487,Xue,The price is reasonable and its convenient. It only cost 5 minutes walking to subway and only one stop to Manhattan.The room is clean and quiet.
20611,25148089,7/1/15,6723622,Monique,"Lulu was a pleasure to deal with and although she was not in town at the time of my stay, she was super efficient at communicating. 

The apartment is located in a great spot! It is at the beginning of Bedford Ave; a nice street to walk, eat, shop and catch the subway. We also walked home from Manhattan over the Williamsburg Bridge.  

The apartment was as described; simple yet cosy. It was extremely clean!!! We stayed in the front guest room; the bed was comfortable (mattress was foam) and the shared bathroom includes a toilet and bath/shower (the basin is shared in the kitchen).

Overall a good experience and great value for money!"
20611,25445949,16/1/15,5356061,Usman,"Lulu' place is a lovely old Brooklyn building. Her manager Claire lives on the property and does everything she can to help out. I didn't have internet for a day and she bent over backwards for hours on the phone to get it back online. If you're tall like I am the bathroom might be a little cramped for you, and the sink is in the kitchen, but I think most people under 6' should be fine. 
Plenty of heat in the cold NYC weather and the place was very homey. A great place to live if you don't mind a 5th floor walk up. 
Lulu is also very accessible through airbnb and gets back to you very quickly. Had a comfortable stay."
20611,26779610,19/2/15,13897565,Camilla,"Lulu is very organised and she made everything so clear before we came. The description was accurate and it looked similar to the pictures. We had lots of space to store our stuff. 
We liked the neighbourhood, lots of cool cafes, bars and shops and we went to a few of the places that Lulu suggested. We felt safe walking around at night and it wasn't hard to find the subway.

"
20611,27121627,26/2/15,22361664,Carina,"Lulu's place is lovely and very cosy. The room was clean, the bed comfortable and we didn't have anything to complain about. 
As others already wrote, the bathroom is very tiny, but even for us (we are both very tall) was it still ok to use. 
We had free coffee or tea and towels which was nice. 
Unfortunately we didn't meet Lulu in person, because she wasn't in the US during that time, but her apartment manager Claire took care of us. She was so nice and helpful with everything. She even took us out the first night for some drinks, which was very cool. 
The neighborhood is just perfect. You get very quickly to Manhattan but at the same time you live in a very hip area that offers  everything you need. Hip bars, cafes, shops, galleries and restaurants. 
We definitely enjoyed our stay at Lulu's place and we would recommend it for sure! 
And because there are two rooms, that can be booked with airbnb, you are able to meet other travellers and people from all around the world, which is awesome, too. 
Thank you for letting us feel so welcome. We will be coming back again when its warmer in NY :)"
20611,27835232,13/3/15,7789308,Pierre,"Lulu et Claire (son apartment manager) se sont montrées très prévenantes et disponibles pour organiser notre arrivée à l’appartement et s’assurer que notre séjour se déroulait bien.

Le logement est tel que décrit dans l’annonce, très propre et fonctionnel. Pour ceux qui ont le sommeil sensible, la chambre donne sur la rue, mais cela n’est pas gênant avec une bonne paire de boule quies.

Comme indiqué dans d’autres commentaires, il n’y a pas de lavabo dans la salle de bain, mais cela n’est pas très gênant pour un séjour de quelques jours.

Le quartier est très sympa (beaucoup de restaurants, bars, …) et bien desservi par le métro qui permet de rejoindre facilement Manhattan. "
20611,30122920,18/4/15,23986799,Maialen And Davide,"The house was really nice,everything was clean and tidy and the neighborhood is just amazing. Lulu wasn't there so Claire welcomed us and has been really helpful, we stayed there for 9 days and we enjoyed every moment."
20611,30764299,27/4/15,5631497,Annemarie,"Es war sehr gemuetlich in Lulus Wohnung und wir haben uns sehr wohl gefuehlt. Eine ruhige Wohngegend und nah zur Subway, sind gute Voraussetzungen für einen Besuch in Big Apple."
20611,32739480,21/5/15,23727184,Josine,"Our stay at Lulu's place was great! The room was cozy and comfortable and Jnah, the apartment manager was very welcoming. He took us out for drinks and showed us good places to eat. the location is great, next to Bedford av, which is files with nice restaurants and cafe's and close to the subway (L and M train stations nearby) Overall we had an amazing time in New York, and I would definitely return to Lulu's place!"
20611,33666353,31/5/15,5440343,Daryl,"Our stay was stress-free and hugely enjoyable, thanks to Lulu's attention to detail and her warm & exuberant spirit. We loved her clean, charming and authentic Brooklyn pad and our 3 nights were very comfortable. It was always fun to cross paths with Lulu as we all came & went, and share stories of our daily travels. She gave us fantastic suggestions for restaurants & attractions in the area. We'd stay with her again in a heartbeat."
20611,34957785,14/6/15,31539339,Glenn,"Our stay with Lulu was wonderful! It was our first time using Airbnb and she left a great first impression! We chose to request a stay with Lulu based on her glowing reviews and photos of her space, and our experience didn't disappoint. She made her home feel like our home for a few days and always greeted us with enthusiasm and suggestions to make our trip more authentic. Cozy room, safe and accessible neighborhood, and a perfect host! I highly recommend a stay with Lulu! "
20611,36193977,26/6/15,33639660,Jenny,"Lulu was lovely - very helpful and friendly. Everything was as described - the apartment is neat, clean, very organised and comfortable. Location is great - about 5-10min walk to train station, so about 20 mins to Manhattan. Lulu was available if needed, and had good advice and information. We definitely recommend staying there. Thanks Lulu!"
20611,36521304,29/6/15,9747258,Julia,"We loved our stay at Lulu's Williamsburg apartment - amazing location, very comfortable apartment with everything we needed and lulu was a very generous and accommodating host. She made our stay a breeze. Will definitely stay again next time we're in NYC. Thanks Lulu!"
20611,37296077,6/7/15,7884502,Marrit,"Great cozy apartment in a lovely neighborhood in NY. Lulu is such a welcoming person, we truly felt at home. The room had a comfortable bed and airconditioning. The kitchen is well equiped to have a nice breakfast in the morning. There is one bathroom to share with another airbnb room, but we did not had any inconvenience concerning that. I would really recommend this place to anyone. the apartment is super cute and has everything you need and the neighborhood is full of nice bars and restaurant with metro stations close by. Thanks Lulu!"
20611,38479605,16/7/15,13290831,Acushla,"- Although the building looks a bit run down, Lulu's apartment is clean, colourful, and beautifully furnished. Our room was spacious and the air conditioner worked. The kitchen was large and well equipped, and we frequently cooked.
 - Williamsburg is an awesome neighbourhood. There are a plethora of restaurants, cafes, and bars, a ""flea food market"" (Smorgasburg) every Saturday, vintage clothing stores, and an excellent bookstore (Spoonbill and Surgartown). The apartment is in walking distance of two large supermarkets (Foodtown and Harvest) and two train stations (Bedford Av on the L line and Marcy Av on the J, M and Z lines). Finally, there are some nice parks by East River with views of Manhattan.
 - Lulu was an outstanding host. She was extremely generous and went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and enjoying our time in Brooklyn. This even extended to helping set up a dental appointment during a minor dental emergency!
- We absolutely recommend staying with Lulu if you are staying in Brooklyn. "
20611,41723038,9/8/15,23220826,Amanda,Our stay at Lulu's was perfect and without complaint. She was there to greet us warmly and we felt at home straight away. The room is larger than I expected with heaps of space for luggage - and we had a lot! The air conditioning was amazing and welcome relief after our long hot days walking around NY. Special note to her brand new bathroom - the shower is amazing! Thanks Lulu for an awesome week.

The area (Williamsburg) is an awesome place to ""live"" when visiting NYC. The places to eat which Lulu recommends in her welcome booklet are great! (Definitely try the ""steak & egg breakfast"" in the Rabbithole :)). "

20611,47146032,16/9/15,2394624,Syed,"Lulu was truly an amazing host during our stay. Even though the building/apartment is old and quite a walk up with our luggage (we missed that little bit before confirming our stay), it was well decorated, cozy and it felt a lot like home. And oh! I REALLY LOVE the roof of the building, BEAUTIFUL! 

The area has nice cafe's, shops, a grocery store and if you were to walk a little further, you have my personal favorite, the thrift stores. As mentioned by Lulu during our stay, the area is generally safe and we didn't feel at any moment threatened but of course, we still took necessary precautions. People there do their own thing and are generally nice and helpful.

If I do ever come back to New York, Lulu's would be the first I'd look for, even with a heavy luggage and the walk up.

Lulu's beautiful, colourful Brooklyn home was warm and inviting, with Lulu waiting up to welcome us in despite our late flight. She was bubbly, friendly, and more than happy to help recommend anything that we needed. She was happy to give us complete space, or chat in the kitchen if we wanted. 

The house is lovely. Beautiful, clean, remodelled bathroom. Light and clean room with a memory foam mattress on the bed. It's in a fantastic location just 5 mins walk from the station (L line to Manhattan) with some excellent bars and restaurants around). We always felt completely safe at all times in the neighbourhood. 

Finally, we had a particularly special trip, where we became engaged in NYC! Lulu greeted the news like she had been our friend for years and offered the most amazing recommendation for a jewellers. As such we were able to leave NY with a new ring to go with the memories. 

We will definitely be staying here again if we come through New York, and will recommend it to all our friends!"

The apartment is very clean, bright, very well-located and in compliance with the photos. Williamsburg is so cool ! We used the subway (Bedford station) to reach Manhattan and it was very easy !! We highly recommand this cosy bedroom and we hope to come back !

Even though Lulu was not in the apartment, she answered our e-mails quickly (both before and during our stay). While we were staying, she wrote us to see if everything was going OK. All in all she was a really attentive and caring host.

The apartment is cozy and charming. However there was no cleaning during our stay (8 nights).

The apartment manager got home three nights in a row around 3 a.m. and was either noisy himself or had brought noisy guests. We were woken by him/them all three nights, and this will (unfortunately) affect our final evaluation."

Great location of the appartment to get to know the neighbourhood, as well as travel to Manhattan. Lulu was easy to communicate with. We got all the info we needed. Although she wasn't there herself, she had an appartment manager to welcome us. We also had a nice room, with a good matress. You only have to be used to some noice of upstair neighbours or from the street, but nothing we couldn't cope with. "
20611,71569811,26/4/16,21367107,Hans,Very nice apartment. I recommend everyone to go there. Easy to go to Manhattan. There were 5 people staying there. Cleaning is just once every weak. So the bathroom is not clean anymore after a few days. Very good communication by Lulu.

Lulu hat sich sehr um uns bemüht. Sie hat uns alles persönlich gezeigt und erläutert wie was zu handhaben ist. Obwohl das Gebäude von Aussen nicht wirklich den Anschein macht: die Wohnung ist wirklich cozy, sauber und sehr gut ausgestattet. Einzig zu berücksichtigen: die Wohnung hat sich im 5. Stock befunden. Falls jemand Mühe hat mit Treppen steigen, so könnte dies zum Problem werden, da es keinen Lift hat und die Stufen sehr klein sind. 

Ansonsten: wir würden sofort wieder nach Williamsburg zu Lulu kommen. Herzlichen Dank!"

She is a really nice person, always reachable (even, if necessary, late at night) and more than friendly.  The room ist exactly how discribed and there is even a person that cleans it at least once a week. The house is old and looks a bit like it, but the neighborhood is really nice and we always felt safe and very welcomed. Especially the rooftop is really cool.  Feels a bit like Berlin - Kreuzberg :-)
You can reach the subway in an about 10min walk and after only one station you are in Manhattan. 

We can kindly reccomand to stay at Lulus place! If we come back to New York, we will be there again. "

20611,105071652,30/9/16,9755822,Cássio,"Me and my girlfriend stayed 2 weeks in Lulu's apartment and I'm sure this made the difference during our trip. Her location is perfect for those who are looking forward to explore Brooklyn or Manhattan because it's located in the heart of Williamsburg, nearby the metro lines L, M, J and Z (less than 5 minutes walking to the Bedford Av or Marcy stations then one or two stops from Manhattan) and so we were hanging out the whole day and didn't take a cab besides from the airport . Also you got everything you need close to the building: pharmacies, groceries, ATM, bakeries, bars, restaurants, medical center etc.
Lulu provides all the kitchen facilities and the washing machine for the guests. The bedroom was quite clean and cozy with AC / Heater, pillows and bed sheet were really comfortable as well. The bathroom is in the common area but it was Always clean! By the way Lulu's got a cleaner twice a week who helps to keep the place organized.
I've got say that Lulu is the kind of person that you meet and just a few minutes later looks like she's an old friend. She is absolutely helpful and friendly, helped us with many tips and if you need she answers texting really quick.
I'm looking forward for the next trip to NYC and for sure I'll try to book her flat again. I definitely recommend her airbnb."
20611,107940554,13/10/16,5301748,Mathieu,"We enjoyed a lot our stay at Lulu's place! Perfect place to enjoy the town.
Williamsburg is awesome. You've got all you need in the apartement and Lulu had let us a very helpfull guide to enjoy our stay and to understand the rules of the common life. 
Tynneal (The apartement manager) was very friendly (thanks for your yummy apple pie ! ^_^). The only downside is that you don't want to leave!!! We want to go back!
Tynneal you're welcome if you wanna visit France !

20611,109728438,23/10/16,5050097,Marietta,"We loved the flat and our room (main room) at Lulu's place. The location is great for exploring Williamsburg and getting into Manhattan. Because of the subway It's actually easier to get to Manhattan from this place than it is to Bed-Stuy or Bushwick (if you're interested in exploring those areas). Overall Brooklyn is an amazing place and Lulu's location is excellent. 

Tynneal, the apartment manager, was lovely: super friendly and had great suggestions for things we could check out.  And Lulu, who was away at the time, was great at keeping in touch via email/AirBnB messenger to make sure everything was working out for us.

There were other people staying in the guestroom, but never any clashes with bathroom times etc. though the floorboards throughout are a bit noisy so you will definitely hear them moving around, but it's not anything to worry about unless you're a reeeeaaaaally light sleeper! 

The place is immaculately clean, and very tidy, but also homely and we cooked breakfast once or twice which saved a bit of cash. 

Would definitely recommend people this place to anyone looking to visit New York. Fell in love with the area.

Thanks again Lulu, hopefully we'll be back!

20611,110632007,27/10/16,40346029,Lom,"Lulu's place was a really nice spot to stay in NYC. The room was nice and spacious, especially by new york standards and the place as a whole is very homely and I loved the character of it. The laundry facilities were handy too!

The location was convenient with quick access to 2 subway lines, particularly the JMZ for either heading into Manhatten or access to JFK. Really love the neighbourhood too, Southaide of Williamsburg has retained some character with all the gentrification in the area.

Lulu was out of town, however communication was very good and Tynneal, her apartment manager, was super friendly and great for a chat or any pointers. I'd stay again in a heartbeat."
20611,113389328,12/11/16,2756465,Mathilde,"Lulu's flat is really well situated to visit Manhattan and Brooklyn and really cute. The flatmate Tynneal is lovely. 
We had a good time in NY 
Many thanks "
20611,115068399,21/11/16,5619318,Josee,"Stay away from Manhattan's tourists traps and live Williamsburg. Right next to Bedford Avenue, Lulu's apartment offers a welcoming experience. Strongly recommend."
20611,117069684,4/12/16,17369252,Itahisa,"Elegir la casa de Lulu para quedarnos en nuestra visita a Nueva York ha sido un gran acierto. Muy fácil acceso a Manhattan con varias líneas de metro que hay a unos minutos caminando. Barrio tranquilo y muy animado con bastantes comercios a los alrededores para cualquier cosa que necesites. Si regresamos a la ciudad, no dudaremos en volver a casa de Lulu. "

Sin duda volveríamos! "
20611,126270007,10/1/17,27926605,Telman,"Location is very convenient, only five minutes to 2 subway stations.
Communication with host was also good.

But I'd notice that we staid in winter time here and with my gf in one room at the same time in two other rooms were also tenants. So it looked kinda like a hostel with so many people at the Appartmrnt.
It's cold apartment, it's an old building (100+y), noise from streets and noise from warming batteries will not you let to sleep well (used earplugs).
I'd not stay here again."

The apartment is clean, cozy and well stocked and I was lucky enough to have some great people staying in the other rooms whilst I was there. 
I'd love to stay here again the next time I visit New York - highly recommended."

Die Wohnung selbst ist toll ausgestattet und die Küche läd zum kochen und verweilen ein. Die Umgebung und das Haus verdienen das Prädikat ""orginal Brooklyn"" und das frei zugängliche Dach bietet einen tollen Blick über die Stadt, inklusive Blick auf die Skyline von Manhatten. 

Nach einer Woche fühlten wir uns bereits wie echte Williamsburger inklusive Stammlokal und Lieblings-Deli...

Jederzeit wieder. .."
20611,218400304,12/12/17,17354808,Camille,"Nous avons passé un bon séjour chez Lulu. Il y a trois chambres qui sont loués donc il faut accepter de partager les espaces communs avec des inconnus. Les chambres ne ferment pas à clé.
Mais l'appartement est idéalement situé, à un arrêt de métro de Manhattan."
20611,220091732,20/12/17,9669802,Jason,"Lulú's apartment is everything claimed. A cozy, but comfortable, room in a fifth floor walk-up (pace yourself!). The neighborhood is fun with lots of great options for food, drinks, and party. Yet, it's just far enough off Bedford that it has a quiet Brooklyn neighborhood feel with an old-school family vibe. The bed in this room is comfortable and the windows offer fresh air and nice morning light. The apartment is comfortably furnished and well-appointed. The towels were nice- clean and fluffy. We didn't need it but the washer and dryer is a nice luxury in a NY apartment. The tap water was good to drink and the shower is hot fast. I definitely recommend staying here."
20611,222336340,29/12/17,45120396,Yvonne,"A comfortable and cozy appartment with its own special style. There is everything you need and the details of your stay are organised in advance with the host giving fast answers and making sure everything is okay. 
We definitely recommend staying here."
20611,257555957,26/4/18,5169653,Vincent,"Superbe appartement, bien equipe, tres lumineux et idealement situe au coeur de williamsburg. A noter cependant que depuis notre chambre nous entendions beaucoup le bruit de la rue (mais peut etre pas plus que dans les autres appartements new yorkais ?) Lulu est tres reactive, toujours a disposition et l organisation de notre arrivee / depart a ete tres simple.
Bref, nous recommendons vivement ce lieu pour une visite de New York depuis Brooklyn."
20611,267356922,21/5/18,52368473,Brenden,"Great place to stay for exploring New York City. The apartment was clean and the bedroom was comfortable. The Williamsburg neighborhood by itself has a ton to do and explore, places to eat, and its own unique vibe. It took almost no time at all to walk to the nearest subway station and Manhattan was only one stop away which was awesome. The place is located in an awesome spot for exploring and for transportation, we loved it. Lulu is a phenomenal host, she provided a number of recommendations for places to eat, and she was very quick to respond to any questions we had. 5/5 stars would stay again."

20724,9720659,6/1/14,9757125,Tyler,"This is a nice place in a central location in Brooklyn.  Getting around the city is easy because there is a train stop just a couple of blocks away from the house.  Augustin was not in town when my friend and I stayed here, but the roommates were very helpful, and friendly.  They were able to answer questions about getting around, and places to go in the city.  The roommates took us out with them on New Years Eve, and we had a good time.  Everyone living there is either an artist or musician, and they create a nice community.  The house itself has a large communal area, and a large kitchen.  For the most part the house was clean, but like most homes with a few roommates it is not perfectly clean.  The bedroom is large, but has a low ceiling.  There is a dog and a couple of cats, all of which are very friendly.  My friend and I had a great time, and we would def. stay here again."
20724,20876051,6/10/14,6839682,Andy,"Super lovely place - is as exciting-looking as the photos suggest. It's very close to the subway as well, which is useful for getting into Manhattan or elsewhere in Brooklyn. Didn't meet Augustin as he was away but his (Hidden by Airbnb) seemed friendly. "
20724,21986019,27/10/14,22303884,Casey,"I had an amazing time in NY and coming home at the end of the night to this chill loft was a major plus. The pictures definitely do the place justice. The roommates in the house were all really nice and welcoming. Nearby delis open late into the night kept me fed. The subway was only a few minutes walk away, so my commute into Manhattan and DUMBO were made really simple.

If you're chill and looking for a cool Brooklyn place, you should be happy with this place."

20724,52767874,1/11/15,24723889,Jessie,"Amazing artsy apartment in my favourite part of Brooklyn. I didn't stay in this room due to a mix up, but I did stay in two different rooms in this place and both were comfortable, big, spacious and perfect for my NYC stay. Would recommend to any one. Conveniently located really close to the Flushing Ave train stop. I would recommend to any one coming to this big city to stay here!!  "
20724,62369249,14/2/16,52679551,Chiara,"What's your idea of cool loft in the heart of Brooklyn? Well, this place is exactly What you mean. The room is very spacious, like the living room, where sometimes movies are projected on the wall, the kitchen and the bathroom. All the loft is very sunny and fool of art pieces.  The position is perfect cause the subway stop is at two streets close, so very confortable, with two lines. The roommates are all very kind and helpful And a cool fact is that in every moment of the day there is someone with have a talk. Place super suggested, when I'll return in New York I'll return here for sure!"

20724,91378137,5/8/16,23472755,Peter,"The space is in a great location. The warehouse is huge and great to hang out in. The room is not as sunny or as open and clean as the pictures show and the ceiling is actually quite low meaning there is a lot of ducking that needs to be done. But the bed is super comfortable. The check in process was tough as Augustin could not be home till 10pm, he did give us a contact of his housemate who we could contact. We contacted his housemate and left a voicemail, which he did not receive, and then we did not hear anything back from Augustin or his housemate. We arrived leisurely and luckily his housemate had gotten home and was cleaning the room for our arrival. "
20724,98578043,31/8/16,31197737,Bonny,"I never met the host but his housemate John was a real star, Mark and Kurt were also super helpful. Lots of intelligent conversations around the huge kitchen table, live music and a great atmosphere. This is the neighborhood where Grandmaster Flash roamed in 1977 and the Opening Scene from French Connection ends. It feels more like recognizing than discovering. Great place. If you like interesting people and places, gritty culture and creativity: Go!"

20724,123946107,31/12/16,83831224,Elisabeth,"Great for Short-term stays.

Great artist loft, with some cool people there.  

However, a couple of the roommates were quite territorial and appeared to be aspiring bullies, completely disrespecting other people's space and items, rather than stating if there was some type of issue.  The fridge was a complete sh*t show, with everyone eating everyone else's food, moving it around, throwing it out, and idk what else - brand new items would completely disappear.  

Basically, a couple of bad apples brought down the ambiance of a great space for everyone else."
20724,149497647,4/5/17,7455665,Dee,"Awesome for a short stay, huge open communal spaces, low ceilings in room and only a canvas as a door to room didn't bug me! Most of the roommates were chill and accommodating, Kurt even helped me bring my huge bag up a few flights of stairs! I did have a couple weird interactions w/ a couple of the roommates when I was taking a few pictures in the awesome space w/ a photographer buddy...perhaps territorial of their home and my towel oddly disappeared from the bathroom. Other than that I enjoyed my stay!"

En resumen el mejor sitio para pasar unos días en NY."

20734,38333495,14/7/15,25411796,Rose,"Sean and Lynette where perfect hosts. They were more than welcoming for our arrival. The flat was immaculate and was exactly as described. It was perfect for my 3 friends and I, with lots of wardrobe space and comfortable beds. They even gave us English breakfast tea, which after being away from England for 6 weeks we really appreciated! 
The flat is close to multiple subway stations making it easy to get around both Brooklyn and to Manhattan. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay in Brooklyn and would return myself ! "
20734,39417803,23/7/15,37040889,François,"Nous avons été accueilli comme des amis.
Le logement est parfait, il est fonctionnel et il y a tout ce qui est necessaire.
Le quartier est bien, l'appartement est proche de toutes les commodités, transports et commerces.
Il y a toutes les lignes de métro pour se rendre rapidement partout à Manhattan.
Sean & Lynette sont aux petits soins de leurs hôtes."
20734,39994761,27/7/15,37579407,Jp,"This was our first airbnb experience and we loved it. The apartment was exactly as described and pictured. Very clean, spacious and functional. Sean and Lynette were helpful and attentive to our needs, without ever being in our way or intrusive. The location was perfect for us. It seems that everything you might need is within proximity, and you can easily access the subway to Manhattan, or walk to prospect park, go to Coney Island, etc... The necessities were all provided, and even included some child-appropriate plastic ware, which came in handy since we had a toddler with us. We even had a ""welcome basket"", which was a very nice touch. We would definitely recommend this airbnb and will likely stay there again, next time we come to Brooklyn/NYC. I rarely give anything 5/5 stars, but I don't see how this experience could have been much better."
20734,41791230,9/8/15,559949,Sarah,"Sean and Lynette's place was the absolute perfect choice for my two week trip to Brooklyn. I was working on archival research at several area libraries, and not only is the apartment centrally located in terms of public transportation, it's also in a quiet building, so I was able to work ""at home"" on my writing project. This was the most important part for me. The apartment is bright, clean, and breezy. Sean and Lynette were wonderful hosts and my experience with them was nothing but positive. They responded to my request promptly, Lynette greeted me upon my arrival and showed me around the apartment, Sean was available to help me get online, and both of them were around in case I needed anything during my long stay.
I didn't need anything because everything one might need was available in the apartment. If you, like me, like to shop at local markets and cook at home, you'll find cooking basics in the kitchen. If you, like me, need more than one towel, you'll find ample linens provided. If you, like me, enjoy a vibrant neighborhood, Prospect Heights and the neighboring Fort Greene offer plenty of amazing restaurants, bars, parks, and shops. You can walk to the Brooklyn Library, Brooklyn Museum, Botanical Gardens, and Prospect Park. The Barclays Center is very close. The Atlantic Center train hub is minutes away should you want to go into Manhattan for any reason...not that you would, since Brooklyn offers the best of NYC. 
As a longtime Brooklyn resident prior to moving to Colorado, I was happily at home in this beautiful apartment. I will absolutely request to stay again and bring my family along so they can enjoy and get to know Brooklyn the way I did when I lived there. "
20734,43248212,18/8/15,35342065,Simon,"The apartment was very well positioned, comfortable, rather calm and really spacious (We were 4 adults and had plenty of space). The building itself is a typical Brooklyn building that you would expect for enjoying a great NYC experience. Metro is a few blocks away and this makes easy any day-trip to Manhattan or journey to JFK airport. Sean & Lynette had prepared everything for our arrival and are really nice people. I definitely recommend this place. "
20734,43802005,22/8/15,38273733,Stefan,"We very much enjoyed our stay in Sean & Lynette's appartment. First of all,  Sean and Lynette were helpful and flexible when we arrived a few hours before check-in time and that they allowed us to put our luggage into the appartment until it was nicely cleaned up for us. The location of the appartment is great with only a few minutes walk to several subway lines. The appartment was definitely spacious enough for the four of us (including our two teenagers). Only, for a longer stay, 1-2 airbeds would represent a more comfortable alternative than the two sofa beds. "
20734,44921009,30/8/15,13063046,Sophie,"Idéal pour un séjour à New York à partir de Brooklyn , avec un point très important, la proximité d'une station de métro ou passent 6 lignes, permettant un accès rapide et facile aux différents quartiers de Manhatan- le quêtiez est agréable, pratique, le logement est très  fonctionnel et Sean et Lynette sont aux petits soins, très gentils et disponibles. Excellent choix a tout point de vue!"

 The apartment is exactly as described and pictured. Clean, spacious, functional and fulfilled with natural light. Sean and Lynette were helpful and attentive to our needs. We arrived early in the morning and in the last day we´ve left late at night, but they opened their house to leave our luggage without any problem. The location was perfect, excellent connected from airport and to Manhattan."

The owners were lovely people and supplied every amenity. After days of walking in New York, returning to the apartment gave the feeling of ""being back home"". We will certainly rent again when back in Brooklyn! "
20734,51268532,19/10/15,29763333,Maximiliano Fernando,"Sean and Lynette were great hosts and very hospitable. They asked us all the time if everything was OK in the apartment. The apartment was large, bright , very comfortable, and located near the subway and shopping. The neighborhood was quiet and beautiful. Definitely. The hosts and the department are highly recommended."
20734,51739036,24/10/15,43947913,Aurélien,"Sean & lynette were great hosts. They welcomed us in their house on the first day and gave us a lot of infos about the place, the neighborhood and things to do in Brooklyn and in Manhattan. The appartment is spacious and well oriented so that there is a lot of light when it is sunny outside. The appartment is very well furnished with everything you need in the kitchen. It is also very clean and we appreciated it. The appartment is very close to the barclays center and its Metro station with several lines to go to Manhattan. We also enjoyed to spend time in Brooklyn and the appartment is well located to explore this place. We really recommand this place (5 stars without hesitation) and we look forward to come back to it next time we come to NYC. "
20734,52046138,26/10/15,480865,Megan,"Sean and Lynette could not have been more helpful.  Lovely place to stay with two small children (not greeted everywhere with smiles -- so it was lovely to have such a warm welcome!)  Easy dinner delivery from loads of good nearby restaurants, playground across the street for working off energy in the afternoon between ""grown up"" stuff.  Everything clean and well thought out.  Easy walk to the subway, no problem with taxis, uber, or shuttle to the airport from this location."
20734,54307411,18/11/15,10383730,Galia,"Lynette and Sean have a great place in Brooklyn, and we loved staying there. They were generous and gracious hosts that made every effort to make sure that we were comfortable and felt welcome. For us the location was perfect, affordable but close enough to transportation to easily reach Manhattan and walking distance to many fun areas in Brooklyn. The apartment was well equipt, beautiful, and spotless. (It was even nicer in reality than in the photos). So thank you, Sean and Lynette. We hope to be back soon. "
20734,54996586,27/11/15,46578961,Sarah,"The stay at Sean & Lynette's AirBnB was amazing! The apartment was exactly as presented in the photos, we had a little welcoming basket and they provided us with everything we needed, including very helpful restaurant tips. Our lovely hosts were always available and made our stay a truly great experience! Thank you! Sean even walked us to the subway station in the end so that we would get the best connection to the airport... couldn't imagine better hosts and I would definitely try to book with them again when I come back to NY.
Regarding the apartment: Its spacious and light and definitely big enough for four people to sleep in. The location is also very convenient, since its just a walk of a couple of minutes to the next subway station and we (three girls) always felt save in the neighborhood. I can surley recommend to stay with Sean & Lynette! It was wonderful!"
20734,56778148,18/12/15,38743559,Julie,"Perfect location and great apartment! Lynette and Sean are great hosts, always willing to help...we really appreciated their help and their warm welcome.

Lynette et Sean sont des hotes parfaits, toujours prêts à aider...nous avons vraiment apprécié leur aide et leur accueil chaleureux. L'appartement est très calme. Nous recommendons sans réserve cet appartement."
20734,57507608,27/12/15,6684616,Stacy,"Le logement correspond aux photos, vous n'aurez pas de mauvaises surprises. 
Le quartier est vraiment sympa, il y a deux stations de métro à 5 min de marche du logement et des fast food et restaurants à proximité pour les soirs ou vous n'avez pas envie de prendre le métro pour manger.
Sean et Lynette sont très sympatiques, à l écoute et prêt à vous aider en cas de problèmes ou questions.
En bref nous avons passé un excellent séjour et nous recommandons ce logement."
20734,58780627,5/1/16,38451234,Roberto,"Sean & Lynette are fantastic, the house was spotless, warm and equipped with all the basic necessities including milk, water, biscuits, coffee, tea etc ...(unexpected!!) we arrived in the evening and we were able to rest immediately. Sean & Lynette are organized and always available, we communicated with the AIRbnb app  for everything and if necessary helped us in person. Council very much their home. I hope to see them again soon."
20734,59476511,11/1/16,33158848,Silvia,"Sean and Lynette were both there to greet us even though we arrived quite a bit later than expected.  They were kind enough to provide excellent recommendations for a late dinner, showed us around, and even helped us up the stairs with our bags.  They were unfailingly kind and attentive throughout the remainder of our visit, occasionally checking in and responding immediately to any message.  They are fantastic hosts and meeting them was an unexpected highlight of the trip.  The apartment is lovely- clean, spacious, and well lit.  In my opinion it looks even nicer than the pictures.  The four of us were very comfortable there, and even though we didn't cook much we were very grateful for the keurig, kettle, and complementary coffee and tea for our morning drinks!  It's also very well connected, just minutes away from two subway stops, and with a ton of great restaurants and bars around the corner.  We will definitely stay here again when we return to NYC!"
20734,60216007,20/1/16,51808780,Fernando,"Well, Lynette and his husband were an excellent hosts. They gave you a warm welcome and they make you feel at home immediately. They offer you help in all what you need. Our experience in this airbnb was awesome, everything was perfect and more. The neighborhood is secure and calm. You got a lot of things close to the apartment: restaurants, supermarket, laundry, the subway (so you can move to all NYC). The apartment was very clean, its cozy and it has all the amenities you'll need (food, wifi, great beds, heating/air condicioner, good kitchen). Me and my family highly recommend this air bnb!! You'll no regret cause the owners will make you stay a pleasure."
20734,60684735,26/1/16,19737201,Natasha,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Brooklyn at Sean and Lynette's even though the weather was less than cooperative with our plans to explore NYC.  We endured the worst storm to hit New York they said in 10 years and we couldn't have asked for better hosts to be snowed in with.  They were attentive to our every need, checking in with us via email to ensure we had everything we needed and personal visits to their place for this and that were pleasant and welcoming.
  
For the days we were able to get out everything was very accessible and convenient.  The subway a 5 minute walk, easy peasy to get to Manhattan and other great areas, great neighborhoods with fantastic restaurants and cafes within short walking distance, and the beautiful Prospect Park minutes away as well.

The apartment is exactly as shown in the photos, it is spacious, very clean, and has a fully stocked kitchen, they even had a few kitchen staples there for us when we arrived which was a very nice touch.

I can't say enough nice things about Sean and Lynette, they really made us feel comfortable in their place and really just salt of the earth type people that we feel so lucky to have met! We will be in contact with them for future visits to NYC!"

Sean and Lynette were very helpful and accommodating with any questions we had, and even stocked the kitchen with coffee, fresh fruit, and snacks for our stay. The apartment was very clean and comfortable and SO convenient to catching a bunch of different subway lines into Manhattan. The neighborhood itself had yummy restaurants and cute shops in easy walking distance."
20734,66354229,22/3/16,12474663,Lynn,"Well, could this apartment have been handier or more spacious? No!  We had four very tall adults staying there over a long weekend, and we  were all very comfortable.  Sean and Lynette are friendly and welcoming and we really appreciated the pint of fresh milk, cheese, crackers and apples waiting for us in the fridge.  We loved Brooklyn--who knew? And this apartment was a tiny stone's throw from the Barclay's Centre, where we enjoyed a weekend of basketball and just as close to two subway stops, so we could nip into Manhattan really quickly for sight seeing.  Thank you Sean and Lynette, for being such gracious hosts and for sharing your spacious, bright and comfortable apartment with us. "
20734,67368496,29/3/16,17810669,Oscar,"Sean and Lynette are very nice people. The appartment is very well located in Brooklyn near public transport. It's nice, clean and well fournished. Very comfortable. A good choice to visit NYC."

Totalmente recomendable."
20734,77821879,3/6/16,46853404,Jean,"Sean & Lynette sont charmants et accuillants (du lait, du fromage de l'eau en bouteille et autre était disposés dans le frigo à note attention), discrets, agréables (ils ont pris de nos nouvelles par téléphone lors de notre séjour) et serviables (nous avons eu une clim en panne qui a été réparée dans la journée). Le quartier est très sure et fort agréable. On y trouve des rues animées et branchées avec beaucoup de bons restos, de bars et de boutiques tendances. Le métro à seulement 5 minutes à pied est parfait puisque presque toutes les lignes reliant Manhattan sont proposées (donc très peu de correspondances à utiliser durant le séjour) et la liaison avec l'aéroport est simple et assez rapide. L'appartement est très agréable et spacieux avec beaucoup de rangements. Seul petit point négatif, le frigo qui fait beaucoup de bruit donc la nuit pensez à vous munir de boules kies si vous dormez dans le salon (du coup on entend plus rien c'est parfait) et un matelas assez mou concernant le canapé lit du salon. Il manque également 1 ou 2 couverts de plus. 
Des hôtes et un appartement que nous recommandons et nous retournerons bien volontiers chez Sean et Lynette lors d'un prochain week-end à New York."
20734,79082893,11/6/16,35198805,Zhili,"Very good place, great location, spend only five minutes you can arrive subway station. And the host is also very nice and help. The guid she gives to us is very useful!  "

Thank you very much for your kindness, the apartment is great and the wonderful neighborhood. Lynette and Sean are very helpful, friendly, excellent hosts. The apartment is in perfect condition and they are available all day. It is very safe, 2 blocks from the subway, which runs all day. There are everything in the area, even if you do not want to go to Manhattan there are many options.
Brookyn is great!!! I recommend the place 100%!!!!
We will be back!!! Regards Daniel "

Le quartier est calme et une zone commerciale bien pratique est à proximité. Le matelas du canapé lit n'est pas parfait et un peu de vaisselle supplémentaire serait la bienvenue mais cela n'entache en rien notre grande satisfaction d'avoir choisi cet appartement. Pour parfaire le tout, Sean et Lynette ont été accueillants, disponibles et soucieux de notre bien être. Merci à eux."

El barrio muy seguro y tranquilo. Nos encantó! "
20734,100756347,10/9/16,8517604,Gaidig,"We spent 3 nights in New York and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Sean & Lynettes' place. Great flat and location. Big underground station within 5 min walk. Sean & Lynette are great hosts, very friendly and available at all time. Sean welcomed us despite our very late arrival. The smart ""lock box"" system allows very flexible arrivals. It was a touching surprise to discover apples, milk, cheese and coffee waiting for us. Lots of shops and restaurants in the area and a deli round the corner. Thank you Sean & Lynette, we had a great time in NY. We definitely recommend this flat and wouldn't hesitate to book it again.
Nous avons passé 3 nuits à New York avec nos deux filles (grandes ados). L'appartement était parfait, exactement comme sur les photos. Très bien situé, à 5 mn d'une grande station de métro, à 2 pas de nombreux commerces et restaurants et dans un quartier ""safe"" et sympathique. Les filles ont adoré le WiFi hyper performant ;-) Sean & Lynette sont des hôtes accueillants et disponibles. Sean nous a accueilli malgré notre arrivée très tardive. D'ailleurs un système ingénieux d'une ""lock box"" permet une grande flexibilité. Nous avons aussi beaucoup apprécié la gentille attention : pommes, lait, fromage, crackers dans le frigo. Un appartement que nous recommandons et n'hésiterions pas à choisir lors d'un future passage à NY à 4."
20734,102941386,19/9/16,3375036,Ruth,"My parents and I just had a great week in Sean and Lynette's apartment. 

The spacious apartment has everything that a guest needs from complimentary tooth brushes and toothpaste to a little manual with all the important info about the apartment and the area from getting a taxi to eating out.

Sean and Lynette themselves were really nice and accommodating. They answered messages super swiftly and even let me stow my luggage in the closet and hold on to the key until long after check-out time.

All this helped my parents and me to have the perfect NY experience. 

Thank you, Sean & Lynette!"

Ils ont été disponibles pour nous, jusqu à nous accompagner au train pour le retour vers l aéroport le dernier jour.
Quant à l appartement, conforme à la description, est proche de toutes commodités et à l écart de la vie tumultueuse de Manhattan et quelques denrées alimentaires nous y attendaient à notre arrivée.
Bref, rien a dire sauf recommander cet endroit pour un séjour à New York dans la simplicité!
Sean et lynette ne changez rien, vous êtes parfaits!"
20734,109279058,20/10/16,25598124,Lars,"It was a great apartment, and Sean and Lynette was very nice. There was milk, chiese, 2 bier, coffee and more ind the kitchen. The apartment was like the photo and it was it was very good placed to downtown and subways in Brooklyn. Stay here, it´s much  better than Manhatten. It is easy to travel to Manhatten. And it is more silent and the ""real"" New York. 

Vi var meget glade for at bo her. Vores værtspar er meget søde, og det kan kun anbefales. Eneste kommentar kunne være, at der kun var rent, ikke superrent. Lejligheden er lidt slidt, men det gør faktisk ingenting. Dobbeltsengen var rigtig god at ligge i. Man skal dog være opmærksom på, at det er på 2 sal uden elevator med en ret smal trappe. Lejligheden er rigtig god til par med 2 børn."

20734,113011309,9/11/16,29588775,Linda,"Sean and Lynette checked with us before and during our visit to see if every part of our stay was going smoothly.  Since they couldn't be there when we checked in, there were detailed instructions on how to obtain the keys.  That went smoothly, no problems.  One evening, they came up to introduce themselves, and we thoroughly enjoyed talking with them.  We could have visited longer, but it was getting late!  I had a question on getting a dependable taxi very early in the morning, and after messaging on the AB&B site, Sean replied in a timely manner!  (The taxi was right on time, also!)  The apartment was fantastic!  Easy to walk to subway, good food nearby (Donut Plant, Gino's Pizza, Bergan's Bagels)! Shopping, too, if you want. Even a grocery store close if you need one! The neighborhood was quiet, safe to walk through.  We felt very secure and comfortable walking in the neighborhood both during the day and in the evening/after dark.  The apartment looked like the pictures!  Clean, neat, Keurig, coffee pods - they even had fruit, cheese, and crackers upon arrival!  I would definitely stay at their place again, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it!  "

20734,121952300,19/12/16,37660780,Rachel,"This is a thoughtfully planned AirBnB place for travellers. It was spotlessly clean, all the essentials were provided, plus plenty of non-essentials like milk and pasta. Sean was attentive but not intrusive. And the place is great! Plenty of space for a family of four, just round the corner to the subway straight into Manhattan, but quiet (for New York). We loved it!"

The Long Island Rail Road is just a few blocks away so getting there from Kennedy is simple and less than $10. The subway that services the Barclays Center pretty much goes everywhere. There is a ton of shopping and great food (Don Chingon for mexican, James for brunch, Patsy's for Pizza) just a short walk away. The unit is safe and clean, has nice water pressure and plenty of hot water in the shower, and the kitchen is more than adequate. The back bedroom is huge and the pull out couch bed is comfortable. There is a Bluetooth speaker, fast WiFi and the towels were soft. The owners were very accommodating to some last minute emergency changes in plans that occurred, and getting in and checking out was a breeze. Overall a perfect airbnb experience that was also a great value."

Some juicy apples were waiting for us as welcome :) In round about 10 minutes walkway you can arrive the subway station at Barclay Center. From there it´s easy to go to Manhattan or JFK-airport (better to take the LIRR). We always felt safe in this area and we can recommend this lovely home! "

Sean & Lynette were great hosts, they stopped by one evening for a chat which resulted in a birthday pie being given to my sister for her birthday - A+ hosting!! Next time we find ourselves in New York we will be looking to re-book, highly recommended! "

Die Beschreibung der 2-Zi Wohnung entspricht der Ausschreibung. Sie ist in einem Wohngebiet, relativ ruhig gelegen, mit guter Verkehrsanbindung. Zur Subway-Haltestelle Atlantic-Barclaycenter sind es 5 min. zu Fuß. Dort gibt es auch ein großes Einkaufszentrum. Nach Midtown Manhatten fährt man ca. 30 min.
Die Gastgeber sind sehr hilfsbereit und freundlich. 
Nächstes Mal sind wir gerne wieder dort.

20734,161792207,18/6/17,12672113,Caroline,"Sean and Lynette were such gracious hosts and their apartment was perfect! The apartment was very clean and spacious, and we appreciated the coffee and snacks they left for us. Sean and Lynette checked in by text throughout our visit to make sure everything was going well and went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay. We could not have asked for a better experience! Thanks :-)"
20734,165231942,30/6/17,81444467,Ximena,"El departamento fue tal y como lo vimos en fotos, y quedamos muy contentos por la cercanía que había de la estación del metro que conecta en 20 minutos con Manhattan, ademas esta la estación de trenes, que también nos resulto muy fácil usar, y conocer los afueras de Nueva York.  Muchos negocios cerca, supermercados y botilleria. El departamento cómodo y muy privado, con todo lo necesario para llegar a descansar después de muchas caminatas. Todo perfecto y de acuerdo a lo que nosotros esperábamos como familia.
Sean y Lynette siempre estuvieron pendientes por mensajería si necesitábamos algo mas de lo que había en el departamento. Felices por las 2 semanas es nos alojamos ahí."
20734,167923607,8/7/17,14535286,Hind,"The appartement is very close from a metro station where you can catch several of the main metro lines to go to Manhattan or other places. Sean and Lynette were very nice and quick to answer to any questions before and during our stay. The appartement is spacious and convenient. The principal bedroom is very comfortable, however I would recommand the sofa bed only for children or young adults as it's a bit old and not very comfortable for two people. When we arrived we had fruits, milk, several kind of biscuits and coffee waiting for us which is very appreciable. We really enjoyed our stay at Sean and Lynette's place! "

We were greeted by a welcome book with recommendations of places to eat, house rules, and wifi password. Our hosts also left some snacks in the fridge for us with a stocked coffee and tea bar after our flight was delayed by 3 hours. Spacious living/kitchen/dining and bedroom areas allowed us to spread out and feel settled into the space. Netflix was a welcome add-on on breaks between sightseeing. We are very grateful for the opportunity to stay in their clean, comfy, and convenient apartment, and we hope to stay there again in the future. Highly recommend!"

20734,205611629,22/10/17,6215475,Darren,"Sean & Lynette's place is a perfect example of an outstanding Airbnb experience.
Their place is as described, and is perfectly located.  In a fantastic part of Brooklyn - super convenient to Manhattan, but still in it's own self-sufficient area with great shops, cafes, restaurants around.  Felt very safe (there is a police station and fire station on the block) and the street was a great example of a New York street - literally a perfect location for exploring NYC but feeling like a local.
The apartment has everything you need, and is really spacious, and has multiple bed options.  Feels homely, yet clean and uncluttered.  There were lovely touches I didn't expect like a fully stocked coffee machine and snacks.  So much space, closet space and was generally quiet and comfortable.
I have nothing bad to say about the place.
Sean and Lynette introduced themselves, were lovely and made themselves available during the stay to help.
I will definitely be returning here on my next trip. Loved it, and loved their hosting."
20734,208364801,1/11/17,104678427,Yann,"Nous avons passé une très bonne semaine chez Sean et Lynette. 
L'appartement est conforme à ce qui est dit dans l'annonce.Il est propre, dans une rue calme mais très proche de rues plus animées (restos, supermarché, galeries,...). Les stations de métro très proches aussi sont très pratiques pour relier Manhattan rapidement.
Sean et Lynette sont très accueillants et sont prêts à répondre à toutes nos questions ou autres demandes (ils nous ont imprimé des billets de match NBA, par exemple).
Nous recommandons vivement ce logement!"
20734,209836646,6/11/17,5940140,Stefano & Giovanna,"Sean and Lynette are wonderful host: friendly, very polite and always present in communication. Their apartment was clean and confortable, very well equipped with all we need. Check in and check out were perfect and easy and they also let us know stay some hours more than standard. We also loved the area, close to atlantic station for train and many metro lines and to prospect park. Thaks for all!"
20734,211340114,12/11/17,26878087,Leslie,"This apartment is better than it's pictures!  It's very spacious with good beds and a nice bathroom and kitchen set up. The building is quiet and it seems to be in a very safe neighborhood. We brought a car and there was 24 hour parking around the corner. Did not use the car in the city as the public transportation was close by. The neighborhood has great restaurants and shops and most places were very reasonable. Sean and Lynette answered all questions quickly and checked in with us by the inbox almost daily. There were thoughtful and essential items in the kitchen including milk for coffee, fresh fruit, coffee, tea and cheese. That was all very welcome as we checked in quite late at night. Would definitely stay here again"

20734,224590647,3/1/18,124229246,Inna,"We spent 10 days in NY with kids. Our major goal was to see all major sightseens of Manhatten and surroundings. I was searching for a long time and chose this place. We could't find anything better for our budget. It's a quite street but just 5 minutes away from big subway hub Atlantic/Barclays center. Large supermarket, department stores, cafes they are all very close. Apartment is in historical building and has atmosphere. The most important for me that everything was very very very clean: clean linens and towels, clean dishes, clean bathroom, clean apartment. Supplies of good coffee and tea, some basics in kitchen cabinets and fridge - it was all very nice. I was cooking and found all dishware I need for that. And we get instant response from our dear hosts for all our requests. It was as low as 15 F outside but very warm in the apartment. And you can always ask to adjust termostat. Beds are comfortable - its full beds not convertibles.
Sean and Lynette, thank you for making us feel at home! We had great experience and surely stay with you if visit NY again."
20734,228617073,20/1/18,100359,Rudy,This place was a good as advertised and even better! They hosts were extremely accommodating and left no request unanswered.

20734,250568011,5/4/18,88769958,Sandy,"We enjoyed our stay at Sean and Lynette's place for our Spring break trip to NY with our 2 kids. Their place is clean, comfortable, quiet and close to several subway and bus stops.  It took about 30 minutes to get to Times Square area in Manhattan.  If you come with a car, it is a struggle to find free street parking.  We found a great spot, but had to move it due to street cleaning and had to park in a parking garage that was over $40 a day.  Just something to keep in mind if you are driving. Sean and Lynette's place is a great value for being near lots of shops, restaurants and the subway. We would stay there again!"
20734,252903113,12/4/18,34421308,Natacha,"Nous avons été extrêmement satisfaits de l'appartement de Sean et Lynette. Nous sommes partis en famille avec nos deux enfants. C'est un appartement très pratique pour les familles, à 5 minutes à pieds des métros pour aller à Manhattan très accessible pour aller aussi bien au nord ou au sud de Manhattan y compris tard le soir. Nous nous sommes sentis en sécurité dans ce quartier. L'appartement est situé dans une rue plutôt calme, très reposant après une journée à Manhattan. Nous avons pu nous préparer à manger tous les soirs à l'appartement, il y a des magasins pour acheter à manger à 5 minutes à pied, nous allions souvent au Whole food market pour acheter de la nourriture bio (  proximité du métro atlantic barclay ). Lynette et Sean ont répondu très rapidement à toutes nos demandes et ont tout fait pour nous arranger. L'appartement est grand avec une grande chambre et un grand salon ( avec un lit 2 places dans le salon) la literie est bonne, L'appartement était très propre. je conseille fortement cet appartement nous avons été très très contents et cela a contribué à la réussite de notre voyage."
